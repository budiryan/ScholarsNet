- All legit paper dois start with '10.'
- dois from arxiv might not have one to one mapping with the title
- very similar title and same author but different paper
- doi actually helps, but not really helpful, considering the problems we have above.
- Same paper but different title with some misspells. Examples: 'Exploit' & 'Expoit'
- We used cosine similarity for the data portal search engine

The 4 different algorithms are: 
Pure jaccard similarity algorithm with similarity threshold = 0.75
Modified jaccard similarity algorithm (For intersection part, we use string edit distance with a threshold)
Directly comparing the 2 strings 
Use string edit distance with a threshold = len(max(string 1, string 2)) / 4

- Precision rate for each algorithm:
Jaccard_sed: 0.67
jaccard_strict : 0.69
Strict_compare: 1.0
String edit distance: 0.46

- New trial thresholds:
Jaccard_sed: 0.125, 0.9
jaccard_strict: 0.9
sed: 0.125
