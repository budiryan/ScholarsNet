These exponents yield asymptotic\nupper bounds on the achievable log probability of error. In our model,\ninformation is to be reliably transmitted through a noisy channel with finite\ninput and output alphabets and random state sequence, and the channel is\nselected by a hypothetical adversary. Partial information about the state\nsequence is available to the encoder, adversary, and decoder. The design of the\ntransmitter is subject to a cost constraint. Two families of channels are\nconsidered: 1) compound discrete memoryless channels (CDMC), and 2) channels\nwith arbitrary memory, subject to an additive cost constraint, or more\ngenerally to a hard constraint on the conditional type of the channel output\ngiven the input. Both problems are closely connected. The random-coding\nexponent is achieved using a stacked binning scheme and a maximum penalized\nmutual information decoder, which may be thought of as an empirical generalized\nMaximum a Posteriori decoder. For channels with arbitrary memory, the\nrandom-coding exponents are larger than their CDMC counterparts.

Here we find the\nfeedback capacity of the stationary first-order moving average additive\nGaussian noise channel in closed form. Specifically, the channel is given by\n$Y_i = X_i + Z_i,$ $i = 1, 2, ...,$ where the input $\\{X_i\\}$ satisfies a power\nconstraint and the noise $\\{Z_i\\}$ is a first-order moving average Gaussian\nprocess defined by $Z_i = \\alpha U_{i-1} + U_i,$ $|\\alpha| \\le 1,$ with white\nGaussian innovations $U_i,$ $i = 0,1,....$\n  We show that the feedback capacity of this channel is $-\\log x_0,$ where\n$x_0$ is the unique positive root of the equation $ \\rho x^2 = (1-x^2) (1 -\n|\\alpha|x)^2,$ and $\\rho$ is the ratio of the average input power per\ntransmission to the variance of the noise innovation $U_i$. The optimal coding\nscheme parallels the simple linear signalling scheme by Schalkwijk and Kailath\nfor the additive white Gaussian noise channel -- the transmitter sends a\nreal-valued information-bearing signal at the beginning of communication and\nsubsequently refines the receiver's error by processing the feedback noise\nsignal through a linear stationary first-order autoregressive filter. The\nresulting error probability of the maximum likelihood decoding decays\ndoubly-exponentially in the duration of the communication. This feedback\ncapacity of the first-order moving average Gaussian channel is very similar in\nform to the best known achievable rate for the first-order\n\\emph{autoregressive} Gaussian noise channel studied by Butman, Wolfowitz, and\nTiernan, although the optimality of the latter is yet to be established."

    "summary": "Geographic routing with greedy relaying strategies have been widely studied\nas a routing scheme in sensor networks. These schemes assume that the nodes\nhave perfect information about the location of the destination. When the\ndistance between the source and destination is normalized to unity, the\nasymptotic routing delays in these schemes are $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{M(n)}),$ where\nM(n) is the maximum distance traveled in a single hop (transmission range of a\nradio). In this paper, we consider routing scenarios where nodes have location\nerrors (imprecise GPS), or where only coarse geographic information about the\ndestination is available, and only a fraction of the nodes have routing\ninformation. We show that even with such imprecise or limited\ndestination-location information, the routing delays are\n$\\Theta(\\frac{1}{M(n)})$. We also consider the throughput-capacity of networks\nwith progressive routing strategies that take packets closer to the destination\nin every step, but not necessarily along a straight-line. We show that the\nthroughput-capacity with progressive routing is order-wise the same as the\nmaximum achievable throughput-capacity."

Furthermore, the eigenvalues of the equivalent channel are\nindependent identically distributed random variables each following a\nnoncentral chi-square distribution with $4n_R$ degrees of freedom.\n  Based on these important insights into the structure of the QSTBC, we derive\nan analytical lower bound for the fraction of outage probability achieved with\nQSTBC and show that this bound is tight for low signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)\nvalues and also for increasing number of receive antennas. We also present an\nupper bound, which is tight for high SNR values and derive analytical\nexpressions for the case of four transmit antennas.

This relationship holds for both scalar and vector signals, as well\nas for discrete-time and continuous-time noncausal MMSE estimation.

The general problem is unsolved. Hence, we focus on\ncomparing two commonly used source and channel encoding systems which\ncorrespond to exploiting diversity either at the physical layer through\nparallel channel coding or at the application layer through multiple\ndescription source coding.\n  For on-off channel models, source coding diversity offers better performance.\nFor channels with a continuous range of reception quality, we show the reverse\nis true. Specifically, we introduce a new figure of merit called the distortion\nexponent which measures how fast the average distortion decays with SNR. For\ncontinuous-state models such as additive white Gaussian noise channels with\nmultiplicative Rayleigh fading, optimal channel coding diversity at the\nphysical layer is more efficient than source coding diversity at the\napplication layer in that the former achieves a better distortion exponent.\n  Finally, we consider a third decoding architecture: multiple description\nencoding with a joint source-channel decoding. We show that this architecture\nachieves the same distortion exponent as systems with optimal channel coding\ndiversity for continuous-state channels, and maintains the the advantages of\nmultiple description systems for on-off channels. Thus, the multiple\ndescription system with joint decoding achieves the best performance, from\namong the three architectures considered, on both continuous-state and on-off\nchannels."

Transmission over frequency-selective channels is considered and the\neffects of inter-frame interference and multiple access interference on the\nperformance of a generic Rake receiver are investigated for both synchronous\nand asynchronous systems. Closed form (approximate) expressions for the\nprobability of error that are valid for various Rake combining schemes are\nderived. The asynchronous system is modelled as a chip-synchronous system with\nuniformly distributed timing jitter for the transmitted pulses of interfering\nusers. This model allows the analytical technique developed for the synchronous\ncase to be extended to the asynchronous case. An approximate closed-form\nexpression for the probability of bit error, expressed in terms of the\nautocorrelation function of the transmitted pulse, is derived for the\nasynchronous case. Then, transmission over an additive white Gaussian noise\nchannel is studied as a special case, and the effects of multiple-access\ninterference is investigated for both synchronous and asynchronous systems. The\nanalysis shows that the chip-synchronous assumption can result in\nover-estimating the error probability, and the degree of over-estimation mainly\ndepends on the autocorrelation function of the ultra-wideband pulse and the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the system.

The MDL estimator is\nknown to be a consistent estimator, robust against deviations from the Gaussian\nassumption, and non-robust against deviations from the point source and/or\ntemporally or spatially white additive noise assumptions. Over the years\nseveral alternative estimation algorithms have been proposed and tested.\nUsually, these algorithms are shown, using computer simulations, to have\nimproved performance over the MDL estimator, and to be robust against\ndeviations from the assumed spatial model. Nevertheless, these robust\nalgorithms have high computational complexity, requiring several\nmulti-dimensional searches.\n  In this paper, motivated by real life problems, a systematic approach toward\nthe problem of robust estimation of the number of sources using information\ntheoretic criteria is taken. An MDL type estimator that is robust against\ndeviation from assumption of equal noise level across the array is studied. The\nconsistency of this estimator, even when deviations from the equal noise level\nassumption occur, is proven. A novel low-complexity implementation method\navoiding the need for multi-dimensional searches is presented as well, making\nthis estimator a favorable choice for practical applications."

    "summary": "Convex relaxations of the optimal finger selection algorithm are proposed for\na minimum mean square error (MMSE) Rake receiver in an impulse radio\nultra-wideband system. First, the optimal finger selection problem is\nformulated as an integer programming problem with a non-convex objective\nfunction. Then, the objective function is approximated by a convex function and\nthe integer programming problem is solved by means of constraint relaxation\ntechniques. The proposed algorithms are suboptimal due to the approximate\nobjective function and the constraint relaxation steps. However, they can be\nused in conjunction with the conventional finger selection algorithm, which is\nsuboptimal on its own since it ignores the correlation between multipath\ncomponents, to obtain performances reasonably close to that of the optimal\nscheme that cannot be implemented in practice due to its complexity. The\nproposed algorithms leverage convexity of the optimization problem\nformulations, which is the watershed between `easy' and `difficult'\noptimization problems."

    "summary": "One of the features characterizing almost every multiple access (MA)\ncommunication system is the processing gain. Through the use of spreading\nsequences, the processing gain of Random CDMA systems (RCDMA), is devoted to\nboth bandwidth expansion and orthogonalization of the signals transmitted by\ndifferent users. Another type of multiple access system is Impulse Radio (IR).\nIn many aspects, IR systems are similar to time division multiple access (TDMA)\nsystems, and the processing gain of IR systems represents the ratio between the\nactual transmission time and the total time between two consecutive\nransmissions (on-plus-off to on ratio). While CDMA systems, which constantly\nexcite the channel, rely on spreading sequences to orthogonalize the signals\ntransmitted by different users, IR systems transmit a series of short pulses\nand the orthogonalization between the signals transmitted by different users is\nachieved by the fact that most of the pulses do not collide with each other at\nthe receiver.\n  In this paper, a general class of MA communication systems that use both\ntypes of processing gain is presented, and both IR and RCDMA systems are\ndemonstrated to be two special cases of this more general class of systems. The\nbit error rate (BER) of several receivers as a function of the ratio between\nthe two types of processing gain is analyzed and compared under the constraint\nthat the total processing gain of the system is large and fixed. It is\ndemonstrated that in non inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels there is no\ntradeoff between the two types of processing gain. However, in ISI channels a\ntradeoff between the two types of processing gain exists. In addition, the\nsub-optimality of RCDMA systems in frequency selective channels is established."

In the proposed game, each user needs to decide how much\npower to transmit over each carrier to maximize its overall utility. The\nutility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits\ntransmitted per joule of energy consumed. It is shown that the user's utility\nis maximized when the user transmits only on the carrier with the best\n\"effective channel\". The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the\nproposed game are investigated and the properties of equilibrium are studied.\nAlso, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the equilibrium (if\nit exists) is presented. It is shown that the proposed approach results in a\nsignificant improvement in the total utility achieved at equilibrium compared\nto the case in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier\nindependently."

We derive expressions for the asymptotic\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) of the MMSE receiver, and both the\ntransient and steady-state SINR of the ALS receiver, trained using either\ni.i.d. data sequences or orthogonal training sequences. The results are in\nterms of key system parameters, and allow for arbitrary distributions of the\npower of each of the data streams and the eigenvalues of the channel\ncorrelation matrix.

Arbitrary input distributions and flat fading\nare considered. A generic multiuser detector in the form of the posterior mean\nestimator is applied before single-user decoding. The generic detector can be\nparticularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear MMSE detector, the\njointly or the individually optimal detector, and others. It is found that the\ndetection output for each user, although in general asymptotically non-Gaussian\nconditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to\ninfinity to a deterministic function of a \"hidden\" Gaussian statistic\nindependent of the interferers. Thus the multiuser channel can be decoupled:\nEach user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose\nsignal-to-noise ratio suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access\ninterference. The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol-error-rate) and the\nmutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation\nfactor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by\nsolving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper.

    "summary": "The multiple description (MD) problem has received considerable attention as\na model of information transmission over unreliable channels. A general\nframework for designing efficient multiple description quantization schemes is\nproposed in this paper. We provide a systematic treatment of the El Gamal-Cover\n(EGC) achievable MD rate-distortion region, and show that any point in the EGC\nregion can be achieved via a successive quantization scheme along with\nquantization splitting. For the quadratic Gaussian case, the proposed scheme\nhas an intrinsic connection with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which\nimplies that the whole Gaussian MD rate-distortion region is achievable with a\nsequential dithered lattice-based quantization scheme as the dimension of the\n(optimal) lattice quantizers becomes large. Moreover, this scheme is shown to\nbe universal for all i.i.d. smooth sources with performance no worse than that\nfor an i.i.d. Gaussian source with the same variance and asymptotically optimal\nat high resolution. A class of low-complexity MD scalar quantizers in the\nproposed general framework also is constructed and is illustrated\ngeometrically; the performance is analyzed in the high resolution regime, which\nexhibits a noticeable improvement over the existing MD scalar quantization\nschemes."

A combined ensemble is composed of a set of simpler\nensembles such as a regular bipartite ensemble. Two classes of combined\nensembles have prime importance; a stacked ensemble and a concatenated\nensemble, which consists of set of stacked matrices and concatenated matrices,\nrespectively. The ACWD formulas of these ensembles is shown in this paper. Such\nformulas are key tools to evaluate the ACWD of a complex combined ensemble.\n  From the ACWD of an ensemble, we can obtain some detailed properties of a\ncode (e.g., weight of coset leaders) which is not available from an average\nweight distribution. Moreover, it is shown that the analysis based on the ACWD\nis indispensable to evaluate the average weight distribution of some classes of\ncombined ensembles."

An upper bound on the minimum degree\nlift needed to realize a particular irreducible lift-realizable pseudocodeword\nis given in terms of its maximal component, and it is shown that all\nirreducible lift-realizable pseudocodewords have components upper bounded by a\nfinite value $t$ that is dependent on the graph structure.

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider a network communications problem in which multiple\ncorrelated sources must be delivered to a single data collector node, over a\nnetwork of noisy independent point-to-point channels. We prove that perfect\nreconstruction of all the sources at the sink is possible if and only if, for\nall partitions of the network nodes into two subsets S and S^c such that the\nsink is always in S^c, we have that H(U_S|U_{S^c}) < \\sum_{i\\in S,j\\in S^c}\nC_{ij}. Our main finding is that in this setup a general source/channel\nseparation theorem holds, and that Shannon information behaves as a classical\nnetwork flow, identical in nature to the flow of water in pipes. At first\nglance, it might seem surprising that separation holds in a fairly general\nnetwork situation like the one we study. A closer look, however, reveals that\nthe reason for this is that our model allows only for independent\npoint-to-point channels between pairs of nodes, and not multiple-access and/or\nbroadcast channels, for which separation is well known not to hold. This\n``information as flow'' view provides an algorithmic interpretation for our\nresults, among which perhaps the most important one is the optimality of\nimplementing codes using a layered protocol stack."

We provide closed-form expressions for\ntransmitter-receiver pairs that simultaneously minimize the arithmetic mean\nsquared error (MSE) at the decision point (assuming perfect feedback), the\ngeometric MSE, and the bit error rate of a uniformly bit-loaded system at\nmoderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios. Separate expressions apply for the\n``zero-forcing'' and ``minimum MSE'' (MMSE) decision feedback structures. In\nthe MMSE case, the proposed design also maximizes the Gaussian mutual\ninformation and suggests that one can approach the capacity of the block\ntransmission system using (independent instances of) the same (Gaussian) code\nfor each element of the block. Our simulation studies indicate that the\nproposed transceivers perform significantly better than standard transceivers,\nand that they retain their performance advantages in the presence of error\npropagation."

The binary input additive white Gaussian noise\nchannel is treated in part 1 of this report. Part 2 extends the results to the\nsymmetric binary channel and to the binary erasure channel and provides an\nheuristic extension to wider class of channel models."

    "summary": "Bounds on the entropy of patterns of sequences generated by independently\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) sources are derived. A pattern is a sequence\nof indices that contains all consecutive integer indices in increasing order of\nfirst occurrence. If the alphabet of a source that generated a sequence is\nunknown, the inevitable cost of coding the unknown alphabet symbols can be\nexploited to create the pattern of the sequence. This pattern can in turn be\ncompressed by itself. The bounds derived here are functions of the i.i.d.\nsource entropy, alphabet size, and letter probabilities. It is shown that for\nlarge alphabets, the pattern entropy must decrease from the i.i.d. one. The\ndecrease is in many cases more significant than the universal coding redundancy\nbounds derived in prior works. The pattern entropy is confined between two\nbounds that depend on the arrangement of the letter probabilities in the\nprobability space. For very large alphabets whose size may be greater than the\ncoded pattern length, all low probability letters are packed into one symbol.\nThe pattern entropy is upper and lower bounded in terms of the i.i.d. entropy\nof the new packed alphabet.

    "summary": "We consider a variation of the Wyner-Ziv problem pertaining to lossy\ncompression of individual sequences using finite-state encoders and decoders.\nThere are two main results in this paper. The first characterizes the\nrelationship between the performance of the best $M$-state encoder-decoder pair\nto that of the best block code of size $\\ell$ for every input sequence, and\nshows that the loss of the latter relative to the former (in terms of both rate\nand distortion) never exceeds the order of $(\\log M)/\\ell$, independently of\nthe input sequence. Thus, in the limit of large $M$, the best rate-distortion\nperformance of every infinite source sequence can be approached universally by\na sequence of block codes (which are also implementable by finite-state\nmachines). While this result assumes an asymptotic regime where the number of\nstates is fixed, and only the length $n$ of the input sequence grows without\nbound, we then consider the case where the number of states $M=M_n$ is allowed\nto grow concurrently with $n$. Our second result is then about the critical\ngrowth rate of $M_n$ such that the rate-distortion performance of $M_n$-state\nencoder-decoder pairs can still be matched by a universal code. We show that\nthis critical growth rate of $M_n$ is linear in $n$."

    "summary": "We consider the Shannon cipher system in a setting where the secret key is\ndelivered to the legitimate receiver via a channel with limited capacity. For\nthis setting, we characterize the achievable region in the space of three\nfigures of merit: the security (measured in terms of the equivocation), the\ncompressibility of the cryptogram, and the distortion associated with the\nreconstruction of the plaintext source. Although lossy reconstruction of the\nplaintext does not rule out the option that the (noisy) decryption key would\ndiffer, to a certain extent, from the encryption key, we show, nevertheless,\nthat the best strategy is to strive for perfect match between the two keys, by\napplying reliable channel coding to the key bits, and to control the distortion\nsolely via rate-distortion coding of the plaintext source before the\nencryption. In this sense, our result has a flavor similar to that of the\nclassical source-channel separation theorem. Some variations and extensions of\nthis model are discussed as well."

These bounds address the question, previously considered by Sason\nand Urbanke, of how sparse can parity-check matrices of binary linear block\ncodes be as a function of the gap to capacity. Similarly to a previously\nreported bound by Sason and Urbanke, the new lower bounds on the parity-check\ndensity scale like the log of the inverse of the gap to capacity, but their\ntightness is improved (except for a binary symmetric/erasure channel, where\nthey coincide with the previous bound). The new upper bounds on the achievable\nrates of binary linear block codes tighten previously reported bounds by\nBurshtein et al., and therefore enable to obtain tighter upper bounds on the\nthresholds of sequences of binary linear block codes under ML decoding.

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose novel cooperative transmission protocols for delay\nlimited coherent fading channels consisting of N (half-duplex and\nsingle-antenna) partners and one cell site. In our work, we differentiate\nbetween the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative\nmultiple-access (up-link) channels. For the relay channel, we investigate two\nclasses of cooperation schemes; namely, Amplify and Forward (AF) protocols and\nDecode and Forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper\nbound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We\nthen construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed\nalgorithm is then extended to the general case with N-1 relays where it is\nshown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Worenell\nwithout requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF\nprotocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves\nthe optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 < r < 1/N. Furthermore, with a\nsingle relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols\nfor all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be\nmore significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is\nreversed in the cooperative multiple-access channel where we propose a new AF\nprotocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A\ndistinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that\nthey do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of\nresources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the sub-optimality of\npreviously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces\nrather than the half-duplex constraint."

To\nillustrate the main ideas, we start with the single group case, i.e., pure\nmulticast, where a common information stream is requested by all the users. We\nconsider three classes of scheduling algorithms with progressively increasing\ncomplexity. The first class strives for minimum complexity by resorting to a\nstatic scheduling strategy along with memoryless decoding. Our analysis for\nthis class of scheduling algorithms reveals the existence of a static\nscheduling policy that achieves the optimal scaling law of the throughput at\nthe expense of a delay that increases exponentially with the number of users.\nThe second scheduling policy resorts to a higher complexity incremental\nredundancy encoding/decoding strategy to achieve a superior throughput-delay\ntradeoff. The third, and most complex, scheduling strategy benefits from the\ncooperation between the different users to minimize the delay while achieving\nthe optimal scaling law of the throughput. In particular, the proposed\ncooperative multicast strategy is shown to simultaneously achieve the optimal\nscaling laws of both throughput and delay. Then, we generalize our scheduling\nalgorithms to exploit the multi-group diversity available when different\ninformation streams are requested by different subsets of the user population.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of the potential gains of equipping the base\nstation with multi-transmit antennas and present simulation results that\nvalidate our theoretical claims."

We restrict ourselves to the class of lattice codes and formulate the\njoint detection and decoding problem as a closest lattice point search (CLPS).\nHere, a tree search framework for solving the CLPS is adopted. In our\nframework, the CLPS algorithm decomposes into the preprocessing and tree search\nstages. The role of the preprocessing stage is to expose the tree structure in\na form {\\em matched} to the search stage. We argue that the minimum mean square\nerror decision feedback (MMSE-DFE) frontend is instrumental for solving the\njoint detection and decoding problem in a single search stage. It is further\nshown that MMSE-DFE filtering allows for using lattice reduction methods to\nreduce complexity, at the expense of a marginal performance loss, and solving\nunder-determined linear systems. For the search stage, we present a generic\nmethod, based on the branch and bound (BB) algorithm, and show that it\nencompasses all existing sphere decoders as special cases. The proposed generic\nalgorithm further allows for an interesting classification of tree search\ndecoders, sheds more light on the structural properties of all known sphere\ndecoders, and inspires the design of more efficient decoders. In particular, an\nefficient decoding algorithm that resembles the well known Fano sequential\ndecoder is identified.

For MIMO diversity schemes, it is already\nknown that. by the optimal antenna selection maximizing the post-processing\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the diversity order of the full system can be\nmaintained. On the other hand, the diversity order achieved by antenna\nselection in spatial multiplexing systems, especially those exploiting\npractical coding and decoding schemes, has not been rigorously analyzed thus\nfar. In this paper, from a geometric standpoint, we propose a new framework for\ntheoretically analyzing the diversity order achieved by transmit antenna\nselection for separately encoded spatial multiplexing systems with linear and\ndecision-feedback receivers. We rigorously show that a diversity order of\n(Nt-1)(Nr-1) can be achieved for an Nr by Nt SM system when L=2 antennas are\nselected from the transmit side; while for L>2 scenarios, we give bounds for\nthe achievable diversity order and show that the optimal diversity order is at\nleast (Nt-L+1)(Nr-L+1) . Furthermore, the same geometrical approach can be used\nto evaluate the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curves for the considered\nspatial multiplexing systems with transmit antenna selection."

The novelty is in reducing a submatrix of the binary parity check\nmatrix that corresponds to less reliable bits to a sparse nature before the SPA\nis applied at each iteration. The proposed algorithm can be geometrically\ninterpreted as a two-stage gradient descent with an adaptive potential\nfunction. This adaptive procedure is crucial to the convergence behavior of the\ngradient descent algorithm and, therefore, significantly improves the\nperformance.

This formulation encompasses many of\nthe special cases studied in the literature and allows for capturing the common\nfeatures shared by them. Here, we focus on three special cases, namely 1) Relay\nChannel, 2) Multicast Channel, and 3) Conference Channel. These special cases\nare judicially chosen to reflect varying degrees of complexity while\nhighlighting the common ground shared by the different variants of the three\nnode wireless network. For the relay channel, we propose a new cooperation\nscheme that exploits the wireless feedback gain. This scheme combines the\nbenefits of decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward strategies and avoids\nthe idealistic feedback assumption adopted in earlier works. Our analysis of\nthe achievable rate of this scheme reveals the diminishing feedback gain at\nboth the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Inspired by the proposed\nfeedback strategy, we identify a greedy cooperation framework applicable to\nboth the multicast and conference channels. Our performance analysis reveals\nseveral nice properties of the proposed greedy approach and the central role of\ncooperative source-channel coding in exploiting the receiver side information\nin the wireless network setting. Our proofs for the cooperative multicast with\nside-information rely on novel nested and independent binning encoders along\nwith a list decoder."

Although\nthe theoretical lower bound for TOA estimation can be achieved by the maximum\nlikelihood principle, it is impractical due to the need for extremely high-rate\nsampling and the presence of large number of multipath components. On the other\nhand, the conventional correlation-based algorithm, which serially searches\npossible signal delays, takes a very long time to estimate the TOA of a\nreceived UWB signal. Moreover, the first signal path does not always have the\nstrongest correlation output. Therefore, first path detection algorithms need\nto be considered. In this paper, a data-aided two-step TOA estimation algorithm\nis proposed. In order to speed up the estimation process, the first step\nestimates the rough TOA of the received signal based on received signal energy.\nThen, in the second step, the arrival time of the first signal path is\nestimated by considering a hypothesis testing approach. The proposed scheme\nuses low-rate correlation outputs, and is able to perform accurate TOA\nestimation in reasonable time intervals. The simulation results are presented\nto analyze the performance of the estimator."

The uplink of a\ndirect-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) data network is\nconsidered and a non-cooperative game is proposed in which users in the network\nare allowed to choose their uplink receivers as well as their transmit powers\nto maximize their own utilities.

In addition, this\nframework is used to study power control games for the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, and the MMSE detector; and the receivers' performance is compared\nin terms of the utilities achieved at equilibrium (in bits/Joule). The optimal\ncooperative solution is also discussed and compared with the non-cooperative\napproach. Extensions of the results to the case of multiple receive antennas\nare also presented.

    "summary": "The performance of Bayesian detection of Gaussian signals using noisy\nobservations is investigated via the error exponent for the average error\nprobability. Under unknown signal correlation structure or limited processing\ncapability it is reasonable to use the simple quadratic detector that is\noptimal in the case of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nsignal. Using the large deviations principle, the performance of this detector\n(which is suboptimal for non-i.i.d. signals) is compared with that of the\noptimal detector for correlated signals via the asymptotic relative efficiency\ndefined as the ratio between sample sizes of two detectors required for the\nsame performance in the large-sample-size regime. The effects of SNR on the ARE\nare investigated. It is shown that the asymptotic efficiency of the simple\nquadratic detector relative to the optimal detector converges to one as the SNR\nincreases without bound for any bounded spectrum, and that the simple quadratic\ndetector performs as well as the optimal detector for a wide range of the\ncorrelation values at high SNR."

The maximum likelihood decoding problem is one of\nthe most important algorithmic problems of a code. While these problems are\nknown to be hard for general linear codes, the techniques used to prove their\nhardness often rely on the construction of artificial codes. In general, much\nless is known about the hardness of the specific classes of natural linear\ncodes. In this paper, we show that both problems are\n  NP-hard for algebraic geometry codes. We achieve this by reducing a\nwell-known NP-complete problem to these problems using a randomized algorithm.\nThe family of codes in the reductions are based on elliptic curves. They have\npositive rates, but the alphabet sizes are exponential in the block lengths."

Given a\nchannel $W$ consisting of two possibly correlated subchannels $W_1$, $W_2$, the\ncapacity function always satisfies $C(W_1)+C(W_2) \\le C(W)$, while there are\nexamples for which $R_0(W_1)+R_0(W_2) > R_0(W)$.

This paper\ndemonstrates that similar gains in cutoff rate can be achieved for general\nDMC's by methods of channel combining and splitting.

Such channels have a large channel\nmemory length, but only a small number of significant channel coefficients. In\nthis paper, trellis-based equalization of sparse ISI channels is revisited. Due\nto the large channel memory length, the complexity of maximum-likelihood\ndetection, e.g., by means of the Viterbi algorithm (VA), is normally\nprohibitive. In the first part of the paper, a unified framework based on\nfactor graphs is presented for complexity reduction without loss of optimality.\nIn this new context, two known reduced-complexity algorithms for sparse ISI\nchannels are recapitulated: The multi-trellis VA (M-VA) and the\nparallel-trellis VA (P-VA). It is shown that the M-VA, although claimed, does\nnot lead to a reduced computational complexity. The P-VA, on the other hand,\nleads to a significant complexity reduction, but can only be applied for a\ncertain class of sparse channels. In the second part of the paper, a unified\napproach is investigated to tackle general sparse channels: It is shown that\nthe use of a linear filter at the receiver renders the application of standard\nreduced-state trellis-based equalizer algorithms feasible, without significant\nloss of optimality.

First, we\ndevelop a simple and accurate analytic technique to evaluate the performance of\nturbo codes in quasi-static fading channels. The proposed analytic technique\nrelates the frame error rate of a turbo code to the iterative decoder\nconvergence threshold, rather than to the turbo code distance spectrum.\nSubsequently, we compare the performance of various turbo codes in quasi-static\nfading channels. We show that, in contrast to the situation in the AWGN\nchannel, turbo codes with different interleaver sizes or turbo codes based on\nRSC codes with different constraint lengths and generator polynomials exhibit\nidentical performance. Moreover, we also compare the performance of turbo codes\nand convolutional codes in quasi-static fading channels under the condition of\nidentical decoding complexity. In particular, we show that turbo codes do not\noutperform convolutional codes in quasi-static fading channels with no antenna\ndiversity; and that turbo codes only outperform convolutional codes in\nquasi-static fading channels with antenna diversity."

    "summary": "This paper describes a new set of block source codes well suited for data\ncompression. These codes are defined by sets of productions rules of the form\na.l->b, where a in A represents a value from the source alphabet A and l, b are\n-small- sequences of bits. These codes naturally encompass other Variable\nLength Codes (VLCs) such as Huffman codes. It is shown that these codes may\nhave a similar or even a shorter mean description length than Huffman codes for\nthe same encoding and decoding complexity. A first code design method allowing\nto preserve the lexicographic order in the bit domain is described. The\ncorresponding codes have the same mean description length (mdl) as Huffman\ncodes from which they are constructed. Therefore, they outperform from a\ncompression point of view the Hu-Tucker codes designed to offer the\nlexicographic property in the bit domain. A second construction method allows\nto obtain codes such that the marginal bit probability converges to 0.5 as the\nsequence length increases and this is achieved even if the probability\ndistribution function is not known by the encoder."

    "summary": "The goal of a denoising algorithm is to reconstruct a signal from its\nnoise-corrupted observations. Perfect reconstruction is seldom possible and\nperformance is measured under a given fidelity criterion. In a recent work, the\nauthors addressed the problem of denoising unknown discrete signals corrupted\nby a discrete memoryless channel when the channel, rather than being completely\nknown, is only known to lie in some uncertainty set of possible channels. A\nsequence of denoisers was derived for this case and shown to be asymptotically\noptimal with respect to a worst-case criterion argued most relevant to this\nsetting. In the present work we address the implementation and complexity of\nthis denoiser for channels parametrized by a scalar, establishing its\npracticality. We show that for symmetric channels, the problem can be mapped\ninto a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We also\npresent empirical results suggesting the potential of these schemes to do well\nin practice. A key component of our schemes is an estimator of the subset of\nchannels in the uncertainty set that are feasible in the sense of being able to\ngive rise to the noise-corrupted signal statistics for some channel input\ndistribution. We establish the efficiency of this estimator, both\nalgorithmically and experimentally. We also present a modification of the\nrecently developed discrete universal denoiser (DUDE) that assumes a channel\nbased on the said estimator, and show that, in practice, the resulting scheme\nperforms well. For concreteness, we focus on the binary alphabet case and\nbinary symmetric channels, but also discuss the extensions of the algorithms to\ngeneral finite alphabets and to general channels parameterized by a scalar."

    "summary": "This paper considers the achievable rates and decoding complexity of\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over statistically independent parallel\nchannels. The paper starts with the derivation of bounds on the conditional\nentropy of the transmitted codeword given the received sequence at the output\nof the parallel channels; the component channels are considered to be\nmemoryless, binary-input, and output-symmetric (MBIOS). These results serve for\nthe derivation of an upper bound on the achievable rates of ensembles of LDPC\ncodes under optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding when their transmission\ntakes place over parallel MBIOS channels. The paper relies on the latter bound\nfor obtaining upper bounds on the achievable rates of ensembles of randomly and\nintentionally punctured LDPC codes over MBIOS channels. The paper also provides\na lower bound on the decoding complexity (per iteration) of ensembles of LDPC\ncodes under message-passing iterative decoding over parallel MBIOS channels;\nthe bound is given in terms of the gap between the rate of these codes for\nwhich reliable communication is achievable and the channel capacity. The paper\npresents a diagram which shows interconnections between the theorems introduced\nin this paper and some other previously reported results. The setting which\nserves for the derivation of the bounds on the achievable rates and decoding\ncomplexity is general, and the bounds can be applied to other scenarios which\ncan be treated as different forms of communication over parallel channels."

    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate achievable rates for data transmission from\nsources to sinks through multiple relay networks. We consider myopic coding, a\nconstrained communication strategy in which each node has only a local view of\nthe network, meaning that nodes can only transmit to and decode from\nneighboring nodes. We compare this with omniscient coding, in which every node\nhas a global view of the network and all nodes can cooperate. Using Gaussian\nchannels as examples, we find that when the nodes transmit at low power, the\nrates achievable with two-hop myopic coding are as large as that under\nomniscient coding in a five-node multiple relay channel and close to that under\nomniscient coding in a six-node multiple relay channel. These results suggest\nthat we may do local coding and cooperation without compromising much on the\ntransmission rate. Practically, myopic coding schemes are more robust to\ntopology changes because encoding and decoding at a node are not affected when\nthere are changes at remote nodes. Furthermore, myopic coding mitigates the\nhigh computational complexity and large buffer/memory requirements of\nomniscient coding."

By context-tree prediction, we\nrefer to a family of prediction schemes, where at each time instant $t$, after\nhaving observed all outcomes of the data sequence $x_1,...,x_{t-1}$, but not\nyet $x_t$, the prediction is based on a ``context'' (or a state) that consists\nof the $k$ most recent past outcomes $x_{t-k},...,x_{t-1}$, where the choice of\n$k$ may depend on the contents of a possibly longer, though limited, portion of\nthe observed past, $x_{t-k_{\\max}},...x_{t-1}$. This is different from the\nstudy reported in [1], where general finite-state predictors as well as\n``Markov'' (finite-memory) predictors of fixed order, were studied in the\nregime of individual sequences.\n  Another important difference between this study and [1] is the asymptotic\nregime. While in [1], the resources of the predictor (i.e., the number of\nstates or the memory size) were kept fixed regardless of the length $N$ of the\ndata sequence, here we investigate situations where the number of contexts or\nstates is allowed to grow concurrently with $N$. We are primarily interested in\nthe following fundamental question: What is the critical growth rate of the\nnumber of contexts, below which the performance of the best context-tree\npredictor is still universally achievable, but above which it is not? We show\nthat this critical growth rate is linear in $N$. In particular, we propose a\nuniversal context-tree algorithm that essentially achieves optimum performance\nas long as the growth rate is sublinear, and show that, on the other hand, this\nis impossible in the linear case."

    "summary": "In this work, we extend the non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF)\ncooperative diversity scheme to the MIMO channel. A family of space-time block\ncodes for a half-duplex MIMO NAF fading cooperative channel with N relays is\nconstructed. The code construction is based on the non-vanishing determinant\ncriterion (NVD) and is shown to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoff (DMT) of the channel. We provide a general explicit algebraic\nconstruction, followed by some examples. In particular, in the single relay\ncase, it is proved that the Golden code and the 4x4 Perfect code are optimal\nfor the single-antenna and two-antenna case, respectively. Simulation results\nreveal that a significant gain (up to 10dB) can be obtained with the proposed\ncodes, especially in the single-antenna case."

    "summary": "Density evolution is one of the most powerful analytical tools for\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and graph codes with message passing\ndecoding algorithms. With channel symmetry as one of its fundamental\nassumptions, density evolution (DE) has been widely and successfully applied to\ndifferent channels, including binary erasure channels, binary symmetric\nchannels, binary additive white Gaussian noise channels, etc. This paper\ngeneralizes density evolution for non-symmetric memoryless channels, which in\nturn broadens the applications to general memoryless channels, e.g. z-channels,\ncomposite white Gaussian noise channels, etc. The central theorem underpinning\nthis generalization is the convergence to perfect projection for any fixed size\nsupporting tree. A new iterative formula of the same complexity is then\npresented and the necessary theorems for the performance concentration theorems\nare developed. Several properties of the new density evolution method are\nexplored, including stability results for general asymmetric memoryless\nchannels. Simulations, code optimizations, and possible new applications\nsuggested by this new density evolution method are also provided. This result\nis also used to prove the typicality of linear LDPC codes among the coset code\nensemble when the minimum check node degree is sufficiently large. It is shown\nthat the convergence to perfect projection is essential to the belief\npropagation algorithm even when only symmetric channels are considered. Hence\nthe proof of the convergence to perfect projection serves also as a completion\nof the theory of classical density evolution for symmetric memoryless channels."

Channel uncertainty limits the\nachievable data rates of power constrained wide band systems; Duty cycle\ntransmission reduces the channel uncertainty because the receiver has to\nestimate the channel only when transmission takes place. The optimal choice of\nthe fraction of time used for transmission depends on the spectral efficiency\nof the signal modulation. The general principle is demonstrated by comparing\nthe channel conditions that allow different modulations to achieve the capacity\nin the limit. Direct sequence spread spectrum and pulse position modulation\nsystems with duty cycle achieve the channel capacity, if the increase of the\nnumber of channel paths with the bandwidth is not too rapid. The higher\nspectral efficiency of the spread spectrum modulation lets it achieve the\nchannel capacity in the limit, in environments where pulse position modulation\nwith non-vanishing symbol time cannot be used because of the large number of\nchannel paths."

    "summary": "The capacity of stationary additive Gaussian noise channels with feedback is\ncharacterized as the solution to a variational problem. Toward this end, it is\nproved that the optimal feedback coding scheme is stationary. When specialized\nto the first-order autoregressive moving-average noise spectrum, this\nvariational characterization yields a closed-form expression for the feedback\ncapacity. In particular, this result shows that the celebrated\nSchalkwijk--Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for the\nfirst-order autoregressive moving-average Gaussian channel, resolving a\nlong-standing open problem studied by Butman, Schalkwijk--Tiernan, Wolfowitz,\nOzarow, Ordentlich, Yang--Kavcic--Tatikonda, and others."

    "summary": "Optimal link adaption to the scattering function of wide sense stationary\nuncorrelated mobile communication channels is still an unsolved problem despite\nits importance for next-generation system design. In multicarrier transmission\nsuch link adaption is performed by pulse shaping, i.e. by properly adjusting\nthe transmit and receive filters. For example pulse shaped Offset--QAM systems\nhave been recently shown to have superior performance over standard cyclic\nprefix OFDM (while operating at higher spectral efficiency).In this paper we\nestablish a general mathematical framework for joint transmitter and receiver\npulse shape optimization for so-called Weyl--Heisenberg or Gabor signaling with\nrespect to the scattering function of the WSSUS channel. In our framework the\npulse shape optimization problem is translated to an optimization problem over\ntrace class operators which in turn is related to fidelity optimization in\nquantum information processing. By convexity relaxation the problem is shown to\nbe equivalent to a \\emph{convex constraint quasi-convex maximization problem}\nthereby revealing the non-convex nature of the overall WSSUS pulse design\nproblem. We present several iterative algorithms for optimization providing\napplicable results even for large--scale problem constellations. We show that\nwith transmitter-side knowledge of the channel statistics a gain of $3 - 6$dB\nin $\\SINR$ can be expected."

As a result there has been considerable interest in characterizing the\nergodic average of the mutual information for realistic correlated channels.\nHere, an approach is presented that provides analytic expressions not only for\nthe average, but also the higher cumulant moments of the distribution of the\nmutual information for zero-mean Gaussian (multiple-input multiple-output) MIMO\nchannels with the most general multipath covariance matrices when the channel\nis known at the receiver. These channels include multi-tap delay paths, as well\nas general channels with covariance matrices that cannot be written as a\nKronecker product, such as dual-polarized antenna arrays with general\ncorrelations at both transmitter and receiver ends. The mathematical methods\nare formally valid for large antenna numbers, in which limit it is shown that\nall higher cumulant moments of the distribution, other than the first two scale\nto zero. Thus, it is confirmed that the distribution of the mutual information\ntends to a Gaussian, which enables one to calculate the outage capacity.

We develop a\ngeneralized notion of SNR for the class of memoryless relay functions. The\nsolution to the generalized SNR optimization problem leads to the novel concept\nof minimum mean square uncorrelated error estimation(MMSUEE). For the elemental\ncase of a single relay, we show that MMSUEE is the SNR-optimal memoryless relay\nfunction regardless of the source and relay transmit power, and the modulation\nscheme. This scheme, that we call estimate and forward (EF), is also shown to\nbe SNR-optimal with PSK modulation in a parallel relay network. We demonstrate\nthat EF performs better than the best of amplify and forward (AF) and\ndemodulate and forward (DF), in both parallel and serial relay networks. We\nalso determine that AF is near-optimal at low transmit power in a parallel\nnetwork, while DF is near-optimal at high transmit power in a serial network.\nFor hybrid networks that contain both serial and parallel elements, and when\nrobust performance is desired, the advantage of EF over the best of AF and DF\nis found to be significant.

    "summary": "Optimal link adaption to the scattering function of wide sense stationary\nuncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) mobile communication channels is still an\nunsolved problem despite its importance for next-generation system design. In\nmulticarrier transmission such link adaption is performed by pulse shaping\nwhich in turn is equivalent to precoding with respect to the second order\nchannel statistics. In the present framework a translation of the precoder\noptimization problem into an optimization problem over trace class operators is\nused. This problem which is also well-known in the context of quantum\ninformation theory is unsolved in general due to its non-convex nature. However\nin very low dimension the problem formulation reveals an additional analytic\nstructure which again admits the solution to the optimal precoder and\nmultiplexing scheme. Hence, in this contribution the analytic solution of the\nproblem for the 2x2 doubly--dispersive WSSUS channel is presented."

    "summary": "In this paper we consider the computation of channel capacity for ergodic\nmultiple-input multiple-output channels with additive white Gaussian noise. Two\nscenarios are considered. Firstly, a time-varying channel is considered in\nwhich both the transmitter and the receiver have knowledge of the channel\nrealization. The optimal transmission strategy is water-filling over space and\ntime. It is shown that this may be achieved in a causal, indeed instantaneous\nfashion. In the second scenario, only the receiver has perfect knowledge of the\nchannel realization, while the transmitter has knowledge of the channel gain\nprobability law. In this case we determine an optimality condition on the input\ncovariance for ergodic Gaussian vector channels with arbitrary channel\ndistribution under the condition that the channel gains are independent of the\ntransmit signal. Using this optimality condition, we find an iterative\nalgorithm for numerical computation of optimal input covariance matrices.\nApplications to correlated Rayleigh and Ricean channels are given."

    "summary": "In an ultra wideband (UWB) impulse radio (IR) system, a number of pulses,\neach transmitted in an interval called a \"frame\", is employed to represent one\ninformation symbol. Conventionally, a single type of UWB pulse is used in all\nframes of all users. In this paper, IR systems with multiple types of UWB\npulses are considered, where different types of pulses can be used in different\nframes by different users. Both stored-reference (SR) and transmitted-reference\n(TR) systems are considered. First, the spectral properties of a multi-pulse IR\nsystem with polarity randomization is investigated. It is shown that the\naverage power spectral density is the average of the spectral contents of\ndifferent pulse shapes. Then, approximate closed-form expressions for the bit\nerror probability of a multi-pulse SR-IR system are derived for RAKE receivers\nin asynchronous multiuser environments. The effects of both inter-frame\ninterference (IFI) and multiple-access interference (MAI) are analyzed. The\ntheoretical and simulation results indicate that SR-IR systems that are more\nrobust against IFI and MAI than a \"conventional\" SR-IR system can be designed\nwith multiple types of ultra-wideband pulses. Finally, extensions to\nmulti-pulse TR-IR systems are briefly described."

    "summary": "Cooperative diversity has been recently proposed as a way to form virtual\nantenna arrays that provide dramatic gains in slow fading wireless\nenvironments. However most of the proposed solutions require distributed\nspace-time coding algorithms, the careful design of which is left for future\ninvestigation if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel\nscheme, that alleviates these problems and provides diversity gains on the\norder of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best\nrelay from a set of M available relays and then uses this best relay for\ncooperation between the source and the destination. We develop and analyze a\ndistributed method to select the best relay that requires no topology\ninformation and is based on local measurements of the instantaneous channel\nconditions. This method also requires no explicit communication among the\nrelays. The success (or failure) to select the best available path depends on\nthe statistics of the wireless channel, and a methodology to evaluate\nperformance for any kind of wireless channel statistics, is provided.\nInformation theoretic analysis of outage probability shows that our scheme\nachieves the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as achieved by more complex\nprotocols, where coordination and distributed space-time coding for M nodes is\nrequired, such as those proposed in [7]. The simplicity of the technique,\nallows for immediate implementation in existing radio hardware and its adoption\ncould provide for improved flexibility, reliability and efficiency in future 4G\nwireless systems."

First it is assumed that the receiver uses energy detection for the\nreception of OOFSK signals. Capacity expressions are obtained for the cases in\nwhich the receiver has perfect and imperfect fading side information. Power\nefficiency is investigated when the transmitter is subject to a peak-to-average\npower ratio (PAR) limitation or a peak power limitation. It is shown that under\na PAR limitation, it is extremely power inefficient to operate in the very low\nSNR regime. On the other hand, if there is only a peak power limitation, it is\ndemonstrated that power efficiency improves as one operates with smaller SNR\nand vanishing duty factor. Also studied are the capacity improvements that\naccrue when the receiver can track phase shifts in the channel or if the\nreceived signal has a specular component.

    "summary": "Mobile communication channels are often modeled as linear time-varying\nfilters or, equivalently, as time-frequency integral operators with finite\nsupport in time and frequency. Such a characterization inherently assumes the\nsignals are narrowband and may not be appropriate for wideband signals. In this\npaper time-scale characterizations are examined that are useful in wideband\ntime-varying channels, for which a time-scale integral operator is physically\njustifiable. A review of these time-frequency and time-scale characterizations\nis presented. Both the time-frequency and time-scale integral operators have a\ntwo-dimensional discrete characterization which motivates the design of\ntime-frequency or time-scale rake receivers. These receivers have taps for both\ntime and frequency (or time and scale) shifts of the transmitted signal. A\ngeneral theory of these characterizations which generates, as specific cases,\nthe discrete time-frequency and time-scale models is presented here. The\ninterpretation of these models, namely, that they can be seen to arise from\nprocessing assumptions on the transmit and receive waveforms is discussed. Out\nof this discussion a third model arises: a frequency-scale continuous channel\nmodel with an associated discrete frequency-scale characterization."

Using this common form we find that for the\nsingle user channel, the multiple access channel, the degraded broadcast\nchannel, and the degraded relay channel, the sum capacity with causal and\nnon-causal side information are identical when all the transmitter side\ninformation is also made available to all the receivers. A genie-aided\nouterbound is developed that states that when a genie provides $n$ bits of side\ninformation to a receiver the resulting capacity improvement can not be more\nthan $n$ bits. Combining these two results we are able to bound the relative\ncapacity advantage of non-causal side information over causal side information\nfor both single user as well as various multiple user communication scenarios.\nApplications of these capacity bounds are demonstrated through examples of\nrandom access channels. Interestingly, the capacity results indicate that the\nexcessive MAC layer overheads common in present wireless systems may be avoided\nthrough coding across multiple access blocks. It is also shown that even one\nbit of side information at the transmitter can result in unbounded capacity\nimprovement. As a side, we obtain the sum capacity for a multiple access\nchannel when the side information available to the transmitter is causal and\npossibly correlated to the side information available to the receiver."

An area theorem for transmission over general memoryless channels\nis introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed. We show that\nthis area theorem gives rise to an upper-bound on the maximum a posteriori\nthreshold for sparse graph codes. In situations where this bound is tight, the\nextrinsic soft bit estimates delivered by the belief propagation decoder\ncoincide with the correct a posteriori probabilities above the maximum a\nposteriori threshold. More generally, it is conjectured that the fundamental\nrelationship between the maximum a posteriori and the belief propagation\ndecoder which was observed for transmission over the binary erasure channel\ncarries over to the general case.

    "summary": "We consider a model for secrecy generation, with three terminals, by means of\npublic interterminal communication, and examine the problem of characterizing\nall the rates at which all three terminals can generate a ``secret key,'' and\n-- simultaneously -- two designated terminals can generate a ``private key''\nwhich is effectively concealed from the remaining terminal; both keys are also\nconcealed from an eavesdropper that observes the public communication. Inner\nand outer bounds for the ``secret key--private key capacity region'' are\nderived. Under a certain special condition, these bounds coincide to yield the\n(exact) secret key--private key capacity region."

Unlike the lossless network coding problem, lossy\nreconstruction of the source at the sinks is permitted. We make a first attempt\nto characterize the set of all distortions achievable by a set of sinks in a\ngiven network. While the entire region of all achievable distortions remains\nlargely an open problem, we find a large, non-trivial subset of it using ideas\nin multiple description coding.

    "summary": "A wideband fading channel is considered with causal channel state information\n(CSI) at the transmitter and no receiver CSI. A simple orthogonal code with\nenergy detection rule at the receiver (similar to [6]) is shown to achieve the\ncapacity of this channel in the limit of large bandwidth. This code transmits\nenergy only when the channel gain is large enough. In this limit, this capacity\nwithout any receiver CSI is the same as the capacity with full receiver CSI--a\nphenomenon also true for dirty paper coding. For Rayleigh fading, this capacity\n(per unit time) is proportional to the logarithm of the bandwidth. Our coding\nscheme is motivated from the Gel'fand-Pinsker [2,3] coding and dirty paper\ncoding [4]. Nonetheless, for our case, only causal CSI is required at the\ntransmitter in contrast with dirty-paper coding and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding,\nwhere non-causal CSI is required.\n  Then we consider a general discrete channel with i.i.d. states. Each input\nhas an associated cost and a zero cost input \"0\" exists. The channel state is\nassumed be to be known at the transmitter in a causal manner. Capacity per unit\ncost is found for this channel and a simple orthogonal code is shown to achieve\nthis capacity. Later, a novel orthogonal coding scheme is proposed for the case\nof causal transmitter CSI and a condition for equivalence of capacity per unit\ncost for causal and non-causal transmitter CSI is derived. Finally, some\nconnections are made to the case of non-causal transmitter CSI in [8]."

When the interference is\nlarge and independent across the users, we show that time sharing is optimal.\n  For the Gaussian case we present a coding scheme and establish its optimality\nin the high signal-to-interference-plus-noise limit when there are two\nreceivers.

This result sheds a new light on the opportunistic\ncommunication principle and argues for the fairness of the sum-rate optimal\npoint, at least from a game theoretic perspective. The base-station is then\nintroduced as a player interested in maximizing a weighted sum of the\nindividual rates. We propose a Stackelberg formulation in which the\nbase-station is the designated game leader. In this set-up, the base-station\nannounces first its strategy defined as the decoding order of the different\nusers, in the successive cancellation receiver, as a function of the channel\nstate. In the second stage, the users compete conditioned on this particular\ndecoding strategy. We show that this formulation allows for achieving all the\ncorner points of the capacity region, in addition to the sum-rate optimal\npoint. On the negative side, we prove the non-existence of a base-station\nstrategy in this formulation that achieves the rest of the boundary points. To\novercome this limitation, we present a repeated game approach which achieves\nthe capacity region of the fading multiple access channel.

The multi-dimensional nature of users' strategies and the\nnon-quasiconcavity of the utility function make the multi-carrier problem much\nmore challenging than the single-carrier or throughput-based-utility case. It\nis shown that, for all linear receivers including the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, and the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, a user's\nutility is maximized when the user transmits only on its \"best\" carrier. This\nis the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular\ntarget signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the\nreceiver. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed\npower control game are studied. In particular, conditions are given that must\nbe satisfied by the channel gains for a Nash equilibrium to exist, and the\ndistribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is also\ncharacterized. In addition, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching\nthe equilibrium (when it exists) is presented. It is shown that the proposed\napproach results in significant improvements in the total utility achieved at\nequilibrium compared to a single-carrier system and also to a multi-carrier\nsystem in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier\nindependently."

    "summary": "Performance of reliable communication over a coherent slow fading channel at\nhigh SNR is succinctly captured as a fundamental tradeoff between diversity and\nmultiplexing gains. We study the problem of designing codes that optimally\ntradeoff the diversity and multiplexing gains. Our main contribution is a\nprecise characterization of codes that are universally tradeoff-optimal, i.e.,\nthey optimally tradeoff the diversity and multiplexing gains for every\nstatistical characterization of the fading channel. We denote this\ncharacterization as one of approximate universality where the approximation is\nin the connection between error probability and outage capacity with diversity\nand multiplexing gains, respectively. The characterization of approximate\nuniversality is then used to construct new coding schemes as well as to show\noptimality of several schemes proposed in the space-time coding literature."

    "summary": "This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we develop a new\ninformation theory, in which it is not a coincidence that information and\nphysical entropy share the same mathematical formula. It is an adaptation of\nmind to help search for resources. We then show that psychological patterns\neither reflect the constraints of physical laws or are evolutionary adaptations\nto efficiently process information and to increase the chance of survival in\nthe environment of our evolutionary past. In the second part, we demonstrate\nthat the new information theory provides the foundation to understand market\nbehavior. One fundamental result from the information theory is that\ninformation is costly. In general, information with higher value is more\ncostly. Another fundamental result from the information theory is that the\namount of information one can receive is the amount of information generated\nminus equivocation. The level of equivocation, which is the measure of\ninformation asymmetry, is determined by the correlation between the source of\ninformation and the receiver of information. In general, how much information\none can receive depends on the background knowledge of the receiver. The\ndifference in cost different investors are willing to pay for information and\nthe difference in background knowledge about a particular information causes\nthe heterogeneity in information processing by the investment public, which is\nthe main reason of the price and volume patterns observed in the market. Many\nassumptions in some of the recent models on behavioral finance can be derived\nnaturally from this theory."

We derive linear\nspatial precoding schemes for both coherent (channel is known at the receiver)\nand non-coherent (channel is un-known at the receiver) space-time coded MIMO\nsystems. Antenna spacing and antenna placement (geometry) are considered as\nfixed parameters of MIMO channels, which are readily known at the transmitter.\nThese precoding schemes exploit the antenna placement information at both ends\nof the MIMO channel to ameliorate the effect of non-ideal antenna placement on\nthe performance of space-time coded systems. In these schemes, the precoder is\nfixed for given transmit and receive antenna configurations and transmitter\ndoes not require any feedback of channel state information (partial or full)\nfrom the receiver. Closed form solutions for both precoding schemes are\npresented for systems with up to three receiver antennas. A generalized method\nis proposed for more than three receiver antennas. We use the coherent\nspace-time block codes (STBC) and differential space-time block codes to\nanalyze the performance of proposed precoding schemes. Simulation results show\nthat at low SNRs, both precoders give significant performance improvement over\na non-precoded system for small antenna aperture sizes."

To this end we introduce the concept of graph-cover\ndecoding. Whereas in maximum-likelihood decoding all codewords in a code are\ncompeting to be the best explanation of the received vector, under graph-cover\ndecoding all codewords in all finite covers of a Tanner graph representation of\nthe code are competing to be the best explanation. We are interested in\ngraph-cover decoding because it is a theoretical tool that can be used to show\nconnections between linear programming decoding and message-passing iterative\ndecoding. Namely, on the one hand it turns out that graph-cover decoding is\nessentially equivalent to linear programming decoding. On the other hand,\nbecause iterative, locally operating decoding algorithms like message-passing\niterative decoding cannot distinguish the underlying Tanner graph from any\ncovering graph, graph-cover decoding can serve as a model to explain the\nbehavior of message-passing iterative decoding. Understanding the behavior of\ngraph-cover decoding is tantamount to understanding the so-called fundamental\npolytope. Therefore, we give some characterizations of this polytope and\nexplain its relation to earlier concepts that were introduced to understand the\nbehavior of message-passing iterative decoding for finite-length codes."

    "summary": "Gaussian channels with memory and with noiseless feedback have been widely\nstudied in the information theory literature. However, a coding scheme to\nachieve the feedback capacity is not available. In this paper, a coding scheme\nis proposed to achieve the feedback capacity for Gaussian channels. The coding\nscheme essentially implements the celebrated Kalman filter algorithm, and is\nequivalent to an estimation system over the same channel without feedback. It\nreveals that the achievable information rate of the feedback communication\nsystem can be alternatively given by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound of\nthe associated estimation system. Thus, combined with the control theoretic\ncharacterizations of feedback communication (proposed by Elia), this implies\nthat the fundamental limitations in feedback communication, estimation, and\ncontrol coincide. This leads to a unifying perspective that integrates\ninformation, estimation, and control. We also establish the optimality of the\nKalman filtering in the sense of information transmission, a supplement to the\noptimality of Kalman filtering in the sense of information processing proposed\nby Mitter and Newton. In addition, the proposed coding scheme generalizes the\nSchalkwijk-Kailath codes and reduces the coding complexity and coding delay.\nThe construction of the coding scheme amounts to solving a finite-dimensional\noptimization problem. A simplification to the optimal stationary input\ndistribution developed by Yang, Kavcic, and Tatikonda is also obtained. The\nresults are verified in a numerical example."

The required rate is given by the log of\nthe unstable system gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of\nstability desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential\ngeneralization of the Schalkwijk/Kailath scheme for communication over the AWGN\nchannel with feedback.\n  In cases of sufficiently rich information patterns between the encoder and\ndecoder, adequate anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to\nexist a stabilizing controller.

    "summary": "We provide a tight approximate characterization of the $n$-dimensional\nproduct multicommodity flow (PMF) region for a wireless network of $n$ nodes.\nSeparate characterizations in terms of the spectral properties of appropriate\nnetwork graphs are obtained in both an information theoretic sense and for a\ncombinatorial interference model (e.g., Protocol model). These provide an inner\napproximation to the $n^2$ dimensional capacity region. These results answer\nthe following questions which arise naturally from previous work: (a) What is\nthe significance of $1/\\sqrt{n}$ in the scaling laws for the Protocol\ninterference model obtained by Gupta and Kumar (2000)? (b) Can we obtain a\ntight approximation to the \"maximum supportable flow\" for node distributions\nmore general than the geometric random distribution, traffic models other than\nrandomly chosen source-destination pairs, and under very general assumptions on\nthe channel fading model?\n  We first establish that the random source-destination model is essentially a\none-dimensional approximation to the capacity region, and a special case of\nproduct multi-commodity flow. Building on previous results, for a combinatorial\ninterference model given by a network and a conflict graph, we relate the\nproduct multicommodity flow to the spectral properties of the underlying graphs\nresulting in computational upper and lower bounds. For the more interesting\nrandom fading model with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), we show that the\nscaling laws for PMF can again be tightly characterized by the spectral\nproperties of appropriately defined graphs. As an implication, we obtain\ncomputationally efficient upper and lower bounds on the PMF for any wireless\nnetwork with a guaranteed approximation factor."

The maximal number of $n$-bit\nsequences whose pairwise differences do not contain some given forbidden\ndifference patterns increases exponentially with $n$. The exponent is the\ncapacity of the forbidden patterns, which is given by the logarithm of the\njoint spectral radius of a set of matrices constructed from the forbidden\ndifference patterns. We provide a new family of bounds that allows for the\napproximation, in exponential time, of the capacity with arbitrary high degree\nof accuracy. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of\ndetermining if the capacity of a set is positive, but we prove that the same\nproblem becomes NP-hard when the sets of forbidden patterns are defined over an\nextended set of symbols. Finally, we prove the existence of extremal norms for\nthe sets of matrices arising in the capacity computation. This result makes it\npossible to apply a specific (even though non polynomial) approximation\nalgorithm. We illustrate this fact by computing exactly the capacity of codes\nthat were only known approximately."

Data compression offers an\nattractive approach to reducing communication costs by using available\nbandwidth effectively. Over the last decade there has been an unprecedented\nexplosion in the amount of digital data transmitted via the Internet,\nrepresenting text, images, video, sound, computer programs, etc. With this\ntrend expected to continue, it makes sense to pursue research on developing\nalgorithms that can most effectively use available network bandwidth by\nmaximally compressing data. This research paper is focused on addressing this\nproblem of lossless compression of text files. Lossless compression researchers\nhave developed highly sophisticated approaches, such as Huffman encoding,\narithmetic encoding, the Lempel-Ziv family, Dynamic Markov Compression (DMC),\nPrediction by Partial Matching (PPM), and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based\nalgorithms. However, none of these methods has been able to reach the\ntheoretical best-case compression ratio consistently, which suggests that\nbetter algorithms may be possible. One approach for trying to attain better\ncompression ratios is to develop new compression algorithms. An alternative\napproach, however, is to develop intelligent, reversible transformations that\ncan be applied to a source text that improve an existing, or backend,\nalgorithm's ability to compress.

In this\npaper, we make a first step in studying this method, and show that it can\nsignificantly reduce the complexity of the problem, which was originally\nexponential in the maximum check-node degree. We further show that adaptively\nadding new constraints, e.g. by combining parity checks, can provide large\ngains in the performance."

We assume that the jammer can eavesdrop the channel and can use the\ninformation obtained to perform correlated jamming. Under various assumptions\non the channel characteristics, and the extent of information available at the\nusers and the jammer, we show the existence, or otherwise non-existence of a\nsimultaneously optimal set of strategies for the users and the jammer. In all\nthe cases where the channel is non-fading, we show that the game has a\nsolution, and the optimal strategies are Gaussian signalling for the users and\nlinear jamming for the jammer. In fading channels, we envision each player's\nstrategy as a power allocation function over the channel states, together with\nthe signalling strategies at each channel state. We reduce the game solution to\na set of power allocation functions for the players and show that when the\njammer is uncorrelated, the game has a solution, but when the jammer is\ncorrelated, a set of simultaneously optimal power allocation functions for the\nusers and the jammer does not always exist. In this case, we characterize the\nmax-min user power allocation strategies and the corresponding jammer power\nallocation strategy."

Even one-bit of information can increase the\ndiversity order of the system compared to the system with no transmitter\ninformation. In addition, as the amount of channel information at the\ntransmitter increases, the diversity order for each multiplexing gain increases\nand goes to infinity for perfect transmitter information.

The IBP interleavers reduce the above-mentioned correlation and increase\nthe effective interleaving size. The increased effective interleaving size\nimproves the distance spectrum while the reduced covariance enhances the\niterative decoder's performance. Moreover, the structure of the\nIBP(-interleaved) turbo codes (IBPTC) is naturally fit for high rate\napplications that necessitate parallel decoding.\n  We present some useful bounds and constraints associated with the IBPTC that\ncan be used as design guidelines. The corresponding codeword weight upper\nbounds for weight-2 and weight-4 input sequences are derived. Based on some of\nthe design guidelines, we propose a simple IBP algorithm and show that the\nassociated IBPTC yields 0.3 to 1.2 dB performance gain, or equivalently, an\nIBPTC renders the same performance with a much reduced interleaving delay.

This\ntradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=\nn_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and\nn_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <\nn_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.\n  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly\nconstructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff\nfor any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square\nminimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes\nhaving the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal. While\nconstructions of such codes were previously known for restricted values of n,\nwe provide here a construction for such codes that is valid for all n.\n  For the rectangular, T > n_t case, we present two general techniques for\nbuilding D-MG-optimal rectangular ST codes from their square counterparts. A\nbyproduct of our results establishes that the D-MG tradeoff for all T>= n_t is\nthe same as that previously known to hold for T >= n_t + n_r -1."

To exploit the spatial diversity benefit we propose a\ncluster-based collaborating strategy for a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel\nmodel and based on a network geometric distance profile.

The transmitted message is encoded using a mother code and\npartitioned into M blocks corresponding to the each of M slots. In the first\nslot, the (hop) sender broadcasts its information by transmitting the first\nblock, and its helpers attempt to relay this message. In the remaining slots,\nthe each of left-over M-1 blocks is sent either through a helper which has\nsuccessfully decoded the message or directly by the (hop) sender where a\ndynamic schedule is based on the ACK-based feedback from the cluster. By\nemploying powerful good codes (e.g., turbo codes, LDPC codes, and raptor codes)\nwhose performance is characterized by a threshold behavior, our approach\nimproves the reliability of a multi-hop routing through not only cooperation\ndiversity benefit but also a coding advantage. The study of the diversity and\nthe coding gain of the proposed scheme is based on a new simple threshold bound\non the frame-error rate (FER) of maximum likelihood decoding. A average FER\nupper bound and its asymptotic (in large SNR) version are derived as a function\nof the average fading channel SNRs and the code threshold."

    "summary": "Gossip algorithms for aggregation have recently received significant\nattention for sensor network applications because of their simplicity and\nrobustness in noisy and uncertain environments. However, gossip algorithms can\nwaste significant energy by essentially passing around redundant information\nmultiple times. For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and\nrandom geometric graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is caused by slow\nmixing times of random walks on those graphs. We propose and analyze an\nalternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing\na simple resampling method, we can demonstrate substantial gains over\npreviously proposed gossip protocols. In particular, for random geometric\ngraphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy $1/n^a$ using\n$O(n^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\log n})$ radio transmissions, which reduces the energy\nconsumption by a $\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{\\log n}}$ factor over standard gossip\nalgorithms."

    "summary": "This paper is devoted to the finite-length analysis of turbo decoding over\nthe binary erasure channel (BEC). The performance of iterative\nbelief-propagation (BP) decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over\nthe BEC can be characterized in terms of stopping sets. We describe turbo\ndecoding on the BEC which is simpler than turbo decoding on other channels. We\nthen adapt the concept of stopping sets to turbo decoding and state an exact\ncondition for decoding failure. Apply turbo decoding until the transmitted\ncodeword has been recovered, or the decoder fails to progress further. Then the\nset of erased positions that will remain when the decoder stops is equal to the\nunique maximum-size turbo stopping set which is also a subset of the set of\nerased positions. Furthermore, we present some improvements of the basic turbo\ndecoding algorithm on the BEC. The proposed improved turbo decoding algorithm\nhas substantially better error performance as illustrated by the given\nsimulation results. Finally, we give an expression for the turbo stopping set\nsize enumerating function under the uniform interleaver assumption, and an\nefficient enumeration algorithm of small-size turbo stopping sets for a\nparticular interleaver. The solution is based on the algorithm proposed by\nGarello et al. in 2001 to compute an exhaustive list of all low-weight\ncodewords in a turbo code."

The iterative message-passing algorithm\nis a widely adopted decoding algorithm for LDPC codes \\cite{Kschischang01}. An\nimportant design issue for LDPC codes is designing codes with fast decoding\nspeed while maintaining capacity-approaching performance. In another words, it\nis desirable that the code can be successfully decoded in few number of\ndecoding iterations, at the same time, achieves a significant portion of the\nchannel capacity. Despite of its importance, this design issue received little\nattention so far. In this paper, we address this design issue for the case of\nbinary erasure channel.\n  We prove that density-efficient capacity-approaching LDPC codes satisfy a so\ncalled \"flatness condition\". We show an asymptotic approximation to the number\nof decoding iterations. Based on these facts, we propose an approximated\noptimization approach to finding the codes with good decoding speed.

Toward this end, it is\nproved that the optimal feedback coding scheme is stationary. When specialized\nto the first-order autoregressive moving average noise spectrum, this\nvariational characterization yields a closed-form expression for the feedback\ncapacity. In particular, this result shows that the celebrated\nSchalkwijk-Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for the\nfirst-order autoregressive moving average Gaussian channel, positively\nanswering a long-standing open problem studied by Butman, Schalkwijk-Tiernan,\nWolfowitz, Ozarow, Ordentlich, Yang-Kavcic-Tatikonda, and others. More\ngenerally, it is shown that a k-dimensional generalization of the\nSchalkwijk-Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for any\nautoregressive moving average noise spectrum of order k.

We demonstrate that source-channel (or source-network)\nseparation holds for several canonical network examples like the noisy multiple\naccess channel and the erasure degraded broadcast channel, when the whole\nnetwork operates over a common finite field. This robustness of separation is\npredicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent, and we examine\nthe failure of separation when noise is dependent on inputs in multiple access\nchannels.\n  Our approach is based on the sufficiency of linear codes. Using a simple and\nunifying framework, we not only re-establish with economy the optimality of\nlinear codes for single-transmitter, single-receiver channels and for\nSlepian-Wolf source coding, but also establish the optimality of linear codes\nfor multiple access and for erasure degraded broadcast channels. The linearity\nallows us to obtain simple optimal code constructions and to study capacity\nregions of the noisy multiple access and the degraded broadcast channel. The\nlinearity of both source and network coding blurs the delineation between\nsource and network codes. While our results point to the fact that separation\nof source coding and channel coding is optimal in some canonical networks, we\nshow that decomposing networks into canonical subnetworks may not be effective.\nThus, we argue that it may be the lack of decomposability of a network into\ncanonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source\nand channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding over networks."

    "summary": "It is well known that Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have high\nspectral efficiency, especially when channel state information at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) is available. When CSIT is obtained by feedback, it is\npractical to assume that the channel state feedback rate is finite and the CSIT\nis not perfect. For such a system, we consider beamforming and power on/off\nstrategy for its simplicity and near optimality, where power on/off means that\na beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on with a constant power or turned\noff. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately evaluate the\ninformation rate as a function of the channel state feedback rate. Name a beam\nturned on as an on-beam and the minimum number of the transmit and receive\nantennas as the dimension of a MIMO system. We prove that the ratio of the\noptimal number of on-beams and the system dimension converges to a constant for\na given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the numbers of transmit and receive\nantennas approach infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect.\nAsymptotic formulas are derived to evaluate this ratio and the corresponding\ninformation rate per dimension. The asymptotic results can be accurately\napplied to finite dimensional systems and suggest a power on/off strategy with\na constant number of on-beams. For this suboptimal strategy, we take a novel\napproach to introduce power efficiency factor, which is a function of the\nfeedback rate, to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. By combining\npower efficiency factor and the asymptotic formulas for perfect beamforming\ncase, the information rate of the power on/off strategy with a constant number\nof on-beams is accurately characterized."

    "summary": "Multiple transmit antennas in a downlink channel can provide tremendous\ncapacity (i.e. multiplexing) gains, even when receivers have only single\nantennas. However, receiver and transmitter channel state information is\ngenerally required. In this paper, a system where each receiver has perfect\nchannel knowledge, but the transmitter only receives quantized information\nregarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well known zero forcing\ntransmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput\ndegradation due to finite rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the\nfeedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the SNR (in dB) in\norder to achieve the full multiplexing gain, which is in sharp contrast to\npoint-to-point MIMO systems in which it is not necessary to increase the\nfeedback rate as a function of the SNR."

    "summary": "A multiple antenna broadcast channel with perfect channel state information\nat the receivers is considered. If each receiver quantizes its channel\nknowledge to a finite number of bits which are fed back to the transmitter, the\nlarge capacity benefits of the downlink channel can be realized. However, the\nrequired number of feedback bits per mobile must be scaled with both the number\nof transmit antennas and the system SNR, and thus can be quite large in even\nmoderately sized systems. It is shown that a small number of antennas can be\nused at each receiver to improve the quality of the channel estimate provided\nto the transmitter. As a result, the required feedback rate per mobile can be\nsignificantly decreased."

    "summary": "Universal compression of patterns of sequences generated by independently\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) sources with unknown, possibly large,\nalphabets is investigated. A pattern is a sequence of indices that contains all\nconsecutive indices in increasing order of first occurrence. If the alphabet of\na source that generated a sequence is unknown, the inevitable cost of coding\nthe unknown alphabet symbols can be exploited to create the pattern of the\nsequence. This pattern can in turn be compressed by itself. It is shown that if\nthe alphabet size $k$ is essentially small, then the average minimax and\nmaximin redundancies as well as the redundancy of every code for almost every\nsource, when compressing a pattern, consist of at least 0.5 log(n/k^3) bits per\neach unknown probability parameter, and if all alphabet letters are likely to\noccur, there exist codes whose redundancy is at most 0.5 log(n/k^2) bits per\neach unknown probability parameter, where n is the length of the data\nsequences. Otherwise, if the alphabet is large, these redundancies are\nessentially at least O(n^{-2/3}) bits per symbol, and there exist codes that\nachieve redundancy of essentially O(n^{-1/2}) bits per symbol. Two sub-optimal\nlow-complexity sequential algorithms for compression of patterns are presented\nand their description lengths analyzed, also pointing out that the pattern\naverage universal description length can decrease below the underlying i.i.d.\\\nentropy for large enough alphabets."

A network of wireless sensors that seek to cooperatively\ntransmit a common message signal to a Base Station (BS) is considered. In this\ncase, it is well-known that substantial energy efficiencies are possible by\nusing distributed beamforming. The feedback algorithm is shown to achieve the\ncarrier phase coherence required for beamforming in a scalable and distributed\nmanner. In the proposed algorithm, each sensor independently makes a random\nadjustment to its carrier phase. Assuming that the BS is able to broadcast one\nbit of feedback each timeslot about the change in received signal to noise\nratio (SNR), the sensors are able to keep the favorable phase adjustments and\ndiscard the unfavorable ones, asymptotically achieving perfect phase coherence.\nA novel analytical model is derived that accurately predicts the convergence\nrate.

    "summary": "Conventional turbo codes (CTCs) usually employ a block-oriented interleaving\nso that each block is separately encoded and decoded. As interleaving and\nde-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process\nassociated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the\ncorresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a\nspecial interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test\ninvolving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is\nnaturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding\nsystem offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs.\nIn particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient\ninter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained\nfrom termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes\nimportant to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved\nperformance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required\ncomputing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a\ncritical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff\nbetween performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a\nmodular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance\ndue not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the\ninterleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of\nparallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits\na variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and\nperformance demands."

The current state of the art\nin MIMO detection is list decoding and lattice decoding. This paper proposes a\nnew class of lattice detectors that combines some of the principles of both\nlist and lattice decoding, thus resulting in an efficient parallelizable\nimplementation and near optimal soft-ouput ML performance. The novel detector\nis called layered orthogonal lattice detector (LORD), because it adopts a new\nlattice formulation and relies on a channel orthogonalization process. It\nshould be noted that the algorithm achieves optimal hard-output ML performance\nin case of two transmit antennas. For two transmit antennas max-log bit\nsoft-output information can be generated and for greater than two antennas\napproximate max-log detection is achieved. Simulation results show that LORD,\nin MIMO system employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and\nbit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is able to achieve very high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains compared to practical soft-output detectors\nsuch as minimum-mean square error (MMSE), in either linear or nonlinear\niterative scheme.

We also show\nthat for a given fiber capacity, there is an optimal operating wireless\nbandwidth and an optimal number of wireless-optical interfaces. The\nwireless-optical interfaces of our scheme have low complexity and do not\nrequire knowledge of the transmitter code book.

In fact, all\npreviously proposed amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)\nschemes do not improve with the number of relays in terms of the diversity\nmultiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for multiplexing gains r higher than 0.5. In this\nwork, we study the class of slotted amplify-and-forward (SAF) schemes. We first\nestablish an upper bound on the DMT for any SAF scheme with an arbitrary number\nof relays N and number of slots M. Then, we propose a sequential SAF scheme\nthat can exploit the potential diversity gain in the high multiplexing gain\nregime. More precisely, in certain conditions, the sequential SAF scheme\nachieves the proposed DMT upper bound which tends to the transmit diversity\nbound when M goes to infinity. In particular, for the two-relay case, the\nthree-slot sequential SAF scheme achieves the proposed upper bound and\noutperforms the two-relay non-orthorgonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) scheme of\nAzarian et al. for multiplexing gains r < 2/3. Numerical results reveal a\nsignificant gain of our scheme over the previously proposed AF schemes,\nespecially in high spectral efficiency and large network size regime."

    "summary": "This paper is concerned with the scaling of the number of hops in a large\nscale wireless ad-hoc network (WANET), a quantity we call network latency. A\nlarge network latency affects all aspects of data communication in a WANET,\nincluding an increase in delay, packet loss, required processing power and\nmemory. We consider network management and data routing challenges in WANETs\nwith scalable network latency. On the physical side, reducing network latency\nimposes a significantly higher power and bandwidth demand on nodes, as is\nreflected in a set of new bounds. On the protocol front, designing distributed\nrouting protocols that can guarantee the delivery of data packets within\nscalable number of hops is a challenging task. To solve this, we introduce\nmulti-resolution randomized hierarchy (MRRH), a novel power and bandwidth\nefficient WANET protocol with scalable network latency. MRRH uses a randomized\nalgorithm for building and maintaining a random hierarchical network topology,\nwhich together with the proposed routing algorithm can guarantee efficient\ndelivery of data packets in the wireless network. For a network of size $N$,\nMRRH can provide an average latency of only $O(\\log^{3} N)$. The power and\nbandwidth consumption of MRRH are shown to be \\emph{nearly} optimal for the\nlatency it provides. Therefore, MRRH, is a provably efficient candidate for\ntruly large scale wireless ad-hoc networking."

A connection is\ndemonstrated between the asymptotic behavior of channel capacity in this regime\nand the asymptotic behavior of the prediction error incurred in predicting the\nfading process from very noisy observations of its past. This connection can be\nviewed as the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analog of recent results by\nLapidoth & Moser and by Lapidoth demonstrating connections between the high SNR\ncapacity growth and the noiseless or almost-noiseless prediction error. We\ndistinguish between two families of fading laws: the ``slowly forgetting'' and\nthe ``quickly forgetting''. For channels in the former category the low SNR\ncapacity is achieved by IID inputs, whereas in the latter such inputs are\ntypically sub-optimal. Instead, the asymptotic capacity can be approached by\ninputs with IID phase but block-constant magnitude."

Together, these\nbounds allow us to identify the exact scaling of channel capacity for a fixed\npeak to average ratio, as the average power converges to zero. The upper bound\nis also asymptotically tight as the average power converges to zero for a fixed\npeak power.\n  For a continuous time infinite bandwidth channel, Viterbi identified the\ncapacity for M-FSK modulation.

    "summary": "We address the problem of delay in an arithmetic coding system. Due to the\nnature of the arithmetic coding process, source sequences causing arbitrarily\nlarge encoding or decoding delays exist. This phenomena raises the question of\njust how large is the expected input to output delay in these systems, i.e.,\nonce a source sequence has been encoded, what is the expected number of source\nletters that should be further encoded to allow full decoding of that sequence.\nIn this paper, we derive several new upper bounds on the expected delay for a\nmemoryless source, which improve upon a known bound due to Gallager. The bounds\nprovided are uniform in the sense of being independent of the sequence's\nhistory. In addition, we give a sufficient condition for a source to admit a\nbounded expected delay, which holds for a stationary ergodic Markov source of\nany order."

The key feature of a cognitive radio is its ability\nto recognize the primary (licensed) user and adapt its communication strategy\nto minimize the interference that it generates. We consider a communication\nscenario in which the primary and the cognitive user wish to communicate to\ndifferent receivers, subject to mutual interference. Modeling the cognitive\nradio as a transmitter with side-information about the primary transmission, we\ncharacterize the largest rate at which the cognitive radio can reliably\ncommunicate under the constraint that (i) no interference is created for the\nprimary user, and (ii) the primary encoder-decoder pair is oblivious to the\npresence of the cognitive radio."

Necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a source to be successively refinable along a distortion vector are\nsubsequently derived. A source-channel separation theorem is provided when the\ndescriptions are sent over independent channels for the multistage case.\nFurthermore, we introduce the notion of generalized successive refinability\nwith multiple degraded side informations. This notion captures whether\nprogressive encoding to satisfy multiple distortion constraints for different\nside informations is as good as encoding without progressive requirement.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for generalized successive refinability are\ngiven. It is shown that the following two sources are generalized successively\nrefinable: (1) the Gaussian source with degraded Gaussian side informations,\n(2) the doubly symmetric binary source when the worse side information is a\nconstant. Thus for both cases, the failure of being successively refinable is\nonly due to the inherent uncertainty on which side information will occur at\nthe decoder, but not the progressive encoding requirement."

    "summary": "Motivated by the problem of reducing the peak to average power ratio (PAPR)\nof transmitted signals, we consider a design of complementary set matrices\nwhose column sequences satisfy a correlation constraint. The design algorithm\nrecursively builds a collection of $2^{t+1}$ mutually orthogonal (MO)\ncomplementary set matrices starting from a companion pair of sequences. We\nrelate correlation properties of column sequences to that of the companion pair\nand illustrate how to select an appropriate companion pair to ensure that a\ngiven column correlation constraint is satisfied. For $t=0$, companion pair\nproperties directly determine matrix column correlation properties. For $t\\geq\n1$, reducing correlation merits of the companion pair may lead to improved\ncolumn correlation properties. However, further decrease of the maximum\nout-off-phase aperiodic autocorrelation of column sequences is not possible\nonce the companion pair correlation merit is less than a threshold determined\nby $t$. We also reveal a design of the companion pair which leads to\ncomplementary set matrices with Golay column sequences. Exhaustive search for\ncompanion pairs satisfying a column correlation constraint is infeasible for\nmedium and long sequences. We instead search for two shorter length sequences\nby minimizing a cost function in terms of their autocorrelation and\ncrosscorrelation merits. Furthermore, an improved cost function which helps in\nreducing the maximum out-off-phase column correlation is derived based on the\nproperties of the companion pair. By exploiting the well-known Welch bound,\nsufficient conditions for the existence of companion pairs which satisfy a set\nof column correlation constraints are also given."

However, each user views the other\nuser as a wire-tapper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as\nsecret as possible from the other user. The level of secrecy of the\nconfidential information is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the\nentropy rate of the confidential information conditioned on channel outputs at\nthe wire-tapper. The performance measure of interest for the GMAC with\nconfidential messages is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common\nrate, two private rates and two equivocation rates as components.

    "summary": "The capacity regions are investigated for two relay broadcast channels\n(RBCs), where relay links are incorporated into standard two-user broadcast\nchannels to support user cooperation. In the first channel, the Partially\nCooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, only one user in the system can act as a\nrelay and transmit to the other user through a relay link. An achievable rate\nregion is derived based on the relay using the decode-and-forward scheme. An\nouter bound on the capacity region is derived and is shown to be tighter than\nthe cut-set bound. For the special case where the Partially Cooperative RBC is\ndegraded, the achievable rate region is shown to be tight and provides the\ncapacity region. Gaussian Partially Cooperative RBCs and Partially Cooperative\nRBCs with feedback are further studied. In the second channel model being\nstudied in the paper, the Fully Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, both users\ncan act as relay nodes and transmit to each other through relay links. This is\na more general model than the Partially Cooperative RBC. All the results for\nPartially Cooperative RBCs are correspondingly generalized to the Fully\nCooperative RBCs. It is further shown that the AWGN Fully Cooperative RBC has a\nlarger achievable rate region than the AWGN Partially Cooperative RBC.

    "summary": "We consider the multiple-access communication problem in a distributed\nsetting for both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the discrete\nmemoryless channel. We propose a scheme called Distributed Rate Splitting to\nachieve the optimal rates allowed by information theory in a distributed\nmanner. In this scheme, each real user creates a number of virtual users via a\npower/rate splitting mechanism in the M-user Gaussian channel or via a random\nswitching mechanism in the M-user discrete memoryless channel. At the receiver,\nall virtual users are successively decoded. Compared with other multiple-access\ntechniques, Distributed Rate Splitting can be implemented with lower complexity\nand less coordination. Furthermore, in a symmetric setting, we show that the\nrate tuple achieved by this scheme converges to the maximum equal rate point\nallowed by the information-theoretic bound as the number of virtual users per\nreal user tends to infinity. When the capacity regions are asymmetric, we show\nthat a point on the dominant face can be achieved asymptotically. Finally, when\nthere is an unequal number of virtual users per real user, we show that\ndifferential user rate requirements can be accommodated in a distributed\nfashion."

    "summary": "This paper outlines a three-step procedure for determining the low bit error\nrate performance curve of a wide class of LDPC codes of moderate length. The\ntraditional method to estimate code performance in the higher SNR region is to\nuse a sum of the contributions of the most dominant error events to the\nprobability of error. These dominant error events will be both code and decoder\ndependent, consisting of low-weight codewords as well as non-codeword events if\nML decoding is not used. For even moderate length codes, it is not feasible to\nfind all of these dominant error events with a brute force search. The proposed\nmethod provides a convenient way to evaluate very low bit error rate\nperformance of an LDPC code without requiring knowledge of the complete error\nevent weight spectrum or resorting to a Monte Carlo simulation. This new method\ncan be applied to various types of decoding such as the full belief propagation\nversion of the message passing algorithm or the commonly used min-sum\napproximation to belief propagation. The proposed method allows one to\nefficiently see error performance at bit error rates that were previously out\nof reach of Monte Carlo methods. This result will provide a solid foundation\nfor the analysis and design of LDPC codes and decoders that are required to\nprovide a guaranteed very low bit error rate performance at certain SNRs."

    "summary": "Assuming iterative decoding for binary erasure channels (BECs), a novel\ntree-based technique for upper bounding the bit error rates (BERs) of\narbitrary, finite low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is provided and the\nresulting bound can be evaluated for all operating erasure probabilities,\nincluding both the waterfall and the error floor regions. This upper bound can\nalso be viewed as a narrowing search of stopping sets, which is an approach\ndifferent from the stopping set enumeration used for lower bounding the error\nfloor. When combined with optimal leaf-finding modules, this upper bound is\nguaranteed to be tight in terms of the asymptotic order. The Boolean framework\nproposed herein further admits a composite search for even tighter results. For\ncomparison, a refinement of the algorithm is capable of exhausting all stopping\nsets of size <14 for irregular LDPC codes of length n=500, which requires\napproximately 1.67*10^25 trials if a brute force approach is taken. These\nexperiments indicate that this upper bound can be used both as an analytical\ntool and as a deterministic worst-performance (error floor) guarantee, the\nlatter of which is crucial to optimizing LDPC codes for extremely low BER\napplications, e.g., optical/satellite communications."

First, it is assumed that the input\nis subject only to an average power constraint. In this case, a lower bound to\nthe random coding error exponent is considered and the optimal input achieving\nthis lower bound is shown to have a discrete amplitude and uniform phase. If\nthe input is subject to both average and peak power constraints, it is proven\nthat the optimal input achieving the random coding error exponent has again a\ndiscrete nature. Finally, the cutoff rate is analyzed, and the optimality of\nthe single-mass input amplitude distribution in the low-power regime is\ndiscussed."

A\nmesh network is defined as a heterogeneous wireless network in which the\ntransmission among power limited nodes is assisted by powerful relays, which\nuse the same wireless medium. We find the capacity of the mesh network when\nthere is one source, one destination, and multiple relays. We call this channel\nthe single source multiple relay single destination (SSMRSD) mesh network. Our\napproach is as follows. We first look at an upper bound on the information\ntheoretic capacity of these networks in the Gaussian setting. We then show that\nthe bound is achievable asymptotically using the compress-forward strategy for\nthe multiple relay channel. Theoretically, the results indicate the value of\ncooperation and the utility of carefully deployed relays in wireless ad-hoc and\nsensor networks. The capacity characterization quantifies how the relays can be\nused to either conserve node energy or to increase transmission rate."

    "summary": "The recovery of network structure from experimental data is a basic and\nfundamental problem. Unfortunately, experimental data often do not directly\nreveal structure due to inherent limitations such as imprecision in timing or\nother observation mechanisms. We consider the problem of inferring network\nstructure in the form of a directed graph from co-occurrence observations. Each\nobservation arises from a transmission made over the network and indicates\nwhich vertices carry the transmission without explicitly conveying their order\nin the path. Without order information, there are an exponential number of\nfeasible graphs which agree with the observed data equally well. Yet, the basic\nphysical principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that all feasible\ngraphs are not equally likely. In particular, vertices that co-occur in many\nobservations are probably closely connected. Previous approaches to this\nproblem are based on ad hoc heuristics. We model the experimental observations\nas independent realizations of a random walk on the underlying graph, subjected\nto a random permutation which accounts for the lack of order information.\nTreating the permutations as missing data, we derive an exact\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the random walk\nparameters. For long transmission paths the exact E-step may be computationally\nintractable, so we also describe an efficient Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm\nand derive conditions which ensure convergence of the MCEM algorithm with high\nprobability. Simulations and experiments with Internet measurements demonstrate\nthe promise of this approach."

Due to its efficiency,\nbeamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wireless\ncommunication standards. Prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts the\nblock fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels is\nneglected. This paper considers temporally-correlated channels and designs\nsingle-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. Analytical results\nconcerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order\nfinite-state Markov chain. These results include the source bit rate generated\nby time-varying quantized CSI, the required bit rate for a CSI feedback\nchannel, and the effect of feedback delay. In particular, based on the theory\nof Markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce the\nthroughput gain due to CSI feedback at least exponentially. Furthermore, an\nalgorithm is proposed for CSI feedback compression in time. Combining the\nresults in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedback\nbeamforming as demonstrated by a design example."

Using these results we further show that for some LDPC codes, there\nare no other minimum pseudo-codewords except the real multiples of minimum\ncodewords. This means that the LP decoding for these LDPC codes is\nasymptotically optimal in the sense that the ratio of the probabilities of\ndecoding errors of LP decoding and maximum-likelihood decoding approaches to 1\nas the signal-to-noise ratio leads to infinity.

Motivated by the\nlack of appropriate error rate analysis techniques for this popular type of\nsystem and channel model, we present two novel analytical methods for bit error\nrate (BER) estimation of coded multicarrier systems operating over\nfrequency-selective quasi-static channels with non-ideal interleaving. In the\nfirst method, the approximate performance of the system is calculated for each\nrealization of the channel, which is suitable for obtaining the outage BER\nperformance (a common performance measure for e.g. MB-OFDM systems). The second\nmethod assumes Rayleigh distributed frequency-domain subcarrier channel gains\nand knowledge of their correlation matrix, and can be used to directly obtain\nthe average BER performance. Both methods are applicable to\nconvolutionally-coded interleaved multicarrier systems employing Quadrature\nAmplitude Modulation (QAM), and are also able to account for narrowband\ninterference (modeled as a sum of tone interferers). To illustrate the\napplication of the proposed analysis, both methods are used to study the\nperformance of a tone-interference-impaired MB-OFDM system."

    "summary": "For a wide class of multi-user systems, a subset of capacity region which\nincludes the corner points and the sum-capacity facet has a special structure\nknown as polymatroid. Multiaccess channels with fixed input distributions and\nmultiple-antenna broadcast channels are examples of such systems. Any interior\npoint of the sum-capacity facet can be achieved by time-sharing among corner\npoints or by an alternative method known as rate-splitting. The main purpose of\nthis paper is to find a point on the sum-capacity facet which satisfies a\nnotion of fairness among active users. This problem is addressed in two cases:\n(i) where the complexity of achieving interior points is not feasible, and (ii)\nwhere the complexity of achieving interior points is feasible. For the first\ncase, the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is\nmaximized (max-min corner point) is desired for signaling. A simple greedy\nalgorithm is introduced to find the optimum max-min corner point. For the\nsecond case, the polymatroid properties are exploited to locate a rate-vector\non the sum-capacity facet which is optimally fair in the sense that the minimum\nrate among all users is maximized (max-min rate). In the case that the rate of\nsome users can not increase further (attain the max-min value), the algorithm\nrecursively maximizes the minimum rate among the rest of the users. It is shown\nthat the problems of deriving the time-sharing coefficients or rate-spitting\nscheme can be solved by decomposing the problem to some lower-dimensional\nsubproblems. In addition, a fast algorithm to compute the time-sharing\ncoefficients to attain a general point on the sum-capacity facet is proposed."

    "summary": "A code over GF$(q^m)$ can be imaged or expanded into a code over GF$(q)$\nusing a basis for the extension field over the base field. The properties of\nsuch an image depend on the original code and the basis chosen for imaging.\nProblems relating the properties of a code and its image with respect to a\nbasis have been of great interest in the field of coding theory. In this work,\na generalized version of the problem of self-orthogonality of the $q$-ary image\nof a $q^m$-ary code has been considered. Given an inner product (more\ngenerally, a biadditive form), necessary and sufficient conditions have been\nderived for a code over a field extension and an expansion basis so that an\nimage of that code is self-orthogonal. The conditions require that the original\ncode be self-orthogonal with respect to several related biadditive forms\nwhenever certain power sums of the dual basis elements do not vanish. Numerous\ninteresting corollaries have been derived by specializing the general\nconditions. An interesting result for the canonical or regular inner product in\nfields of characteristic two is that only self-orthogonal codes result in\nself-orthogonal images. Another result is that image of a code is\nself-orthogonal for all bases if and only if trace of the code is\nself-orthogonal, except for the case of binary images of 4-ary codes. The\nconditions are particularly simple to state and apply for cyclic codes. To\nillustrate a possible application, new quantum error-correcting codes have been\nconstructed with larger minimum distance than previously known."

An example of a process\njointly correlated to another one is the hidden Markov process. It is the\nmemoryless observation of the Markov state process where state transitions are\nindependent of past observations. We consider a new representation of hidden\nMarkov process using iterated function system. In this representation the state\ntransitions are deterministically related to the process. This representation\nprovides a unified framework for the analysis of the two limiting entropies for\nthis process, resulting in integral expressions for the limits.

    "summary": "On the multi-antenna broadcast channel, the spatial degrees of freedom\nsupport simultaneous transmission to multiple users. The optimal multiuser\ntransmission, known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable.\nMoreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding are\nsensitive to CSI inaccuracy. This paper considers a more practical design\ncalled per user unitary and rate control (PU2RC), which has been proposed for\nemerging cellular standards. PU2RC supports multiuser simultaneous\ntransmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuser\ndiversity. Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding)\nconstraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook\nof multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling\nlaws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser-interference-limited regime, the\nthroughput of PU2RC is shown to scale logarithmically with the number of users.\nIn the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale\ndouble logarithmically with the number of users and also linearly with the\nnumber of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show\nthat PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI\nquantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if\nthe number of users is sufficiently large."

New upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML)\ndecoding error probability are derived. These bounds are applied to various\nensembles of turbo-like codes, focusing especially on repeat-accumulate codes\nand their recent variations which possess low encoding and decoding complexity\nand exhibit remarkable performance under iterative decoding. The framework of\nthe second version of the Duman and Salehi (DS2) bounds is generalized to the\ncase of parallel channels, along with the derivation of their optimized tilting\nmeasures. The connection between the generalized DS2 and the 1961 Gallager\nbounds, addressed by Divsalar and by Sason and Shamai for a single channel, is\nexplored in the case of an arbitrary number of independent parallel channels.\nThe generalization of the DS2 bound for parallel channels enables to re-derive\nspecific bounds which were originally derived by Liu et al. as special cases of\nthe Gallager bound. In the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend\nto infinity, the new bounds are used to obtain improved inner bounds on the\nattainable channel regions under ML decoding. The tightness of the new bounds\nfor independent parallel channels is exemplified for structured ensembles of\nturbo-like codes.

    "summary": "Broadly speaking Information theory (IT) assumes no structure of the\nunderlying states. But what about contexts where states do have a clear\nstructure - how should IT cope with such situations? And if such coping is at\nall possible then - how should structure be expressed so that it can be coped\nwith? A possible answer to these questions is presented here. Noting that IT\ncan cope well with a structure expressed as an accurate clustering (by shifting\nto the implied reduced alphabet), a generalization is suggested in which\nstructure is expressed as a measure on reduced alphabets. Given such structure\nan extension of IT is presented where the reduced alphabets are treated\nsimultaneously. This structure-sensitive IT, called ITs, extends traditional IT\nin the sense that: a)there are structure-sensitive analogs to the notions of\ntraditional IT and b)translating a theorem in IT by replacing its notions with\ntheir structure-sensitive counterparts, yields a (provable) theorem of ITs.\nSeemingly paradoxically, ITs extends IT but it's completely within the\nframework of IT. The richness of the suggested structures is demonstrated by\ntwo disparate families studied in more detail: the family of hierarchical\nstructures and the family of linear structures. The formal findings extend the\nscope of cases to which a rigorous application of IT can be applied (with\nimplications on quantization, for example). The implications on the foundations\nof IT are that the assumption regarding no underlying structure of states is\nnot mandatory and that there is a framework for expressing such underlying\nstructure."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of estimating the total probability of all symbols\nthat appear with a given frequency in a string of i.i.d. random variables with\nunknown distribution. We focus on the regime in which the block length is large\nyet no symbol appears frequently in the string. This is accomplished by\nallowing the distribution to change with the block length. Under a natural\nconvergence assumption on the sequence of underlying distributions, we show\nthat the total probabilities converge to a deterministic limit, which we\ncharacterize. We then show that the Good-Turing total probability estimator is\nstrongly consistent."

Assuming no channel state information at the transmitter, we compare\nseveral linear single-user detection and spreading schemes, with or without\nchannel coding, achieving a spectral efficiency of 1-2 bits/s/Hz. The different\nresults obtained demonstrate that spatial diversity significantly improves the\nperformance of MC-CDMA systems, and allows different chip-mapping without\nnotably decreasing performance. Moreover, the global system exhibits a good\ntrade-off between complexity at mobile stations and performance.

For MS decoding, the analysis is done by upper bounding the bit error\nprobability of the root bit of a tree code by the sequence error probability of\na subcode of the tree code assuming the transmission of the all-zero codeword.\nThe result is a recursive upper bound on the bit error probability after each\niteration. For SP decoding, we derive a recursively determined lower bound on\nthe bit error probability after each iteration. This recursive lower bound\nrecovers the density evolution equation of LDPC codes on the binary erasure\nchannel (BEC) with inequalities satisfied with equalities. A significant\nimplication of this result is that the performance of LDPC codes under SP\ndecoding on the BEC is an upper bound of the performance on all MBIOS channels\nwith the same uncoded bit error probability. All results hold for the more\ngeneral multi-edge type LDPC codes."

    "summary": "Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with support $S$ and $f : S \\to\nS^\\prime$ be a bijection. Then it is well-known that the entropy of $X$ is the\nsame as the entropy of $f(X)$. This entropy preservation property has been\nwell-utilized to establish non-trivial properties of discrete stochastic\nprocesses, e.g. queuing process \\cite{prg03}. Entropy as well as entropy\npreservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or\ncontinuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous\nrandom variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of\nentropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood.\n  In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a\nmixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and\nthe other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing\ndefinitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from\ndiscrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such\nthat their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to\nobtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete\nand continuous random variables under bijections.\n  The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous\ntime Markov chains. As an application, we recover a known probabilistic result\nrelated to Poisson process. We strongly believe that the frame-work developed\nin this paper can be useful in establishing probabilistic properties of complex\nprocesses, such as load balancing systems, queuing network, caching algorithms."

If\n$M>1$ and channel matrices are non-degenerate then the precise degrees of\nfreedom $\\eta_X^\\star = {4/3}M$. Simple zero forcing without dirty paper\nencoding or successive decoding, suffices to achieve the ${4/3}M$ degrees of\nfreedom. With equal number of antennas at all nodes, we explore the increase in\ndegrees of freedom when some of the messages are made available to a\ntransmitter or receiver in the manner of cognitive radio. With a cognitive\ntransmitter we show that the number of degrees of freedom $\\eta = {3/2}M$ (for\n$M>1$) on the MIMO $X$ channel. The same degrees of freedom are obtained on the\nMIMO $X$ channel with a cognitive receiver as well. In contrast to the $X$\nchannel result, we show that for the MIMO \\emph{interference} channel, the\ndegrees of freedom are not increased even if both the transmitter and the\nreceiver of one user know the other user's message. However, the interference\nchannel can achieve the full $2M$ degrees of freedom if \\emph{each} user has\neither a cognitive transmitter or a cognitive receiver. Lastly, if the channels\nvary with time/frequency then the $X$ channel with single antennas $(M=1)$ at\nall nodes has exactly 4/3 degrees of freedom with no shared messages and\nexactly 3/2 degrees of freedom with a cognitive transmitter or a cognitive\nreceiver."

We begin by showing that for expander codes, every\nfractional pseudocodeword always has at least a constant fraction of\nnon-integral bits. We then prove that for expander codes, the active set of any\nfractional pseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set\nof any codeword. We exploit this fact to devise a decoding algorithm that\nprovably outperforms the LP decoder for finite blocklengths. It proceeds by\nguessing facets of the polytope, and resolving the linear program on these\nfacets. While the LP decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest\nlikelihood over all pseudocodewords, we prove that for expander codes the\nproposed algorithm succeeds even with a constant number of pseudocodewords of\nhigher likelihood. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is only a\nconstant factor larger than that of the LP decoder."

We\nfirst review classical results, i.e., the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59) bound of\nShannon for the Gaussian channel, and the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67) bound of\nShannon et al. for discrete memoryless channels. A recent improvement on the\nSP67 bound, as suggested by Valembois and Fossorier, is also discussed. These\nconcepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound on the decoding error\nprobability (referred to as the ISP bound) which is uniformly tighter than the\nSP67 bound and its recent improved version. The ISP bound is applicable to\nsymmetric memoryless channels, and some of its applications are exemplified.\nIts tightness is studied by comparing it with bounds on the ML decoding error\nprobability, and computer simulations of iteratively decoded turbo-like codes.\nThe paper also presents a technique which performs the entire calculation of\nthe SP59 bound in the logarithmic domain, thus facilitating the exact\ncalculation of this bound for moderate to large block lengths without the need\nfor the asymptotic approximations provided by Shannon."

For a two hop parallel AF relay MAC,\nassuming a sum power constraint across all relays we characterize optimal relay\namplification factors and the resulting capacity regions. We find that the\nparallel AF relay MAC with total transmit power of the two users $P_1+P_2=P$\nand total relay power $P_R$ is the dual of the parallel AF relay BC where the\nMAC source nodes become the BC destination nodes, the MAC destination node\nbecomes the BC source node, the dual BC source transmit power is $P_R$ and the\ntotal transmit power of the AF relays is $P$. The duality means that the\ncapacity region of the AF relay MAC with a sum power constraint $P$ on the\ntransmitters is the same as that of the dual BC. The duality relationship is\nfound to be useful in characterizing the capacity region of the AF relay BC as\nthe union of MAC capacity regions. The duality extends to distributed relays\nwith multiple antennas and more than 2 hops as well."

Under the assumption that the channel states take values in a\nfinite alphabet, we find an achievable rate and an upper bound on the capacity.\nWe further show that when the channel is indecomposable, and has no intersymbol\ninterference (ISI), its capacity is given by the limit of the maximum of the\n(normalized) directed information between the input $X^N$ and the output $Y^N$,\ni.e. $C = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\max I(X^N \\to Y^N)$, where the\nmaximization is taken over the causal conditioning probability\n$Q(x^N||z^{N-1})$ defined in this paper. The capacity result is used to show\nthat the source-channel separation theorem holds for time-invariant determinist\nfeedback.

    "summary": "This work considers the problem of communication from a single transmitter,\nover a network with colocated users, through an independent block Rayleigh\nfading channel. The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which\nincreases the overall achievable rate, from the transmitter to the destined\nuser. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers\nhave access to perfect channel state information (CSI). This gives rise to the\nmulti-layer broadcast approach used by the transmitter. The broadcast approach\nallows, in our network setting, to improve the cooperation between the\ncolocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better\nthe channel quality, the more layers that can be decoded. The cooperation\nbetween the users is performed over an additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN),\nwith a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used\ncooperation techniques are studied: amplify-forward (AF), compress-forward\n(CF), and decode-forward (DF). These methods are extended using the broadcast\napproach, for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case a\nseparated processing of the layers, which includes multi-session cooperation is\nshown to be beneficial. Further, closed form expressions for infinitely many AF\nsessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical\nresults for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate the efficiency of\nmulti-session cooperation."

We develop schemes to optimize the\nratio, $\\rho(n)$ of achievable network sum capacity to the sum of the\npoint-to-point capacities of source-destinations pairs operating in isolation.\nFor fixed SNR networks, i.e., where the worst case SNR over the\nsource-destination pairs is fixed independent of $n$, we show that\ncollaborative strategies yield a scaling law of $\\rho(n) = {\\cal\nO}(\\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ in contrast to multi-hop strategies which yield a\nscaling law of $\\rho(n) = {\\cal O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$. While, networks where\nworst case SNR goes to zero, do not preclude the possibility of collaboration,\nmulti-hop strategies achieve optimal throughput. The plausible reason is that\nthe gains due to collaboration cannot offset the effect of vanishing receive\nSNR. This suggests that for fixed SNR networks, a network designer should look\nfor network protocols that exploit collaboration. The fact that most current\nnetworks operate in a fixed SNR interference limited environment provides\nfurther motivation for considering this regime."

We devise bilayer LDPC\ncodes to approach the theoretically promised rate of the decode-and-forward\nrelaying strategy by incorporating relay-generated information bits in\nspecially designed bilayer graphical code structures. While conventional LDPC\ncodes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel\nparameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two\ndifferent channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at\nthe destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer\ndensity evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution\nalgorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is\ndeveloped for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively\nimproved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach the\ntheoretical decode-and-forward rate for a wide range of channel parameters,\nthis paper proposes two different forms bilayer codes, the bilayer-expurgated\nand bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that a properly designed\nbilayer LDPC code can achieve an asymptotic infinite-length threshold within\n0.24 dB gap to the Shannon limits of two different channels simultaneously for\na wide range of channel parameters. By practical code construction,\nfinite-length bilayer codes are shown to be able to approach within a 0.6 dB\ngap to the theoretical decode-and-forward rate of the relay channel at a block\nlength of $10^5$ and a bit-error probability (BER) of $10^{-4}$. Finally, it is\ndemonstrated that a generalized version of the proposed bilayer code\nconstruction is applicable to relay networks with multiple relays."

More specifically, we consider\na framework comprising an additive white forward channel and a backward link\nwhich is used for feedback. We consider two types of corruption mechanisms in\nthe backward link. The first is quantization noise, i.e., the encoder receives\nthe quantized values of the past outputs of the forward channel. The\nquantization is uniform, memoryless and time invariant (that is,\nsymbol-by-symbol scalar quantization), with bounded quantization error. The\nsecond corruption mechanism is an arbitrarily distributed additive bounded\nnoise in the backward link. Here we allow symbol-by-symbol encoding at the\ninput to the backward channel. We propose simple explicit schemes that\nguarantee positive information rate, in bits per channel use, with positive\nerror exponent. If the forward channel is additive white Gaussian then our\nschemes achieve capacity, in the limit of diminishing amplitude of the noise\ncomponents at the backward link, while guaranteeing that the probability of\nerror converges to zero as a doubly exponential function of the block length.\nFurthermore, if the forward channel is additive white Gaussian and the backward\nlink consists of an additive bounded noise channel, with signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) constrained symbol-by-symbol encoding, then our schemes are also\ncapacity-achieving in the limit of high SNR."

The discrete-time\ndecision statistics are obtained as the output samples of a bank of symbol\nmatched filters of all users. The crosscorrelation matrix is studied when the\nnumber of symbols transmitted by each user tends to infinity. Two levels of\nasynchronism are considered. One is symbol-asynchronous but chip-synchronous,\nand the other is chip-asynchronous. The existence of a nonrandom ASD is proved\nby moment convergence theorem, where the focus is on the derivation of\nasymptotic eigenvalue moments (AEM) of the crosscorrelation matrix. A\ncombinatorics approach based on noncrossing partition of set partition theory\nis adopted for AEM computation. The spectral efficiency and the minimum\nmean-square-error (MMSE) achievable by a linear receiver of asynchronous CDMA\nare plotted by AEM using a numerical method."

However, it is a critical question to understand the\nmathematical principle underlying the algorithm.

This paper offers an alternative approach to understand the\nnormalized min-sum algorithm. The algorithm is derived directly from\ncooperative optimization, a newly discovered general method for\nglobal/combinatorial optimization.

The Declercq and Fossorier's algorithm speeds up\nthe computation by reducing the number of configurations, while our algorithm\nuses the dynamic programming instead. Compared with the configuration reduction\nalgorithm, the dynamic programming one is simpler at the design stage because\nit has less parameters to tune.

Usually, each iteration of the min-sum algorithm\ncontains two scans, the horizontal scan and the vertical scan. This paper\npresents a single-scan version of the min-sum algorithm to speed up the\ndecoding process. It can also reduce memory usage or wiring because it only\nneeds the addressing from check nodes to variable nodes while the original\nmin-sum algorithm requires that addressing plus the addressing from variable\nnodes to check nodes. To cut down memory usage or wiring further, another\nversion of the single-scan min-sum algorithm is presented where the messages of\nthe algorithm are represented by single bit values instead of using fixed point\nones. The software implementation has shown that the single-scan min-sum\nalgorithm is more than twice as fast as the original min-sum algorithm."

We examine several subcases of this most\ngeneral problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays\n(half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or\nnon-clustered). We first study the multiple antenna relay channel with a\nfull-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in\nthe direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable\nperformance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF)\nprotocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals\nhave one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the\ndegrees of freedom in the direct link is increased, whereas CF continues to\nperform optimally. We also study the multiple antenna relay channel with a\nhalf-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly\nbe different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for\nhalf-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the\nhalf-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC)\nDMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source-destination pair and\nmultiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the\nidealistic assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this\nvirtual multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real\nMIMO DMT.

In addition, one also needs to choose\nthe Voronoi cell size of the central lattice v, the sublattice index N, and the\nnumber of side descriptions K to minimize the expected MDLVQ distortion, given\nthe total entropy rate of all side descriptions Rt and description loss\nprobability p. In this paper we propose a linear-time MDLVQ index assignment\nalgorithm for any K >= 2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, based on a\nnew construction of so-called K-fraction lattice. The algorithm is greedy in\nnature but is proven to be asymptotically (N -> infinity) optimal for any K >=\n2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, given Rt and p. The result is\nstronger when K = 2: the optimality holds for finite N as well, under some mild\nconditions. For K > 2, a local adjustment algorithm is developed to augment the\ngreedy index assignment, and conjectured to be optimal for finite N.\n  Our algorithmic study also leads to better understanding of v, N and K in\noptimal MDLVQ design. For K = 2 we derive, for the first time, a\nnon-asymptotical closed form expression of the expected distortion of optimal\nMDLVQ in p, Rt, N.

These failures can cause the large signal-to-noise ratio\nperformance of message-passing iterative decoding to be worse than that\npredicted by the maximum-likelihood decoding union bound. In this paper we\naddress the pseudo-codeword problem from the convolutional-code perspective. In\nparticular, we compare the performance of LDPC convolutional codes with that of\ntheir ``wrapped'' quasi-cyclic block versions and we show that the minimum\npseudo-weight of an LDPC convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum\npseudo-weight of an underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result, which parallels\na well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional\ncodes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due\nto the fact that every pseudo-codeword in the convolutional code induces a\npseudo-codeword in the block code with pseudo-weight no larger than that of the\nconvolutional code's pseudo-codeword. This difference in the weight spectra\nleads to improved performance at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios for the\nconvolutional code, a conclusion supported by simulation results."

We assume a 2D digital storage channel,\nwhere the MRF is interleaved before being written and then read by a 2D\ntransducer; such channels occur in recently proposed optical disk storage\nsystems. The detection algorithm is a concatenation of two\nsoft-input/soft-output (SISO) detectors: an iterative row-column soft-decision\nfeedback (IRCSDF) ISI detector, and a MRF detector. The MRF detector is a SISO\nversion of the stochastic relaxation algorithm by Geman and Geman in IEEE\nTrans. Pattern Anal. and Mach. Intell., Nov. 1984. On the 2 x 2 averaging-mask\nISI channel, at a bit error rate (BER) of 10^{-5}, the concatenated algorithm\nachieves SNR savings of between 0.5 and 2.0 dB over the IRCSDF detector alone;\nthe savings increase as the MRFs become more correlated, or as the SNR\ndecreases.

A concrete framework is\npresented, admitting systematic searches for new bounds. Two noise measures are\nconsidered: the Bhattacharyya noise parameter and the soft bit value for a\nmaximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder on the uncoded channel. For Zm\nLDPC codes, an iterative m-dimensional bound is derived for\nm-ary-input/symmetric-output channels, which gives a sufficient stability\ncondition for Zm LDPC codes and is complemented by a matched necessary\nstability condition introduced herein. Applications to coded modulation and to\ncodes with non-equiprobable distributed codewords are also discussed.\n  For binary codes, two new lower bounds are provided for symmetric channels,\nincluding a two-dimensional iterative bound and a one-dimensional non-iterative\nbound, the latter of which is the best known bound that is tight for binary\nsymmetric channels (BSCs), and is a strict improvement over the bound derived\nby the channel degradation argument. By adopting the reverse channel\nperspective, upper and lower bounds on the decodable Bhattacharyya noise\nparameter are derived for non-symmetric channels, which coincides with the\nexisting bound for symmetric channels."

    "summary": "In this work, the delay limited capacity (DLC) of orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) systems is investigated. The analysis is organized\ninto two parts. In the first part, the impact of system parameters on the OFDM\nDLC is analyzed in a general setting. The main results are that under weak\nassumptions the maximum achievable single user DLC is almost independent of the\ndistribution of the path attenuations in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region\nbut depends strongly on the delay spread. In the high SNR region the roles are\nexchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of\nthe distribution becomes dominant. The relevant asymptotic quantities are\nderived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation\nstructure. Moreover, for both cases it is shown that the DLC is maximized if\nthe total channel energy is uniformly spread, i.e. the power delay profile is\nuniform. It is worth pointing out that since universal bounds are obtained the\nresults can also be used for other classes of parallel channels with block\nfading characteristic. The second part extends the setting to the broadcast\nchannel and studies the corresponding OFDM DLC BC region. An algorithm for\ncomputing the OFDM BC DLC region is presented. To derive simple but smart\nresource allocation strategies, the principle of rate water-filling employing\norder statistics is introduced. This yields analytical lower bounds on the OFDM\nDLC region based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and\nordinal channel state information (CSI). Finally, the schemes are compared to\nan algorithm using full CSI."

This low-complexity scheme operates only a\nfew dB away from capacity but does require very accurate channel knowledge at\nthe transmitter, which can be very difficult to obtain in fading scenarios. We\nconsider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel\nperfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel\nfeedback bits from each receiver. Using a random vector quantization argument,\nwe quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a\nfunction of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve\nproportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we\nshow that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is\nsufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we investigate a simple\nscalar quantization scheme that is seen to achieve the same scaling behavior as\nvector quantization."

Our eavesdropper can be viewed as\nthe wireless counterpart of Wyner's wiretapper. The secrecy capacity of such a\nsystem is characterized under the assumption of asymptotically long coherence\nintervals. We first consider the full Channel State Information (CSI) case,\nwhere the transmitter has access to the channel gains of the legitimate\nreceiver and the eavesdropper. The secrecy capacity under this full CSI\nassumption serves as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity when only the CSI\nof the legitimate receiver is known at the transmitter, which is characterized\nnext. In each scenario, the perfect secrecy capacity is obtained along with the\noptimal power and rate allocation strategies. We then propose a low-complexity\non/off power allocation strategy that achieves near-optimal performance with\nonly the main channel CSI. More specifically, this scheme is shown to be\nasymptotically optimal as the average SNR goes to infinity, and interestingly,\nis shown to attain the secrecy capacity under the full CSI assumption.\nRemarkably, our results reveal the positive impact of fading on the secrecy\ncapacity and establish the critical role of rate adaptation, based on the main\nchannel CSI, in facilitating secure communications over slow fading channels."

    "summary": "Our understanding of information in systems has been based on the foundation\nof memoryless processes. Extensions to stable Markov and auto-regressive\nprocesses are classical. Berger proved a source coding theorem for the\nmarginally unstable Wiener process, but the infinite-horizon exponentially\nunstable case has been open since Gray's 1970 paper. There were also no\ntheorems showing what is needed to communicate such processes across noisy\nchannels.\n  In this work, we give a fixed-rate source-coding theorem for the\ninfinite-horizon problem of coding an exponentially unstable Markov process.\nThe encoding naturally results in two distinct bitstreams that have\nqualitatively different QoS requirements for communicating over a noisy medium.\nThe first stream captures the information that is accumulating within the\nnonstationary process and requires sufficient anytime reliability from the\nchannel used to communicate the process. The second stream captures the\nhistorical information that dissipates within the process and is essentially\nclassical. This historical information can also be identified with a natural\nstable counterpart to the unstable process. A converse demonstrating the\nfundamentally layered nature of unstable sources is given by means of\ninformation-embedding ideas."

This paper\ninstead considers a streaming setting in which iid source symbol pairs are\nrevealed to the separate encoders in real time and need to be reconstructed at\nthe decoder with some tolerable end-to-end delay using finite rate noiseless\nchannels. A sequential random binning argument is used to derive a lower bound\non the error exponent with delay and show that both ML decoding and universal\ndecoding achieve the same positive error exponents inside the traditional\nSlepian-Wolf rate region. The error events are different from the block-coding\nerror events and give rise to slightly different exponents. Because the\nsequential random binning scheme is also universal over delays, the resulting\ncode eventually reconstructs every source symbol correctly with probability 1."

While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity\n(parametrized by reliability) called \"anytime capacity\" is both necessary and\nsufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log\nof the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the\ndesired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy\nobservations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the\ncontroller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar\nstabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with\nfeedback.\n  Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is\nthe magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role. To deal\nwith such systems, the concept of the anytime rate-region is introduced. This\nis the region of rates that the channel can support while still meeting\npotentially different anytime reliability targets for parallel message streams.\nAll the scalar results generalize on an eigenvalue by eigenvalue basis. When\nthere is no explicit feedback of the noisy channel outputs, the intrinsic delay\nof the unstable system tells us what the feedback delay needs to be while\nevaluating the anytime-rate-region for the channel. An example involving a\nbinary erasure channel is used to illustrate how differentiated service is\nrequired in any separation-based control architecture."

Halting computations\ncan be recognised by simply running them; the main difficulty is to detect\nnon-halting programs. Our approach is to have the probability space extend over\nboth space and time and to consider the probability that a random $N$-bit\nprogram has halted by a random time. We postulate an a priori computable\nprobability distribution on all possible runtimes and we prove that given an\ninteger k>0, we can effectively compute a time bound T such that the\nprobability that an N-bit program will eventually halt given that it has not\nhalted by T is smaller than 2^{-k}. We also show that the set of halting\nprograms (which is computably enumerable, but not computable) can be written as\na disjoint union of a computable set and a set of effectively vanishing\nprobability. Finally, we show that ``long'' runtimes are effectively rare. More\nformally, the set of times at which an N-bit program can stop after the time\n2^{N+constant} has effectively zero density."

In this paper we construct a structured class of asymptotically\noptimal quantizers for this problem: under the assumption of high correlation\nbetween source X and side information Y, we show there exist quantizers within\nour class whose performance comes arbitrarily close to Wyner's bound. As an\napplication illustrating the relevance of the high-correlation asymptotics, we\nalso explore the use of these quantizers in the context of a problem of data\ncompression for sensor networks, in a setup involving a large number of devices\ncollecting highly correlated measurements within a confined area.

    "summary": "The capacity of a class of deterministic relay channels with the transmitter\ninput X, the receiver output Y, the relay output Y_1 = f(X, Y), and a separate\ncommunication link from the relay to the receiver with capacity R_0, is shown\nto be\n  C(R_0) = \\max_{p(x)} \\min \\{I(X;Y)+R_0, I(X;Y, Y_1) \\}.\n  Thus every bit from the relay is worth exactly one bit to the receiver. Two\nalternative coding schemes are presented that achieve this capacity. The first\nscheme, ``hash-and-forward'', is based on a simple yet novel use of random\nbinning on the space of relay outputs, while the second scheme uses the usual\n``compress-and-forward''. In fact, these two schemes can be combined together\nto give a class of optimal coding schemes. As a corollary, this relay capacity\nresult confirms a conjecture by Ahlswede and Han on the capacity of a channel\nwith rate-limited state information at the decoder in the special case when the\nchannel state is recoverable from the channel input and the output."

Signals transmitted from one user to another at\ndistance r apart are subject to a power loss of r^{-alpha}, as well as a random\nphase. We identify the scaling laws of the information theoretic capacity of\nthe network. In the case of dense networks, where the area is fixed and the\ndensity of nodes increasing, we show that the total capacity of the network\nscales linearly with n. This improves on the best known achievability result of\nn^{2/3} of Aeron and Saligrama, 2006. In the case of extended networks, where\nthe density of nodes is fixed and the area increasing linearly with n, we show\nthat this capacity scales as n^{2-alpha/2} for 2<alpha<3 and sqrt{n} for\nalpha>3. The best known earlier result (Xie and Kumar 2006) identified the\nscaling law for alpha > 4. Thus, much better scaling than multihop can be\nachieved in dense networks, as well as in extended networks with low\nattenuation. The performance gain is achieved by intelligent node cooperation\nand distributed MIMO communication.

    "summary": "Two broad classes of graphical modeling problems for codes can be identified\nin the literature: constructive and extractive problems. The former class of\nproblems concern the construction of a graphical model in order to define a new\ncode. The latter class of problems concern the extraction of a graphical model\nfor a (fixed) given code. The design of a new low-density parity-check code for\nsome given criteria (e.g. target block length and code rate) is an example of a\nconstructive problem. The determination of a graphical model for a classical\nlinear block code which implies a decoding algorithm with desired performance\nand complexity characteristics is an example of an extractive problem. This\nwork focuses on extractive graphical model problems and aims to lay out some of\nthe foundations of the theory of such problems for linear codes.\n  The primary focus of this work is a study of the space of all graphical\nmodels for a (fixed) given code. The tradeoff between cyclic topology and\ncomplexity in this space is characterized via the introduction of a new bound:\nthe tree-inducing cut-set bound. The proposed bound provides a more precise\ncharacterization of this tradeoff than that which can be obtained using\nexisting tools (e.g. the Cut-Set Bound) and can be viewed as a generalization\nof the square-root bound for tail-biting trellises to graphical models with\narbitrary cyclic topologies. Searching the space of graphical models for a\ngiven code is then enabled by introducing a set of basic graphical model\ntransformation operations which are shown to span this space. Finally,\nheuristics for extracting novel graphical models for linear block codes using\nthese transformations are investigated."

Optimal multiplicity\nassignment strategies of algebraic soft-decision decoding with infinite cost\nare first studied over erasure channels and the binary symmetric channel. The\ncorresponding decoding radii are calculated in closed forms and tight bounds on\nthe error probability are derived. The multiplicity assignment strategy and the\ncorresponding performance analysis are then generalized to characterize the\ndecoding region of algebraic softdecision decoding over a mixed error and\nbit-level erasure channel. The bit-level decoding region of the proposed\nmultiplicity assignment strategy is shown to be significantly larger than that\nof conventional Berlekamp-Massey decoding. As an application, a bit-level\ngeneralized minimum distance decoding algorithm is proposed. The proposed\ndecoding compares favorably with many other Reed-Solomon soft-decision decoding\nalgorithms over various channels.

The overall goal of the sensor network\nis to take measurements from an underlying random process, code and transmit\nthose measurement samples to a collector node in a cooperative multiple access\nchannel with potential feedback, and reconstruct the entire random process at\nthe collector node. We provide lower and upper bounds for the minimum\nachievable expected distortion when the underlying random process is Gaussian.\nWhen the Gaussian random process satisfies some general conditions, we evaluate\nthe lower and upper bounds explicitly, and show that they are of the same order\nfor a wide range of power constraints. Thus, for these random processes, under\nthese power constraints, we express the minimum achievable expected distortion\nas a function of the power constraint. Further, we show that the achievability\nscheme that achieves the lower bound on the distortion is a separation-based\nscheme that is composed of multi-terminal rate-distortion coding and\namplify-and-forward channel coding.

First, a Taylor development is used to\nshow that the \\textit{exact} output entropy cost function has a non-mixing\nminimum when this output is proportional to \\textit{any} of the non-Gaussian\nsources, and not only when the output is proportional to the lowest entropic\nsource. Second, in order to prove that mixing entropy minima exist when the\nsource densities are strongly multimodal, an entropy approximator is proposed.\nThe latter has the major advantage that an error bound can be provided. Even if\nthis approximator (and the associated bound) is used here in the BSS context,\nit can be applied for estimating the entropy of any random variable with\nmultimodal density."

    "summary": "The performance of codes defined from graphs depends on the expansion\nproperty of the underlying graph in a crucial way. Graph products, such as the\nzig-zag product and replacement product provide new infinite families of\nconstant degree expander graphs. The paper investigates the use of zig-zag and\nreplacement product graphs for the construction of codes on graphs. A\nmodification of the zig-zag product is also introduced, which can operate on\ntwo unbalanced biregular bipartite graphs."

For all\nthese protocols, we compute the Diversity-Multiplexing Gain Tradeoff (DMT). We\nconstruct DMT optimal codes for the protocols which are sphere decodable and,\nin certain cases, incur minimum possible delay. Our results establish that the\nDMT of the OAF protocol is identical to the DMT of the Non-Orthogonal Amplify\nand Forward (NAF) protocol. Two variants of the NSDF protocol are considered:\nfixed-NSDF and variable-NSDF protocol. In the variable-NSDF protocol, the\nfraction of time duration for which the source alone transmits is allowed to\nvary with the rate of communication. Among the class of static\namplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward protocols, the variable-NSDF\nprotocol is shown to have the best known DMT for any number of relays apart\nfrom the two-relay case. When there are two relays, the variable-NSDF protocol\nis shown to improve on the DMT of the best previously-known protocol for higher\nvalues of the multiplexing gain. Our results also establish that the fixed-NSDF\nprotocol has a better DMT than the NAF protocol for any number of relays.\nFinally, we present a DMT optimal code construction for the NAF protocol."

Motivated by some previous designs of phase shifts using suboptimal\nmethods, the following question is considered in this paper. For a given binary\ncode, how much PMEPR reduction can be achieved when the phase shifts are taken\nfrom a 2^h-ary phase-shift keying (2^h-PSK) constellation? A lower bound on the\nachievable PMEPR is established, which is related to the covering radius of the\nbinary code. Generally speaking, the achievable region of the PMEPR shrinks as\nthe covering radius of the binary code decreases. The bound is then applied to\nsome well understood codes, including nonredundant BPSK signaling, BCH codes\nand their duals, Reed-Muller codes, and convolutional codes. It is demonstrated\nthat most (presumably not optimal) phase-shift designs from the literature\nattain or approach our bound."

Both strategies utilize all available spatial\ndimensions and therefore have the same multiplexing gain, but an absolute\ndifference in terms of throughput does exist. The sum rate difference between\nthe two strategies is analytically computed at asymptotically high SNR, and it\nis seen that this asymptotic statistic provides an accurate characterization at\neven moderate SNR levels. Furthermore, the difference is not affected by\nasymmetric channel behavior when each user a has different average SNR.\nWeighted sum rate maximization is also considered, and a similar quantification\nof the throughput difference between the two strategies is performed. In the\nprocess, it is shown that allocating user powers in direct proportion to user\nweights asymptotically maximizes weighted sum rate. For multiple antenna users,\nuniform power allocation across the receive antennas is applied after\ndistributing power proportional to the user weight."

No a-priori information about X is\navailable at the encoder, which must therefore adopt a universal\ndata-compression algorithm. It is known that if the universal LZ77 data\ncompression algorithm is successively applied to N-blocks then the best\nerror-free compression for the particular individual sequence X is achieved, as\n$N$ tends to infinity. The best possible compression that may be achieved by\nany universal data compression algorithm for finite N-blocks is discussed. It\nis demonstrated that context tree coding essentially achieves it. Next,\nconsider a device called classifier (or discriminator) that observes an\nindividual training sequence X. The classifier's task is to examine individual\ntest sequences of length N and decide whether the test N-sequence has the same\nfeatures as those that are captured by the training sequence X, or is\nsufficiently different, according to some appropriatecriterion. Here again, it\nis demonstrated that a particular universal context classifier with a\nstorage-space complexity that is linear in N, is essentially optimal.

This strategy is used to illustrate the deaf helper phenomenon,\nwhere the relay is able to facilitate secure communications while being totally\nignorant of the transmitted messages. Furthermore, NF is shown to increase the\nsecrecy capacity in the reversely degraded scenario, where the relay node fails\nto offer performance gains in the classical setting.

    "summary": "This paper presents an algebraic theory of linear signal processing. At the\ncore of algebraic signal processing is the concept of a linear signal model\ndefined as a triple (A, M, phi), where familiar concepts like the filter space\nand the signal space are cast as an algebra A and a module M, respectively, and\nphi generalizes the concept of the z-transform to bijective linear mappings\nfrom a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into the module M. A signal model\nprovides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application,\nsuch as infinite and finite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete\nspace, or the various forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As\nsoon as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, including the\nassociated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift\noperator is a key concept in the algebraic theory: it is the generator of the\nalgebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology\nleads to the associated signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite\nand finite time models with associated infinite and finite z-transforms, and to\ninfinite and finite space models with associated infinite and finite\nC-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete\ncosine and sine transforms are Fourier transforms for the finite space models.\nOther definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new\ntransforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions,\nseparable and non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance\n(the algebra of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and\nsignal extensions, the connections between linear transforms and linear finite\nGauss-Markov fields, and several other concepts and connections."

In CDMA signature optimization, for a particular user, the\nreceiver selects a signature vector from a codebook to best avoid interference\nfrom other users, and then feeds the corresponding index back to the specified\nuser. For MIMO beamforming vector selection, the receiver chooses a beamforming\nvector from a given codebook to maximize throughput, and feeds back the\ncorresponding index to the transmitter. These two problems are dual: both can\nbe modeled as selecting a unit norm vector from a finite size codebook to\n\"match\" a randomly generated Gaussian matrix. In signature optimization, the\nleast match is required while the maximum match is preferred for beamforming\nselection.\n  Assuming that the feedback link is rate limited, our main result is an exact\nasymptotic performance formulae where the length of the signature/beamforming\nvector, the dimensions of interference/channel matrix, and the feedback rate\napproach infinity with constant ratios. The proof rests on a large deviation\nprinciple over a random matrix ensemble.

    "summary": "In this contribution, models of wireless channels are derived from the\nmaximum entropy principle, for several cases where only limited information\nabout the propagation environment is available. First, analytical models are\nderived for the cases where certain parameters (channel energy, average energy,\nspatial correlation matrix) are known deterministically. Frequently, these\nparameters are unknown (typically because the received energy or the spatial\ncorrelation varies with the user position), but still known to represent\nmeaningful system characteristics. In these cases, analytical channel models\nare derived by assigning entropy-maximizing distributions to these parameters,\nand marginalizing them out. For the MIMO case with spatial correlation, we show\nthat the distribution of the covariance matrices is conveniently handled\nthrough its eigenvalues. The entropy-maximizing distribution of the covariance\nmatrix is shown to be a Wishart distribution. Furthermore, the corresponding\nprobability density function of the channel matrix is shown to be described\nanalytically by a function of the channel Frobenius norm. This technique can\nprovide channel models incorporating the effect of shadow fading and spatial\ncorrelation between antennas without the need to assume explicit values for\nthese parameters. The results are compared in terms of mutual information to\nthe classical i.i.d. Gaussian model."

    "summary": "In this correspondence the cumulants of the mutual information of the flat\nRayleigh fading amplify-and-forward MIMO relay channel without direct link\nbetween source and destination are derived in the large array limit. The\nanalysis is based on the replica trick and covers both spatially independent\nand correlated fading in the first and the second hop, while beamforming at all\nterminals is restricted to deterministic weight matrices. Expressions for mean\nand variance of the mutual information are obtained. Their parameters are\ndetermined by a nonlinear equation system. All higher cumulants are shown to\nvanish as the number of antennas n goes to infinity. In conclusion the\ndistribution of the mutual information I becomes Gaussian in the large n limit\nand is completely characterized by the expressions obtained for mean and\nvariance of I. Comparisons with simulation results show that the asymptotic\nresults serve as excellent approximations for systems with only few antennas at\neach node. The derivation of the results follows the technique formalized by\nMoustakas et al. in [1]. Although the evaluations are more involved for the\nMIMO relay channel compared to point-to-point MIMO channels, the structure of\nthe results is surprisingly simple again. In particular an elegant formula for\nthe mean of the mutual information is obtained, i.e., the ergodic capacity of\nthe two-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay channel without direct link."

    "summary": "This paper considers the design of relay assisted F/TDMA ad hoc networks with\nmultiple relay nodes each of which assists the transmission of a predefined\nsubset of source nodes to their respective destinations. Considering the sum\ncapacity as the performance metric, we solve the problem of optimally\nallocating the total power of each relay node between the transmissions it is\nassisting. We consider four different relay transmission strategies, namely\nregenerative decode-and-forward (RDF), nonregenerative decode-and-forward\n(NDF), amplify-and-forward (AF) and compress-and-forward (CF). We first obtain\nthe optimum power allocation policies for the relay nodes that employ a uniform\nrelaying strategy for all nodes. We show that the optimum power allocation for\nthe RDF and NDF cases are modified water-filling solutions. We observe that for\na given relay transmit power, NDF always outperforms RDF whereas CF always\nprovides higher sum capacity than AF. When CF and NDF are compared, it is\nobserved that either of CF or NDF may outperform the other in different\nscenarios. This observation suggests that the sum capacity can be further\nimproved by having each relay adopt its relaying strategy in helping different\nsource nodes. We investigate this problem next and determine the optimum power\nallocation and relaying strategy for each source node that relay nodes assist.\nWe observe that optimum power allocation for relay nodes with hybrid relaying\nstrategies provides higher sum capacity than pure RDF, NDF, AF or CF relaying\nstrategies."

It is shown that such a design can\neffectively harness diversity advantage of the relay channel in both high-rate\nand low-rate scenarios. When the rate requirement is low, the proposed design\ngives a second-order outage diversity performance approaching that of\nfull-duplex relaying. When the rate requirement becomes asymptotically large,\nthe design still gives a close-to-second-order outage diversity performance.\nThe design also achieves the best diversity-multiplexing tradeoff possible for\nthe relay channel. With optimal long-term power control over the fading relay\nchannel, the proposed design achieves a delay-limited rate performance that is\nonly 3.0dB (5.4dB) worse than the capacity performance of the additive white\nGaussian channel in low- (high-) rate scenarios."

Also, the interaction between two communicating parties is\nwell-known to reduce the communication complexity. This paper proposes a\nformalism that exploits these two opportunities to reduce the number of bits\ntransmitted by a sensor node in a cluster, hence enhancing its lifetime. We\nargue that our approach has several inherent advantages in scenarios where the\nsensor nodes are acutely energy and computing-power constrained, but the\nbase-station is not so. This provides us an opportunity to develop\ncommunication protocols, where most of the computing and communication is done\nby the base-station.\n  The proposed framework casts the sensor nodes and base-station communication\nproblem as the problem of multiple informants with correlated information\ncommunicating with a recipient and attempts to extend extant work on\ninteractive communication between an informant-recipient pair to such\nscenarios. Our work makes four major contributions. Firstly, we explicitly show\nthat in such scenarios interaction can help in reducing the communication\ncomplexity. Secondly, we show that the order in which the informants\ncommunicate with the recipient may determine the communication complexity.\nThirdly, we provide the framework to compute the $m$-message communication\ncomplexity in such scenarios. Lastly, we prove that in a typical sensor network\nscenario, the proposed formalism significantly reduces the communication and\ncomputational complexities."

    "summary": "We consider a single-hop data gathering sensor cluster consisting of a set of\nsensors that need to transmit data periodically to a base-station. We are\ninterested in maximizing the lifetime of this network. Even though the setting\nof our problem is very simple, it turns out that the solution is far from easy.\nThe complexity arises from several competing system-level opportunities\navailable to reduce the energy consumed in radio transmission. First, sensor\ndata is spatially and temporally correlated. Recent advances in distributed\nsource-coding allow us to take advantage of these correlations to reduce the\nnumber of transmitted bits, with concomitant savings in energy. Second, it is\nalso well-known that channel-coding can be used to reduce transmission energy\nby increasing transmission time. Finally, sensor nodes are cooperative, unlike\nnodes in an ad hoc network that are often modeled as competitive, allowing us\nto take full advantage of the first two opportunities for the purpose of\nmaximizing cluster lifetime. In this paper, we pose the problem of maximizing\nlifetime as a max-min optimization problem subject to the constraint of\nsuccessful data collection and limited energy supply at each node. By\nintroducing the notion of instantaneous decoding, we are able to simplify this\noptimization problem into a joint scheduling and time allocation problem. We\nshow that even with our ample simplification, the problem remains NP-hard. We\nprovide some algorithms, heuristics and insight for various scenarios. Our\nchief contribution is to illustrate both the challenges and gains provided by\njoint source-channel coding and scheduling."

Analysis of the\nprotocol reveals that it uniformly dominates the compress-forward strategy and\nfurther outperforms the dynamic decode-forward protocol at high multiplexing\ngains. An interesting feature of the proposed protocol is that, at high\nmultiplexing gains, it resembles a multiple-input single-output system, and at\nlow multiplexing gains, it provides each user with the same\ndiversity-multiplexing trade-off as if there is no contention for the relay\nfrom the other users."

    "summary": "In recent years, network coding has been investigated as a method to obtain\nimprovements in wireless networks. A typical assumption of previous work is\nthat relay nodes performing network coding can decode the messages from sources\nperfectly. On a simple relay network, we design a scheme to obtain network\ncoding gain even when the relay node cannot perfectly decode its received\nmessages. In our scheme, the operation at the relay node resembles message\npassing in belief propagation, sending the logarithm likelihood ratio (LLR) of\nthe network coded message to the destination. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe gain obtained over different channel conditions. The goal of this paper is\nnot to give a theoretical result, but to point to possible interaction of\nnetwork coding with user cooperation in noisy scenario. The extrinsic\ninformation transfer (EXIT) chart is shown to be a useful engineering tool to\nanalyze the performance of joint channel coding and network coding in the\nnetwork."

Our analytical results indicate that the required\nearly elimination window for negligible performance degradation is just twice\nof the constraint length for rate one-half convolutional codes. For rate\none-third convolutional codes, the required early-elimination window even\nreduces to the constraint length. The suggestive theoretical level thresholds\nalmost coincide with the simulation results. As a consequence of the small\nearly-elimination window required for near maximum-likelihood performance, the\nMLSDA with early-elimination modification rules out considerable computational\nburdens, as well as memory requirement, by directly eliminating a big number of\nthe top paths, which makes the MLSDA with early elimination very suitable for\napplications that dictate a low-complexity software implementation with near\nmaximum-likelihood performance."

    "summary": "In this paper, we obtain the scaling laws of the sum-rate capacity of a MIMO\nX-channel, a 2 independent sender, 2 independent receiver channel with messages\nfrom each transmitter to each receiver, at high signal to noise ratios (SNR).\nThe X-channel has sparked recent interest in the context of cooperative\nnetworks and it encompasses the interference, multiple access, and broadcast\nchannels as special cases. Here, we consider the case with partially\ncooperative transmitters in which only partial and asymmetric side-information\nis available at one of the transmitters. It is proved that when there are M\nantennas at all four nodes, the sum-rate scales like 2Mlog(SNR) which is in\nsharp contrast to [\\lfloor 4M/3 \\rfloor,4M/3]log(SNR) for non-cooperative\nX-channels \\cite{maddah-ali,jafar_degrees}. This further proves that, in terms\nof sum-rate scaling at high SNR, partial side-information at one of the\ntransmitters and full side-information at both transmitters are equivalent in\nthe MIMO X-channel."

    "summary": "A network of $n$ wireless communication links is considered. Fading is\nassumed to be the dominant factor affecting the strength of the channels\nbetween nodes. The objective is to analyze the achievable throughput of the\nnetwork when power allocation is allowed. By proposing a decentralized on-off\npower allocation strategy, a lower bound on the achievable throughput is\nobtained for a general fading model. In particular, under Rayleigh fading\nconditions the achieved sum-rate is of order $\\log n$, which is, by a constant\nfactor, larger than what is obtained with a centralized scheme in the work of\nGowaikar et al. Similar to most of previous works on large networks, the\nproposed scheme assigns a vanishingly small rate for each link. However, it is\nshown that by allowing the sum-rate to decrease by a factor $\\alpha<1$, this\nscheme is capable of providing non-zero rate-per-links of order $\\Theta(1)$. To\nobtain larger non-zero rate-per-links, the proposed scheme is modified to a\ncentralized version. It turns out that for the same number of active links the\ncentralized scheme achieves a much larger rate-per-link. Moreover, at large\nvalues of rate-per-link, it achieves a sum-rate close to $\\log n$, i.e., the\nmaximum achieved by the decentralized scheme."

First, we show that a\nvery simple feedback-dependent Gauss-Markov source achieves the feedback\ncapacity, and that Kalman-Bucy filtering is optimal for processing the\nfeedback. Based on these results, we develop a new method for optimizing the\nchannel inputs for achieving the Cover-Pombra block-length-$n$ feedback\ncapacity by using a dynamic programming approach that decomposes the\ncomputation into $n$ sequentially identical optimization problems where each\nstage involves optimizing $O(L^2)$ variables. Second, we derive the explicit\nmaximal information rate for stationary feedback-dependent sources. In general,\nevaluating the maximal information rate for stationary sources requires solving\nonly a few equations by simple non-linear programming. For first-order\nautoregressive and/or moving average (ARMA) noise channels, this optimization\nadmits a closed form maximal information rate formula. The maximal information\nrate for stationary sources is a lower bound on the feedback capacity, and it\nequals the feedback capacity if the long-standing conjecture, that stationary\nsources achieve the feedback capacity, holds."

Under\nquasi-static phase fading, when all nodes have equal average transmit power\nalong with full channel state information (CSI), it is shown that transmitter\ncooperation outperforms receiver cooperation, whereas the opposite is true when\npower is optimally allocated among the cooperating nodes but only CSI at the\nreceiver (CSIR) is available. When the nodes have equal power with CSIR only,\ncooperative schemes are shown to offer no capacity improvement over\nnon-cooperation under the same network power constraint. When the system is\nunder optimal power allocation with full CSI, the decode-and-forward\ntransmitter cooperation rate is close to its cut-set capacity upper bound, and\noutperforms compress-and-forward receiver cooperation. Under fast Rayleigh\nfading in the high SNR regime, similar conclusions follow. Cooperative systems\nprovide resilience to fading in channel magnitudes; however, capacity becomes\nmore sensitive to power allocation, and the cooperating nodes need to be closer\ntogether for the decode-and-forward scheme to be capacity-achieving. Moreover,\nto realize capacity improvement, full CSI is necessary in transmitter\ncooperation, while in receiver cooperation optimal power allocation is\nessential."

Lacking is a measure to\nquantify this advantage and to compare directional antennas of different\nfootprint patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam\nwidth (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which\nquantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional\nantennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread\nwithin which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In\ncontrast, our effective beam width definition lumps the effects of the (i)\nantenna pattern, (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel\ncharacteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We\ninvestigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show\nhow the convenience afforded by these properties can be used to analyze the\neffectiveness of complex directional antenna patterns in boosting network\ncapacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account. In\nparticular, we derive the extent to which network capacity can be scaled with\nthe use of phased array antennas.

    "summary": "Motivated by video coding applications, the problem of sequential coding of\ncorrelated sources with encoding and/or decoding frame-delays is studied. The\nfundamental tradeoffs between individual frame rates, individual frame\ndistortions, and encoding/decoding frame-delays are derived in terms of a\nsingle-letter information-theoretic characterization of the rate-distortion\nregion for general inter-frame source correlations and certain types of\npotentially frame specific and coupled single-letter fidelity criteria. The\nsum-rate-distortion region is characterized in terms of generalized directed\ninformation measures highlighting their role in delayed sequential source\ncoding problems. For video sources which are spatially stationary memoryless\nand temporally Gauss-Markov, MSE frame distortions, and a sum-rate constraint,\nour results expose the optimality of idealized differential predictive coding\namong all causal sequential coders, when the encoder uses a positive rate to\ndescribe each frame. Somewhat surprisingly, causal sequential encoding with\none-frame-delayed noncausal sequential decoding can exactly match the\nsum-rate-MSE performance of joint coding for all nontrivial MSE-tuples\nsatisfying certain positive semi-definiteness conditions. Thus, even a single\nframe-delay holds potential for yielding significant performance improvements.\nGeneralizations to higher order Markov sources are also presented and\ndiscussed. A rate-distortion performance equivalence between, causal sequential\nencoding with delayed noncausal sequential decoding, and, delayed noncausal\nsequential encoding with causal sequential decoding, is also established."

However, the ML\ndecoding complexity of STBCs becomes prohibitive large as the number of\ntransmit and receive antennas increase. Hence it is natural to resort to a\nsuboptimal reception technique like linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)\nreceiver. Barbarossa et al and Liu et al have independently derived necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a full rate linear STBC to be MMSE optimal, i.e\nachieve least Symbol Error Rate (SER). Motivated by this problem, certain\nexisting high rate STBC constructions from crossed product algebras are\nidentified to be MMSE optimal. Also, it is shown that a certain class of codes\nfrom cyclic division algebras which are special cases of crossed product\nalgebras are MMSE optimal. Hence, these STBCs achieve least SER when MMSE\nreception is employed and are fully diverse when ML reception is employed."

However, there are SSD codes that\nare not obtainable from ODs and DSD codes that are not obtainable from QODs. In\nthis paper a method of constructing $g$-symbol decodable ($g$-SD) STBCs using\nrepresentations of Clifford algebras are presented which when specialized to\n$g=1,2$ gives SSD and DSD codes respectively. For the number of transmit\nantennas $2^a$ the rate (in complex symbols per channel use) of the $g$-SD\ncodes presented in this paper is $\\frac{a+1-g}{2^{a-g}}$. The maximum rate of\nthe DSD STBCs from QODs reported in the literature is $\\frac{a}{2^{a-1}}$ which\nis smaller than the rate $\\frac{a-1}{2^{a-2}}$ of the DSD codes of this paper,\nfor $2^a$ transmit antennas.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the\ndesign and deployment of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total\nsystem bandwidth of W Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each\ntransmission, how many frequency slots N of size W/N should the band be\npartitioned into to maximize the number of simultaneous transmissions in the\nnetwork? In an interference-limited ad-hoc network, dividing the available\nspectrum results in two competing effects: on the positive side, it reduces the\nnumber of users on each band and therefore decreases the interference level\nwhich leads to an increased SINR, while on the negative side the SINR\nrequirement for each transmission is increased because the same information\nrate must be achieved over a smaller bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff between\nbandwidth and SINR and determining the optimum value of N in terms of the\nsystem parameters is the focus of the paper. Using stochastic geometry, we\nanalytically derive the optimal SINR threshold (which directly corresponds to\nthe optimal spectral efficiency) on this tradeoff curve and show that it is a\nfunction of only the path loss exponent. Furthermore, the optimal SINR point\nlies between the low-SINR (power-limited) and high-SINR (bandwidth-limited)\nregimes. In order to operate at this optimal point, the number of frequency\nbands (i.e., the reuse factor) should be increased until the threshold SINR,\nwhich is an increasing function of the reuse factor, is equal to the optimal\nvalue."

    "summary": "This work is devoted to practical joint source channel coding. Although the\nproposed approach has more general scope, for the sake of clarity we focus on a\nspecific application example, namely, the transmission of digital images over\nnoisy binary-input output-symmetric channels. The basic building blocks of most\nstate-of the art source coders are: 1) a linear transformation; 2) scalar\nquantization of the transform coefficients; 3) probability modeling of the\nsequence of quantization indices; 4) an entropy coding stage. We identify the\nweakness of the conventional separated source-channel coding approach in the\ncatastrophic behavior of the entropy coding stage. Hence, we replace this stage\nwith linear coding, that maps directly the sequence of redundant quantizer\noutput symbols into a channel codeword. We show that this approach does not\nentail any loss of optimality in the asymptotic regime of large block length.\nHowever, in the practical regime of finite block length and low decoding\ncomplexity our approach yields very significant improvements. Furthermore, our\nscheme allows to retain the transform, quantization and probability modeling of\ncurrent state-of the art source coders, that are carefully matched to the\nfeatures of specific classes of sources. In our working example, we make use of\n``bit-planes'' and ``contexts'' model defined by the JPEG2000 standard and we\nre-interpret the underlying probability model as a sequence of conditionally\nMarkov sources. The Markov structure allows to derive a simple successive\ncoding and decoding scheme, where the latter is based on iterative Belief\nPropagation. We provide a construction example of the proposed scheme based on\npunctured Turbo Codes and we demonstrate the gain over a conventional separated\nscheme by running extensive numerical experiments on test images."

    "summary": "Wyner's wiretap channel is extended to parallel broadcast channels and fading\nchannels with multiple receivers. In the first part of the paper, we consider\nthe setup of parallel broadcast channels with one sender, multiple intended\nreceivers, and one eavesdropper. We study the situations where the sender\nbroadcasts either a common message or independent messages to the intended\nreceivers. We derive upper and lower bounds on the common-message-secrecy\ncapacity, which coincide when the users are reversely degraded. For the case of\nindependent messages we establish the secrecy sum-capacity when the users are\nreversely degraded.\n  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to fading channels:\nperfect channel state information of all intended receivers is known globally,\nwhereas the eavesdropper channel is known only to her. For the common message\ncase, a somewhat surprising result is proven: a positive rate can be achieved\nindependently of the number of intended receivers. For independent messages, an\nopportunistic transmission scheme is presented that achieves the secrecy\nsum-capacity in the limit of large number of receivers. Our results are stated\nfor a fast fading channel model. Extensions to the block fading model are also\ndiscussed."

    "summary": "We study information-theoretic security for discrete memoryless interference\nand broadcast channels with independent confidential messages sent to two\nreceivers. Confidential messages are transmitted to their respective receivers\nwith information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each receiver is kept in total\nignorance with respect to the message intended for the other receiver. The\nsecrecy level is measured by the equivocation rate at the eavesdropping\nreceiver. In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on secrecy capacity\nregions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an\nidentical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models.\nThe difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is\noptimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning\ntechniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows\nfor both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show\nthat, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch\nchannel, the two bound bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission\nschemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate\nregions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy. An encoding scheme\nin which transmitters dedicate some of their power to create artificial noise\nis proposed and shown to outperform both time-sharing and simple multiplexed\ntransmission of the confidential messages."

One expects that if the actual input is simple enough, then MKCS will\nrecover the input exactly. This paper presents a preliminary study of the\nexistence and value of the complexity level up to which such a complexity-based\nrecovery is possible. It is shown that for the set of all d*n binary matrices\n(with entries 0 or 1 and d<n), MKCS exactly recovers the input for an\noverwhelming fraction of the matrices provided the Kolmogorov complexity of the\ninput is O(d).

A\nminimax formulation is adopted to attain robustness. First, a class of\nachievable rates per unit cost (ARPUC) is derived, and its utility is\ndemonstrated through several representative case studies. Second, when the\nuncertainty set of channel transition statistics satisfies a convexity\nproperty, optimization is performed over the class of ARPUC through utilizing\nresults of minimax robustness. The resulting CPUC lower bound indicates the\nultimate performance of the orthogonal coding scheme, and coincides with the\nCPUC under certain restrictive conditions.

    "summary": "Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are usually decoded by running an\niterative belief-propagation, or message-passing, algorithm over the factor\ngraph of the code. The traditional message-passing schedule consists of\nupdating all the variable nodes in the graph, using the same pre-update\ninformation, followed by updating all the check nodes of the graph, again,\nusing the same pre-update information. Recently several studies show that\nsequential scheduling, in which messages are generated using the latest\navailable information, significantly improves the convergence speed in terms of\nnumber of iterations. Sequential scheduling raises the problem of finding the\nbest sequence of message updates. This paper presents practical scheduling\nstrategies that use the value of the messages in the graph to find the next\nmessage to be updated. Simulation results show that these informed update\nsequences require significantly fewer iterations than standard sequential\nschedules. Furthermore, the paper shows that informed scheduling solves some\nstandard trapping set errors. Therefore, it also outperforms traditional\nscheduling for a large numbers of iterations. Complexity and implementability\nissues are also addressed."

The computational complexity of this shift-register based algorithm\nis of the same order as the complexity of the well-known Berlekamp-Massey\nalgorithm. Moreover, the error correcting radius coincides with the error\ncorrecting radius of the original Sudan algorithm, and the practical decoding\nperformance observed on a q-ary symmetric channel (QSC) is virtually identical\nto the decoding performance of the Sudan algorithm. Bounds for the failure and\nerror probability as well as for the QSC decoding performance of the new\nalgorithm are derived, and the performance is illustrated by means of examples."

In this paper, we show that exact ML decoding of a\nclasss of asymptotically good error correcting codes--expander codes, a special\ncase of low density parity check (LDPC) codes--over binary symmetric channels\n(BSCs) is possible with an expected polynomial complexity. More precisely, for\nany bit-flipping probability, $p$, in a nontrivial range, there exists a rate\nregion of non-zero support and a family of asymptotically good codes, whose\nerror probability decays exponentially in coding length $n$, for which ML\ndecoding is feasible in expected polynomial time. Furthermore, as $p$\napproaches zero, this rate region approaches the channel capacity region. The\nresult is based on the existence of polynomial-time suboptimal decoding\nalgorithms that provide an ML certificate and the ability to compute the\nprobability that the suboptimal decoder yields the ML solution. One such ML\ncertificate decoder is the LP decoder of Feldman; we also propose a more\nefficient $O(n^2)$ algorithm based on the work of Sipser and Spielman and the\nFord-Fulkerson algorithm. The results can be extended to AWGN channels and\nsuggest that it may be feasible to eliminate the error floor phenomenon\nassociated with message-passage decoding of LDPC codes in the high SNR regime.\nFinally, we observe that the argument of Berlekamp, McEliece and van Tilborg\ncan be used to show that ML decoding of the considered class of codes\nconstructed from LDPC codes with regular left degree, of which the considered\nexpander codes are a special case, remains NP-hard; thus giving an interesting\ncontrast between the worst-case and expected complexities."

In the latter two protocols the\ninner and outer bounds are not identical, and differ in a manner similar to the\ninner and outer bounds of Cover's relay channel.

    "summary": "For a multiple antenna system, we compute the asymptotic distribution of\nantenna selection gain when the transmitter selects the transmit antenna with\nthe strongest channel. We use this to asymptotically estimate the underlying\nchannel capacity distributions, and demonstrate that unlike\nmultiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the channel for antenna\nselection systems hardens at a slower rate, and thus a significant multiuser\nscheduling gain can exist - O(1/ log m) for channel selection as opposed to\nO(1/ sqrt{m}) for MIMO, where m is the number of transmit antennas.\nAdditionally, even without this scheduling gain, it is demonstrated that\ntransmit antenna selection systems outperform open loop MIMO systems in low\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) regimes, particularly for a\nsmall number of receive antennas. This may have some implications on wireless\nsystem design, because most of the users in modern wireless systems have low\nSINRs"

    "summary": "We consider the problem of joint source-channel coding for transmitting K\nsamples of a complex Gaussian source over T = bK uses of a block-fading\nmultiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel with M transmit and N receive\nantennas. We consider the case when we are allowed to code over L blocks. The\nchannel gain is assumed to be constant over a block and channel gains for\ndifferent blocks are assumed to be independent. The performance measure of\ninterest is the rate of decay of the expected mean squared error with the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), called the distortion SNR exponent. We first show\nthat using a broadcast strategy of Gunduz and Erkip, but with a different power\nand rate allocation policy, the optimal distortion SNR exponent can be achieved\nfor bandwidth efficiencies 0 < b < (|N-M|+1)/min(M,N). This is the first time\nthe optimal exponent is characterized for 1/min(M,N) < b < (|N-M |+ 1)/ min(M,\nN). Also, for b > MNL^2, we show that the broadcast scheme achieves the optimal\nexponent of MNL. Special cases of this result have been derived for the L=1\ncase and for M=N=1 by Gunduz and Erkip. We then propose a digital layered\ntransmission scheme that uses both time layering and superposition. This\nincludes many previously known schemes as special cases. The proposed scheme is\nat least as good as the currently best known schemes for the entire range of\nbandwidth efficiencies, whereas at least for some M, N, and b, it is strictly\nbetter than the currently best known schemes."

    "summary": "In distributed detection systems with wireless sensor networks, the\ncommunication between sensors and a fusion center is not perfect due to\ninterference and limited transmitter power at the sensors to combat noise at\nthe fusion center's receiver. The problem of optimizing detection performance\nwith such imperfect communication brings a new challenge to distributed\ndetection. In this paper, sensors are assumed to have independent but\nnonidentically distributed observations, and a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)\nchannel model is included to account for imperfect communication between the\nsensors and the fusion center. The J-divergence between the distributions of\nthe detection statistic under different hypotheses is used as a performance\ncriterion in order to provide a tractable analysis. Optimizing the performance\n(in terms of the J-divergence) with individual and total transmitter power\nconstraints on the sensors is studied, and the corresponding power allocation\nscheme is provided. It is interesting to see that the proposed power allocation\nis a tradeoff between two factors, the communication channel quality and the\nlocal decision quality. For the case with orthogonal channels under certain\nconditions, the power allocation can be solved by a weighted water-filling\nalgorithm. Simulations show that, to achieve the same performance, the proposed\npower allocation in certain cases only consumes as little as 25 percent of the\ntotal power used by an equal power allocation scheme."

Discovering lower\nbounds on the amount of protocol overhead incurred for routing data packets is\nimportant for the development of efficient routing protocols, and for\ncharacterizing the actual (effective) capacity available for network users.\nThis paper presents an information-theoretic framework for characterizing the\nminimum routing overheads of geographic routing in a network with mobile nodes.\nspecifically, the minimum overhead problem is formulated as a rate-distortion\nproblem. The formulation may be applied to networks with arbitrary traffic\narrival and location service schemes. Lower bounds are derived for the minimum\noverheads incurred for maintaining the location of destination nodes and\nconsistent neighborhood information in terms of node mobility and packet\narrival process.

For the design\nof pragmatic space-time codes a methodology is proposed and applied, based on\nthe extension of the concept of generalized transfer function for convolutional\ncodes over block fading channels. Our search algorithm produces the\nconvolutional encoder generators of pragmatic space-time codes for various\nnumber of states, number of antennas and fading rate. Finally it is shown that,\nfor the investigated cases, the performance of pragmatic space-time codes is\nbetter than that of previously known space-time codes, confirming that they are\na valuable choice in terms of both implementation complexity and performance."

    "summary": "In this paper, a downlink communication system, in which a Base Station (BS)\nequipped with M antennas communicates with N users each equipped with K receive\nantennas ($K \\leq M$), is considered. It is assumed that the receivers have\nperfect Channel State Information (CSI), while the BS only knows the partial\nCSI, provided by the receivers via feedback. The minimum amount of feedback\nrequired at the BS, to achieve the maximum sum-rate capacity in the asymptotic\ncase of $N \\to \\infty$ and different ranges of SNR is studied. In the fixed and\nlow SNR regimes, it is demonstrated that to achieve the maximum sum-rate, an\ninfinite amount of feedback is required. Moreover, in order to reduce the gap\nto the optimum sum-rate to zero, in the fixed SNR regime, the minimum amount of\nfeedback scales as $\\theta(\\ln \\ln \\ln N)$, which is achievable by the Random\nBeam-Forming scheme proposed in [14]. In the high SNR regime, two cases are\nconsidered; in the case of $K < M$, it is proved that the minimum amount of\nfeedback bits to reduce the gap between the achievable sum-rate and the maximum\nsum-rate to zero grows logaritmically with SNR, which is achievable by the\n\"Generalized Random Beam-Forming\" scheme, proposed in [18]. In the case of $K =\nM$, it is shown that by using the Random Beam-Forming scheme and the total\namount of feedback not growing with SNR, the maximum sum-rate capacity is\nachieved."

Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback."

    "summary": "While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the\nbasic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy\npower inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs\nof the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher\ninformation or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de\nBruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these\nproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing\nargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an\nintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these\ningredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual\ninformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information\ninequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used in\nearlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it\nrelies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then\ngeneralized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's\ngeneralized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and\nJohnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's\ncovariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy\npower."

Our first pair of\ntheorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees\nremaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously\noptimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are\nperformed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we\nprove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the\nrate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel\ncoding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the\ncapacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our\ncompound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve\nthe Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as\nthe Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).\nAlthough the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the\nproposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them\nwell-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures."

    "summary": "In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal\ncontains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch\nbetween the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a\ntime-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated\nat the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind\nCFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal\nis over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system\nestimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled\nversions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a\ndistinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO\ncan be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated\nMIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to\ninitialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually\nlinked with PLL."

    "summary": "We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive\ntransmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of\nmultiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by\nthe cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be\nfrom a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are\nconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter\nuses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded\ndistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power\naccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive\ntransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable\nfor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,\nwith path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly\nwith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary\nexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this\nradius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the\ndesign of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive\nusers may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary\nspectrum access using single-hop transmission is promising."

    "summary": "A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired\nnetwork is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may\nreach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other\nnodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based\nnetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for\nboosting network capacity."

The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large."

In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative\nbeamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main\nlobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces\nsignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same\ninformation.

Collisions, when they\noccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second\nphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and\nbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This\nstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex\nnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which\nenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.\nThe scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network\ncoordinates.

    "summary": "In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay\nchannel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are\ninterested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve\nthe highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds\noptimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case,\nwe propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route\nwith high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal)\nDF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme\nusing low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental\nredundancy."

Without the restriction to group codes rather than\nsubsets of group codes, arbitrary rates are achievable.

    "summary": "This work examines the problem of sequential detection of a change in the\ndrift of a Brownian motion in the case of two-sided alternatives. Applications\nto real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.\nTraditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to\ntheir asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms\ntends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic\nmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this\npaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general\n2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and\nlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change\nof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these\nexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.\nUsing these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with\nrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the\nexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case\nof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a\nstrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small\nvalues of the mean time between false alarms. We conclude with a discussion on\nthe open problem of strict optimality in the case of two-sided alternatives."

    "summary": "In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, applications of a\nrepeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the\nnetwork performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such\nnetworks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on\nthem. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To\novercome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in\nwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone\nnodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing\nto forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is\nstudied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the\nmin-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley\nfunction are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated\ngames and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and\nbackbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairness\ncriteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about\n50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes."

However, due to low\nspectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential\nfor use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of\nmultiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission\nprotocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are\ndeveloped. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In\naddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network\ncoding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be\nobtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.\n  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed\nprotocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and\nlower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative\ntransmission protocols."

    "summary": "Distributed estimation based on measurements from multiple wireless sensors\nis investigated. It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same\nquantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different\nvariances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog)\ntransmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a\nfusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed\nquantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by\nthe fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,\nwhere the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of\nestimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an\nachievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal\npower allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum\ndistortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion\nconstraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,\ni.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power\ngain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive\npower gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input\nSingle-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to\nthe transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under\nzero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy\nefficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed."

The effects of multiple-access\ninterference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters\nare explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario is\nconsidered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse\nradio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed.

    "summary": "In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of\nsensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR\nregime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing\ncapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random\nsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location\nsampling (coverage)."

    "summary": "A game-theoretic model is proposed to study the cross-layer problem of joint\npower and rate control with quality of service (QoS) constraints in\nmultiple-access networks. In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its\ntransmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own\nutility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The user's QoS constraints are\nspecified in terms of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average\ndelay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays. The\nutility function considered here measures energy efficiency and is particularly\nsuitable for wireless networks with energy constraints. The Nash equilibrium\nsolution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form\nexpression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown\nthat the QoS requirements of a user translate into a \"size\" for the user which\nis an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using\nthis competitive multiuser framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay,\nnetwork capacity and energy efficiency are studied. In addition, analytical\nexpressions are given for users' delay profiles and the delay performance of\nthe users at Nash equilibrium is quantified."

    "summary": "A unified approach to energy-efficient power control is proposed for\ncode-division multiple access (CDMA) networks. The approach is applicable to a\nlarge family of multiuser receivers including the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, and the\n(nonlinear) optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relationship that has\nbeen shown to exist between the transmit power and the output\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) in the large-system limit. It is\nshown that, for this family of receivers, when users seek to selfishly maximize\ntheir own energy efficiency, the Nash equilibrium is SIR-balanced. In addition,\na unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is\nproposed. The algorithm adjusts the user's transmit powers by iteratively\ncomputing the large-system multiuser efficiency, which is independent of\ninstantaneous spreading sequences. The convergence of the algorithm is proved\nfor the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is\ndemonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector. Moreover, the\nperformance of the algorithm in finite-size systems is studied and compared\nwith that of a conventional power control scheme, in which user powers depend\non the instantaneous spreading sequences."

    "summary": "In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels\nin which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent\nrelaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels."

It is shown that bit\nenergy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum\nbit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not\noperate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the\nsnr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated.

For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)\ndetection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are\nobtained.

The complexity of analyzing general Markov channels is\nmitigated by this ordering, since it is possible to immediately determine that\na wide class of channels, with different numbers of states, has a smaller\nmutual information than a given channel."

    "summary": "In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to\neavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have\nbecome critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper\nconsiders the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast\nchannel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential\nmessages to two users with perfect secrecy. That is, each user would like to\nobtain its own message reliably and confidentially. First, a computable\nSato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for a\nmulti-antenna broadcast channel with confidential messages. Next, a dirty-paper\nsecure coding scheme and its simplified version are described. For each case,\nthe corresponding achievable rate region is derived under the perfect secrecy\nrequirement. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that the Sato-type\nouter bound is consistent with the boundary of the simplified dirty-paper\ncoding secrecy rate region."

    "summary": "Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) presents a compact framework to compare\nvarious MIMO systems and channels in terms of the two main advantages they\nprovide (i.e. high data rate and/or low error rate). This tradeoff was\ncharacterized asymptotically (SNR-> infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading\nchannel by Zheng and Tse [1]. The asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR\none [2]. In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in the\nnumber of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the\nfinite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).\nBased on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be\napproached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to\naffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is defined\nvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNR\nvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to\nestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain\ndefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results\nin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,\nhence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For this\ndefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number of\nantennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, the\ndiversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of the\nchannel. While the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse does not capture this\neffect, the size-asymptotic DMT does."

High-SNR approximations for optimized average block and total\nerror rates are given. The SNR gain of optimization is rigorously defined and\nstudied using analytical tools, including lower and upper bounds, high and low\nSNR approximations.

While the average\noptimization is less complex than the instantaneous one, its performance is\nalmost as good at high SNR. A measure of robustness of the optimized algorithm\nis introduced and evaluated. The optimized algorithm is shown to be robust to\nperturbations in individual and total transmit powers.

Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the\nthresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC\nensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More\nprecisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to\ncapacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the\ngap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).\n  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS\nalgorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant\n$1/\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was\nlesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.\nHowever, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates\nbetween 0.3 and 0.9.\n  We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open\nquestions related to the MS algorithm."

First, for\ngiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some\ncases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best\nknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,\nthe threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solved\nin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization\ntool.

We provide simulation\nresults demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed\ndistortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear\ndetectors.

Based on this volume formula, several\nbounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization\nrate is sufficiently high.

    "summary": "This paper studies the ergodic capacity of time- and frequency-selective\nmultipath fading channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime when training\nsignals are used for channel estimation at the receiver. Motivated by recent\nmeasurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath\nchannels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension\n(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the\nnumber of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a\ntraining and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal\nshort-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates\nsparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact\nof multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the\nwideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality\nconditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in\nspectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the\nimportance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,\nour results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The\ncoherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby\nsignificantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)\nSparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large\nbandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements\nfor first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling\nduration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is\neliminated or relaxed in sparse environments."

    "summary": "In contrast to the prevalent assumption of rich multipath in information\ntheoretic analysis of wireless channels, physical channels exhibit sparse\nmultipath, especially at large bandwidths. We propose a model for sparse\nmultipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on\nnon-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication\nof sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the\nchannel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath,\nscale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth\nproduct). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that\nuses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler\nmanifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity\nperspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between\ncoherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space\ndimension without the need for peaky signaling. From a reliability viewpoint,\nthere is a fundamental tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability that\ncan be optimized to maximize the error exponent at any rate by appropriately\nchoosing the signaling duration as a function of bandwidth."

The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The\nexpected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power\namong the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when\npower is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends\nonly on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is\nallocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex\nconstraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.\nIn the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion\nis given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of\nthe density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses\nper source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes\nexpected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.\nWhile expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter\n(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading\npaths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from\nCSIT, especially when b is large."

    "summary": "In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies\nwith time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus,\ntechniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also\nthat number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of\nthese techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD\nanalyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users\nis constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of\nusers entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly\npessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and\ndetection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one\nmay impair performance.\n  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem\nof identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a\nrandom-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the\nsystem. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we\nderive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters\ncomprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive\nBayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a\nposteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this\ndensity to derive optimum detectors. In this paper we restrict ourselves to\ninterferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we\nshall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters."

The decoding algorithm, called\ninterior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear\nvector channels include many practically important channels such as inter\nsymbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that\nthe maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be\nrelaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD\nproblem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization\ntechnique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate\nvariations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the\nconvex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a\nsearch point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a\nlow-density parity-check matrix. Compared with a convectional joint message\npassing decoder, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER\nperformance with less complexity in the case of partial response channels in\nmany cases."

The first one is used for deterministic HDS modeling,\nwhereas the second one can deal with HDS with nondeterministic behavior.\nKeywords: Hybrid dynamic systems; D-elementary hybrid Petri nets; Hybrid\nautomata; Controller synthesis"

Optimal power allocation\nschemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the\nliterature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is\ngiven by m times the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains\navailable by employing long-term power constraints. In particular, we analyze\nthe optimal long-term solution, showing that zero outage can be achieved\nprovided that the corresponding short-term SNR exponent with the same system\nparameters is strictly greater than one. Conversely, if the short-term SNR\nexponent is smaller than one, we show that zero outage cannot be achieved. In\nthis case, we derive the corresponding long-term SNR exponent as a function of\nthe Singleton bound. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the\ncomplexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We\ntherefore propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage\nprobability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability\nobtained by optimal schemes.

First, by searching into the family of nearest\nneighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded\nmodulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of\nthe transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. This\nmetric, for arbitrary memoryless channels, achieves the capacity of a composite\n(more noisy) channel. Next, according to the notion of estimation-induced\noutage capacity (EIO capacity) introduced in our previous work, we characterize\nmaximal achievable information rates associated to the proposed decoder. The\nperformance of the proposed decoding metric over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading\nMIMO channels is compared to both the classical mismatched maximum-likelihood\n(ML) decoder and the theoretical limits given by the EIO capacity (i.e. the\nbest decoder in presence of channel estimation errors).

In the first one, the peak power to average\npower ratio (PPAPR) of the input constellation is held fixed, while in the\nsecond problem, the peak power is fixed independently of the average power. In\nthe first PPAPR-constrained problem, the mutual information, which grows as\nO(SNR^2), is maximized up to second order in SNR. In the second\npeak-constrained problem, where the mutual information behaves as O(SNR), the\nstructure of constellations that are optimal up to first order, or\nequivalently, that minimize energy/bit, are explicitly characterized.\nFurthermore, among constellations that are first-order optimal, those that\nmaximize the mutual information up to second order, or equivalently, the\nwideband slope, are characterized. In both PPAPR-constrained and\npeak-constrained problems, the optimal constellations are obtained in\nclosed-form as solutions to non-convex optimizations, and interestingly, they\nare found to be identical.

    "summary": "While the best known outerbound for the K user interference channel states\nthat there cannot be more than K/2 degrees of freedom, it has been conjectured\nthat in general the constant interference channel with any number of users has\nonly one degree of freedom. In this paper, we explore the spatial degrees of\nfreedom per orthogonal time and frequency dimension for the K user wireless\ninterference channel where the channel coefficients take distinct values across\nfrequency slots but are fixed in time. We answer five closely related\nquestions. First, we show that K/2 degrees of freedom can be achieved by\nchannel design, i.e. if the nodes are allowed to choose the best constant,\nfinite and nonzero channel coefficient values. Second, we show that if channel\ncoefficients can not be controlled by the nodes but are selected by nature,\ni.e., randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the total number of\nspatial degrees of freedom for the K user interference channel is almost surely\nK/2 per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Thus, only half the spatial\ndegrees of freedom are lost due to distributed processing of transmitted and\nreceived signals on the interference channel. Third, we show that interference\nalignment and zero forcing suffice to achieve all the degrees of freedom in all\ncases. Fourth, we show that the degrees of freedom $D$ directly lead to an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity characterization of the form\n$C(SNR)=D\\log(1+SNR)+\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the multiple access channel, the\nbroadcast channel, the 2 user interference channel, the 2 user MIMO X channel\nand the 3 user interference channel with M>1 antennas at each node. Fifth, we\ncharacterize the degree of freedom benefits from cognitive sharing of messages\non the 3 user interference channel."

    "summary": "Multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) arise in a distributed antenna\nsystem, where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas. In\nsuch systems the received signal contains multiple CFOs due to mismatch between\nthe local oscillators of transmitters and receiver. This results in a\ntime-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated\nfor at the receiver before symbol recovery. This paper proposes a new approach\nfor blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is\nover-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system\nestimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to\nsubsequently transform the multiple CFOs estimation problem into many\nindependent single CFO estimation problems. Furthermore, an initial estimate of\nthe CFO is obtained from the phase of the MIMO system response. The Cramer-Rao\nLower bound is also derived, and the large sample performance of the proposed\nestimator is compared to the bound."

    "summary": "We consider a new approach to power control in decentralized wireless\nnetworks, termed fractional power control (FPC). Transmission power is chosen\nas the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constant\nbetween 0 and 1. The choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar cases\nof channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. Choosing s\nin (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to be\nevaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. We derive\nclosed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target SINR\nin a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resulting\ntransmission capacity, which is the number of users/m^2 that can achieve this\nSINR on average. Using these approximations, which are quite accurate over\ntypical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of 1/2\nminimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of the\nchannel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with a\nrelatively low density of interferers. We also show numerically that this\nchoice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters.\nIntuitively, s=1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while making\nsure they do not flood the network with interference."

    "summary": "Existing works on distributed consensus explore linear iterations based on\nreversible Markov chains, which contribute to the slow convergence of the\nalgorithms. It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive behavior of\nreversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix\nsubstantially faster than the original chains. In this paper, we investigate\nthe idea of accelerating distributed consensus via lifting Markov chains, and\npropose a class of Location-Aided Distributed Averaging (LADA) algorithms for\nwireless networks, where nodes' coarse location information is used to\nconstruct nonreversible chains that facilitate distributed computing and\ncooperative processing. First, two general pseudo-algorithms are presented to\nillustrate the notion of distributed averaging through chain-lifting. These\npseudo-algorithms are then respectively instantiated through one LADA algorithm\non grid networks, and one on general wireless networks. For a $k\\times k$ grid\nnetwork, the proposed LADA algorithm achieves an $\\epsilon$-averaging time of\n$O(k\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$. Based on this algorithm, in a wireless network with\ntransmission range $r$, an $\\epsilon$-averaging time of\n$O(r^{-1}\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ can be attained through a centralized algorithm.\nSubsequently, we present a fully-distributed LADA algorithm for wireless\nnetworks, which utilizes only the direction information of neighbors to\nconstruct nonreversible chains. It is shown that this distributed LADA\nalgorithm achieves the same scaling law in averaging time as the centralized\nscheme. Finally, we propose a cluster-based LADA (C-LADA) algorithm, which,\nrequiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of reduced\nmessage complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm."

Transmission by the primary user must be\ndetected reliably even in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and in the\nface of shadowing and fading. Communication signals are typically\ncyclostationary, and have many periodic statistical properties related to the\nsymbol rate, the coding and modulation schemes as well as the guard periods,\nfor example. These properties can be exploited in designing a detector, and for\ndistinguishing between the primary and secondary users' signals. In this paper,\na generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for detecting the presence of\ncyclostationarity using multiple cyclic frequencies is proposed. Distributed\ndecision making is employed by combining the quantized local test statistics\nfrom many secondary users. User cooperation allows for mitigating the effects\nof shadowing and provides a larger footprint for the cognitive radio system.\nSimulation examples demonstrate the resulting performance gains in the low SNR\nregime and the benefits of cooperative detection."

A central unit,\nhaving access to the data gathered by a dense network of fixed-precision\nsensors, operating under stringent inter-node communication constraints, is\nrequired to reconstruct the field snapshots to maximum accuracy. Both\ndeterministic and stochastic field models are considered. For stochastic\nfields, results are established in the almost-sure sense. The feasibility of\nhaving a flexible tradeoff between the oversampling rate (sensor density) and\nthe analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision, while achieving an exponential\naccuracy in the number of bits per Nyquist-interval per snapshot is\ndemonstrated. This exposes an underlying ``conservation of bits'' principle:\nthe bit-budget per Nyquist-interval per snapshot (the rate) can be distributed\nalong the amplitude axis (sensor-precision) and space (sensor density) in an\nalmost arbitrary discrete-valued manner, while retaining the same (exponential)\ndistortion-rate characteristics. Achievable information scaling laws for field\nreconstruction over a bounded region are also derived: With N one-bit sensors\nper Nyquist-interval, $\\Theta(\\log N)$ Nyquist-intervals, and total network\nbitrate $R_{net} = \\Theta((\\log N)^2)$ (per-sensor bitrate $\\Theta((\\log\nN)/N)$), the maximum pointwise distortion goes to zero as $D = O((\\log N)^2/N)$\nor $D = O(R_{net} 2^{-\\beta \\sqrt{R_{net}}})$.

In this\nwork we consider a parallel relay network with noise correlation. For the relay\nstrategy of amplify-and-forward (AF), we determine the optimal rate maximizing\nrelay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays. The effect\nof correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the\ncases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when\nthere is no knowledge about the correlation structure. Interestingly we find\nthat, on the average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the\nrelays know the noise covariance matrix or not. However, the knowledge of\ncorrelation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance\nimprovement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the\nnumber of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of\ncanceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of\nrelays.\n  For a dual-hop multiple access parallel network, we obtain closed form\nexpressions for the maximum sum-rate and the optimal relay strategy. The relay\noptimization for networks with three hops is also considered. For any relay\ngains for the first stage relays, this represents a parallel relay network with\ncorrelated noise.

    "summary": "In a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a MIMO system, the channel\nmatrix is of the form of a block matrix. We propose a method to calculate the\nlimit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the size of the\nblocks tends to infinity. We will also calculate the asymptotic eigenvalue\ndistribution of $HH^*$, where the entries of $H$ are jointly Gaussian, with a\ncorrelation of the form $E[h_{pj}\\bar h_{qk}]= \\sum_{s=1}^t\n\\Psi^{(s)}_{jk}\\hat\\Psi^{(s)}_{pq}$ (where $t$ is fixed and does not increase\nwith the size of the matrix). We will use an operator-valued free probability\napproach to achieve this goal. Using this method, we derive a system of\nequations, which can be solved numerically to compute the desired eigenvalue\ndistribution."

Fading is assumed to be the dominant factor affecting the\nstrength of the channels between transmitter and receiver terminals. It is\nassumed that each link can be active and transmit with a constant power P or\nremain silent. The objective is to maximize the throughput over the selection\nof active links. By deriving an upper bound and a lower bound, it is shown that\nin the case of Rayleigh fading (i) the maximum throughput scales like $\\log n$\n(ii) the maximum throughput is achievable in a distributed fashion.

A key finding of this work is that substantial improvements in\nreliability can be realized with a very short expected delay and a slightly\nlonger (but bounded) worst-case decoding delay guarantee in communication\nsystems where the transmitter has access to even one bit per coherence interval\nof causal CSI. While similar in spirit to the recent work on communication\nsystems based on automatic repeat requests (ARQ) where decoding failure is\nknown at the transmitter and leads to re-transmission, here transmit\nside-information is purely based on CSI. The findings reported here also lend\nfurther support to an emerging understanding that decoding delay (related to\nthroughput) and codeword blocklength (related to coding complexity and delays)\nare distinctly different design parameters which can be tuned to control\nreliability."

For single-user systems, transmit\ndiversity schemes suffer a loss in spectral efficiency if the receiver is\nequipped with more than one antenna, making them unsuitable for high rate\ntransmission. One such transmit diversity scheme is the cyclic delay diversity\ncode (CDD). The advantage of CDD over other diversity schemes such as\northogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) is that a code rate of one and delay\noptimality are achieved independent of the number of transmit antennas. In this\nwork we analyze the ergodic rate of a multi-user multiple access channel (MAC)\nwith each user applying such a cyclic delay diversity (CDD) code. We derive\nclosed form expressions for the ergodic sum-rate of multi-user CDD and compare\nit with the sum-capacity. We study the ergodic rate region and show that in\ncontrast to what is conventionally known regarding the single-user case,\ntransmit diversity schemes are viable candidates for high rate transmission in\nmulti-user systems. Finally, our theoretical findings are illustrated by\nnumerical simulation results."

    "summary": "In many channel measurement applications, one needs to estimate some\ncharacteristics of the channels based on a limited set of measurements. This is\nmainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this\ncontribution, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel\ncapacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied\nin various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics\nand mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for\ndescribing the asymptotic behaviour of many large-dimensional systems. In\nparticular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an\nasymptotically (w.r.t. the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator\nfor MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based\nestimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator,\nis also introduced by slightly modifying the free probability based estimator.\nThis estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the\nchannel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this\nproperty when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency\ndrift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is\nalso shown that both the free probability based and the Gaussian matrix mean\nbased estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number\nof transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and\nfrequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also\nexplained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for\na low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the\nasymptotic results."

In this work, we propose the n-times stacked Alamouti scheme\nfor n_T=2n transmit antennas and show that this scheme achieves the capacity in\nthe case of n_R=1 receive antenna. This result may regarded as an extension of\nthe Alamouti case. For the more general case of more than one receive antenna,\nwe show that if the number of transmit antennas is higher than the number of\nreceive antennas we achieve a high portion of the capacity with this scheme.\nFurther, we show that the MIMO capacity is at most twice the rate achieved with\nthe proposed scheme for all SNR. We derive lower and upper bounds for the rate\nachieved with this scheme and compare it with upper and lower bounds for the\ncapacity. In addition to the capacity analysis based on the assumption of a\ncoherent channel, we analyze the error rate performance of the stacked OSTBC\nwith the optimal ML detector and with the suboptimal lattice-reduction (LR)\naided zero-forcing detector.

Channel inversion and threshold\nscheduling may be viewed as simple ways to exploit channel state information\n(CSI) without requiring cooperation across transmitters. We use the\ntransmission capacity (TC) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatial\nintensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint on\nthe outage probability (OP). By assuming the nodes are located on the infinite\nplane according to a Poisson process, we are able to employ tools from\nstochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distribution\nof the signal-to-interference (SIR) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on the\nOP (relative to a given SIR threshold) and the TC. We demonstrate that in the\nabsence of CSI, fading can significantly reduce the TC and somewhat\nsurprisingly, channel inversion only makes matters worse. We develop a\nthreshold-based transmission rule where transmitters are active only if the\nchannel to their receiver is acceptably strong, obtain expressions for the\noptimal threshold, and show that this simple, fully distributed scheme can\nsignificantly reduce the effect of fading."

    "summary": "We consider the multiuser successive refinement (MSR) problem, where the\nusers are connected to a central server via links with different noiseless\ncapacities, and each user wishes to reconstruct in a successive-refinement\nfashion. An achievable region is given for the two-user two-layer case and it\nprovides the complete rate-distortion region for the Gaussian source under the\nMSE distortion measure. The key observation is that this problem includes the\nmultiple description (MD) problem (with two descriptions) as a subsystem, and\nthe techniques useful in the MD problem can be extended to this case. We show\nthat the coding scheme based on the universality of random binning is\nsub-optimal, because multiple Gaussian side informations only at the decoders\ndo incur performance loss, in contrast to the case of single side information\nat the decoder. We further show that unlike the single user case, when there\nare multiple users, the loss of performance by a multistage coding approach can\nbe unbounded for the Gaussian source. The result suggests that in such a\nsetting, the benefit of using successive refinement is not likely to justify\nthe accompanying performance loss. The MSR problem is also related to the\nsource coding problem where each decoder has its individual side information,\nwhile the encoder has the complete set of the side informations. The MSR\nproblem further includes several variations of the MD problem, for which the\nspecialization of the general result is investigated and the implication is\ndiscussed."

The receiver, by means of a sequential\ndecoder, must isolate the message without knowing when the codeword\ntransmission starts but being cognizant of the asynchronism level A. We are\ninterested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message,\nparticularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword\nlength N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'\n  This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor\nthat remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits\ninformation to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.\n  The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as\nN tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed\nthe `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form\nexpression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized\nchannel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable\nstrictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where\nthe rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time\ninformation starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.\n  As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a\nGaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR\nfor achieving reliable communication."

Local Kalman filters are implemented on the\n($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after\nspatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems\noverlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman\nfilters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized\nerror processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian\napproximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that\ndecreases as $L\\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower\nbound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for\nsub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local\nerror covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)\nalgorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)\ncentralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local\ncommunication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are\ncommon among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and\nconsensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full\ndistribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman\nfilter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized\nerror processes.

    "summary": "We consider slow fading relay channels with a single multi-antenna\nsource-destination terminal pair. The source signal arrives at the destination\nvia N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such\nchannels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the\nrelays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative\ndecode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set\nbound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive\namplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the\nchannel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To\nimprove the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the\nparallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source\nsignal go through K different \"AF paths\" in the multihop channel. This parallel\nAF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum\ndiversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not\nachieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward\n(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF\nscheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a\ndistributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT\npromised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are\nalso proposed."

In this paper, a MAC-PHY cross-layer scheme is\nproposed that enables collaborative beamforming at significantly reduced\ncollaboration overhead. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes\ntransmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous\ntransmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all\ntransmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting\nas a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one\nor more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received\nanalog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each\ncooperating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add\ncoherently at the destination node. Assuming that each node has access to\nlocation information, the proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in\ncertain cases exceeds one.

In this paper, two\nasynchronous cooperative diversity schemes are proposed, namely, distributed\ndelay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity\nschemes. In terms of the overall diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff function,\nwe show that the proposed independent coding based distributed delay diversity\nand asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes achieve the\nsame performance as the synchronous space-time coded approach which requires an\naccurate symbol-level timing synchronization to ensure signals arriving at the\ndestination from different relay nodes are perfectly synchronized. This\ndemonstrates diversity order is maintained even at the presence of asynchronism\nbetween relay node. Moreover, when all relay nodes succeed in decoding the\nsource information, the asynchronous space-time coded approach is capable of\nachieving better DM-tradeoff than synchronous schemes and performs equivalently\nto transmitting information through a parallel fading channel as far as the\nDM-tradeoff is concerned. Our results suggest the benefits of fully exploiting\nthe space-time degrees of freedom in multiple antenna systems by employing\nasynchronous space-time codes even in a frequency flat fading channel. In\naddition, it is shown asynchronous space-time coded systems are able to achieve\nhigher mutual information than synchronous space-time coded systems for any\nfinite signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) when properly selected baseband waveforms\nare employed."

    "summary": "We address the connection between the multiple-description (MD) problem and\nDelta-Sigma quantization. The inherent redundancy due to oversampling in\nDelta-Sigma quantization, and the simple linear-additive noise model resulting\nfrom dithered lattice quantization, allow us to construct a symmetric and\ntime-invariant MD coding scheme. We show that the use of a noise shaping filter\nmakes it possible to trade off central distortion for side distortion.\nAsymptotically as the dimension of the lattice vector quantizer and order of\nthe noise shaping filter approach infinity, the entropy rate of the dithered\nDelta-Sigma quantization scheme approaches the symmetric two-channel MD\nrate-distortion function for a memoryless Gaussian source and MSE fidelity\ncriterion, at any side-to-central distortion ratio and any resolution. In the\noptimal scheme, the infinite-order noise shaping filter must be minimum phase\nand have a piece-wise flat power spectrum with a single jump discontinuity. An\nimportant advantage of the proposed design is that it is symmetric in rate and\ndistortion by construction, so the coding rates of the descriptions are\nidentical and there is therefore no need for source splitting."

When the relay\nlistens, the channel operates in the broadcast mode. The channel switches to\nthe multiple access mode when the relay transmits. If the broadcast component\nchannel is physically degraded, the half-duplex relay channel will also be\nreferred to as physically degraded. The capacity of this degraded half-duplex\nrelay channel is examined. It is shown that the block Markov coding suggested\nin the seminal paper by Cover and El Gamal can be modified to achieve capacity\nfor the degraded half-duplex relay channel. In the code construction, the\nlisten-transmit schedule of the relay is made to depend on the message to be\nsent and hence the schedule carries information itself. If the schedule is\nrestricted to be deterministic, it is shown that the capacity can be achieved\nby a simple management of information flows across the broadcast and multiple\naccess component channels."

This\npaper discusses the implications of order irrelevance on source coding,\npresenting results in several major branches of source coding theory: lossless\ncoding, universal lossless coding, rate-distortion, high-rate quantization, and\nuniversal lossy coding. The main conclusions demonstrate that there is a\nsignificant rate savings when order is irrelevant. In particular, lossless\ncoding of n letters from a finite alphabet requires Theta(log n) bits and\nuniversal lossless coding requires n + o(n) bits for many countable alphabet\nsources. However, there are no universal schemes that can drive a strong\nredundancy measure to zero. Results for lossy coding include distribution-free\nexpressions for the rate savings from order irrelevance in various high-rate\nquantization schemes. Rate-distortion bounds are given, and it is shown that\nthe analogue of the Shannon lower bound is loose at all finite rates."

The\nalgorithm, which generalizes the recently introduced DUDE (Discrete Universal\nDEnoiser) of Weissman et al., aims to compete with a genie that has access, in\naddition to the noisy data, also to the underlying clean data, and can choose\nto switch, up to $m$ times, between sliding window denoisers in a way that\nminimizes the overall loss. When the underlying data form an individual\nsequence, we show that the S-DUDE performs essentially as well as this genie,\nprovided that $m$ is sub-linear in the size of the data. When the clean data is\nemitted by a piecewise stationary process, we show that the S-DUDE achieves the\noptimum distribution-dependent performance, provided that the same\nsub-linearity condition is imposed on the number of switches. To further\nsubstantiate the universal optimality of the S-DUDE, we show that when the\nnumber of switches is allowed to grow linearly with the size of the data,\n\\emph{any} (sequence of) scheme(s) fails to compete in the above senses. Using\ndynamic programming, we derive an efficient implementation of the S-DUDE, which\nhas complexity (time and memory) growing only linearly with the data size and\nthe number of switches $m$. Preliminary experimental results are presented,\nsuggesting that S-DUDE has the capacity to significantly improve on the\nperformance attained by the original DUDE in applications where the nature of\nthe data abruptly changes in time (or space), as is often the case in practice."

Then,\nthis is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\ndistributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional\nconditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the\nknown classes of STBCs. It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located\nMIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD\nfor a PCRC, single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and\nonly coding gain is lost. It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC, then\narbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase\ncomponents of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC.\nFinally, it is shown that the possibility of {\\em channel phase compensation}\noperation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the\npossible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $\\frac{2}{N}$ when the relays do not have CSI\nto 1/2, which is independent of N."

In this case,\nwe derive an upper bound of the data-rate of the DOSTBC and it is larger than\nthat of the row-monomial DOSTBCs in [1]. Secondly, we abandon the CSI\nlimitation; but keep the row-monomial limitation. Specifically, we propose the\nrow-monomial DOSTBCs with channel phase information (DOSTBCs-CPI) and derive an\nupper bound of the data-rate of those codes. The rowmonomial DOSTBCs-CPI have\nhigher data-rate than the DOSTBCs and the row-monomial DOSTBCs. Furthermore, we\nfind the actual row-monomial DOSTBCs-CPI which achieve the upper bound of the\ndata-rate."

    "summary": "We present a joint source-channel multiple description (JSC-MD) framework for\nresource-constrained network communications (e.g., sensor networks), in which\none or many deprived encoders communicate a Markov source against bit errors\nand erasure errors to many heterogeneous decoders, some powerful and some\ndeprived. To keep the encoder complexity at minimum, the source is coded into K\ndescriptions by a simple multiple description quantizer (MDQ) with neither\nentropy nor channel coding. The code diversity of MDQ and the path diversity of\nthe network are exploited by decoders to correct transmission errors and\nimprove coding efficiency. A key design objective is resource scalability:\npowerful nodes in the network can perform JSC-MD distributed\nestimation/decoding under the criteria of maximum a posteriori probability\n(MAP) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), while primitive nodes resort to\nsimpler MD decoding, all working with the same MDQ code. The application of\nJSC-MD to distributed estimation of hidden Markov models in a sensor network is\ndemonstrated. The proposed JSC-MD MAP estimator is an algorithm of the longest\npath in a weighted directed acyclic graph, while the JSC-MD MMSE decoder is an\nextension of the well-known forward-backward algorithm to multiple\ndescriptions. Both algorithms simultaneously exploit the source memory, the\nredundancy of the fixed-rate MDQ, and the inter-description correlations. They\noutperform the existing hard-decision MDQ decoders by large margins (up to\n8dB). For Gaussian Markov sources, the complexity of JSC-MD distributed MAP\nsequence estimation can be made as low as that of typical single description\nViterbi-type algorithms."

    "summary": "Consider a wireless MIMO multi-hop channel with n_s non-cooperating source\nantennas and n_d fully cooperating destination antennas, as well as L clusters\ncontaining k non-cooperating relay antennas each. The source signal traverses\nall L clusters of relay antennas, before it reaches the destination. When relay\nantennas within the same cluster scale their received signals by the same\nconstant before the retransmission, the equivalent channel matrix H relating\nthe input signals at the source antennas to the output signals at the\ndestination antennas is proportional to the product of channel matrices H_l,\nl=1,...,L+1, corresponding to the individual hops. We perform an asymptotic\ncapacity analysis for this channel as follows: In a first instance we take the\nlimits n_s->infty, n_d->infty and k->infty, but keep both n_s/n_d and k/n_d\nfixed. Then, we take the limits L->infty and k/n_d->infty. Requiring that the\nH_l's satisfy the conditions needed for the Marcenko-Pastur law, we prove that\nthe capacity scales linearly in min{n_s,n_d}, as long as the ratio k/n_d scales\nat least linearly in L. Moreover, we show that up to a noise penalty and a\npre-log factor the capacity of a point-to-point MIMO channel is approached,\nwhen this scaling is slightly faster than linear. Conversely, almost all\nspatial degrees of freedom vanish for less than linear scaling."

    "summary": "The optimal decoder achieving the outage capacity under imperfect channel\nestimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest\nneighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded\nmodulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of\nthe transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. Next, we\nspecialize our general expression to obtain the corresponding decoding metric\nfor fading MIMO channels. According to the notion of estimation-induced outage\n(EIO) capacity introduced in our previous work and assuming no channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the transmitter, we characterize maximal achievable\ninformation rates, using Gaussian codebooks, associated to the proposed\ndecoder. In the case of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, these achievable rates\nare compared to the rates achieved by the classical mismatched\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) decoder and the ultimate limits given by the EIO\ncapacity. Numerical results show that the derived metric provides significant\ngains for the considered scenario, in terms of achievable information rates and\nbit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) framework,\nwithout introducing any additional decoding complexity."

In addition, we show that in the high\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime the penalty for not knowing eavesdropper's\nchannel is small--a simple ``secure space-time code'' that can be thought of as\nmasked beamforming and radiates power isotropically attains near-optimal\nperformance. In the limit of large number of antennas, we obtain a\nrealization-independent characterization of the secrecy capacity as a function\nof the number $\\beta$: the number of eavesdropper antennas per sender antenna.\nWe show that the eavesdropper is comparatively ineffective when $\\beta<1$, but\nthat for $\\beta\\ge2$ the eavesdropper can drive the secrecy capacity to zero,\nthereby blocking secure communication to the intended receiver.

These achievable\nregions are derived for the general discrete memoryless case first and then\nextended to the case when the channel is degraded Gaussian and the SI is\nadditive i.i.d. Gaussian. In this case, the source uses generalized dirty paper\ncoding (GDPC), i.e., DPC combined with partial state cancellation, when only\nthe source is informed, and DPC alone when both the source and the relay are\ninformed.

A proper modification of these bounds makes\nthem universal for the set of all MBIOS channels which exhibit a given\ncapacity. Bounds on the degree distributions and graphical complexity apply to\nfinite-length LDPC codes and to the asymptotic case of an infinite block\nlength.

    "summary": "Recently Li and Xia have proposed a transmission scheme for wireless relay\nnetworks based on the Alamouti space time code and orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing to combat the effect of timing errors at the relay nodes.\nThis transmission scheme is amazingly simple and achieves a diversity order of\ntwo for any number of relays. Motivated by its simplicity, this scheme is\nextended to a more general transmission scheme that can achieve full\ncooperative diversity for any number of relays. The conditions on the\ndistributed space time code (DSTC) structure that admit its application in the\nproposed transmission scheme are identified and it is pointed out that the\nrecently proposed full diversity four group decodable DSTCs from precoded\nco-ordinate interleaved orthogonal designs and extended Clifford algebras\nsatisfy these conditions. It is then shown how differential encoding at the\nsource can be combined with the proposed transmission scheme to arrive at a new\ntransmission scheme that can achieve full cooperative diversity in asynchronous\nwireless relay networks with no channel information and also no timing error\nknowledge at the destination node. Finally, four group decodable distributed\ndifferential space time codes applicable in this new transmission scheme for\npower of two number of relays are also provided."

    "summary": "We address the optimization of the sum rate performance in multicell\ninterference-limited singlehop networks where access points are allowed to\ncooperate in terms of joint resource allocation. The resource allocation\npolicies considered here combine power control and user scheduling. Although\nvery promising from a conceptual point of view, the optimization of the sum of\nper-link rates hinges, in principle, on tough issues such as computational\ncomplexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter channel\ninformation feedback across all network cells. In this paper, we show that, in\nfact, distributed algorithms are actually obtainable in the asymptotic regime\nwhere the numbers of users per cell is allowed to grow large. Additionally,\nusing extreme value theory, we provide scaling laws for upper and lower bounds\nfor the network capacity (sum of single user rates over all cells),\ncorresponding to zero-interference and worst-case interference scenarios. We\nshow that the scaling is either dominated by path loss statistics or by\nsmall-scale fading, depending on the regime and user location scenario. We show\nthat upper and lower rate bounds behave in fact identically, asymptotically.\nThis remarkable result suggests not only that distributed resource allocation\nis practically possible but also that the impact of multicell interference on\nthe capacity (in terms of scaling) actually vanishes asymptotically."

    "summary": "Previous work on relay networks has concentrated primarily on the diversity\nbenefits of such techniques. This paper explores the possibility of also\nobtaining multiplexing gain in a relay network, while retaining diversity gain.\nSpecifically, consider a network in which a single source node is equipped with\none antenna and a destination is equipped with two antennas. It is shown that,\nin certain scenarios, by adding a relay with two antennas and using a\nsuccessive relaying protocol, the diversity multiplexing tradeoff performance\nof the network can be lower bounded by that of a 2 by 2 MIMO channel, when the\ndecode-and-forward protocol is applied at the relay. A distributed D-BLAST\narchitecture is developed, in which parallel channel coding is applied to\nachieve this tradeoff. A space-time coding strategy, which can bring a maximal\nmultiplexing gain of more than one, is also derived for this scenario. As will\nbe shown, while this space-time coding strategy exploits maximal diversity for\na small multiplexing gain, the proposed successive relaying scheme offers a\nsignificant performance advantage for higher data rate transmission. In\naddition to the specific results shown here, these ideas open a new direction\nfor exploiting the benefits of wireless relay networks."

    "summary": "Rate and diversity impose a fundamental tradeoff in communications. This\ntradeoff was investigated for Intersymbol Interference (ISI) channels in [4]. A\ndifferent point of view was explored in [1] where high-rate codes were designed\nso that they have a high-diversity code embedded within them. Such diversity\nembedded codes were investigated for flat fading channels and in this paper we\nexplore its application to ISI channels. In particular, we investigate the rate\ntuples achievable for diversity embedded codes for scalar ISI channels through\nparticular coding strategies. The main result of this paper is that the\ndiversity multiplexing tradeoff for fading ISI channels is indeed successively\nrefinable. This implies that for fading single input single output (SISO) ISI\nchannels one can embed a high diversity code within a high rate code without\nany performance loss (asymptotically). This is related to a deterministic\nstructural observation about the asymptotic behavior of frequency response of\nchannel with respect to fading strength of time domain taps."

We\nthen prove that for expander codes, the active set of any fractional\npseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set of any\ncodeword. We further exploit these geometrical properties to devise an improved\ndecoding algorithm with the same complexity order as LP decoding that provably\nperforms better, for any blocklength. It proceeds by guessing facets of the\npolytope, and then resolving the linear program on these facets. While the LP\ndecoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest likelihood over all\npseudocodewords, we prove that the proposed algorithm, when applied to suitable\nexpander codes, succeeds unless there exist a certain number of\npseudocodewords, all adjacent to the ML codeword on the LP decoding polytope,\nand with higher likelihood than the ML codeword. We then describe an extended\nalgorithm, still with polynomial complexity, that succeeds as long as there are\nat most polynomially many pseudocodewords above the ML codeword."

It remains, however, unclear whether it still\nholds for any arbitrary networks and/or with high channel signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and high signal-to-measurement-noise ratio (SMNR). In this paper, we\nfirst provide a joint source and channel coding approach in estimating Gaussian\nsources over Gaussian MAC channels, as well as its sufficient and necessary\ncondition in restoring Gaussian sources with a prescribed distortion value. An\ninteresting relationship between our proposed joint approach with a more\nstraightforward separate source and channel coding scheme is then established.\nWe then formulate constrained power minimization problems and transform them to\nrelaxed convex geometric programming problems, whose numerical results exhibit\nthat either separate or uncoded scheme becomes dominant over a linear topology\nnetwork. In addition, we prove that the optimal decoding order to minimize the\ntotal transmission powers for both source and channel coding parts is solely\nsubject to the ranking of MAC channel qualities, and has nothing to do with the\nranking of measurement qualities. Finally, asymptotic results for homogeneous\nnetworks are obtained which not only confirm the existing optimality of the\nuncoded approach, but also show that the asymptotic SNR exponents of these\nthree approaches are all the same. Moreover, the proposed joint approach share\nthe same asymptotic ratio with respect to high SNR and high SMNR as the uncoded\nscheme."

    "summary": "In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to\neavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have\nbecome critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper\nconsiders the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast\nchannel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential\nmessages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user\nwould like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe\nmanner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian\nbroadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this\ncommunication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the\ncorresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on\nGaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy\ncapacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer\nbound prove to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding\nachievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM\nis established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can\nachieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy\nrequirement."

    "summary": "In this paper we investigate the achievable rate of a system that includes a\nnomadic transmitter with several antennas, which is received by multiple\nagents, exhibiting independent channel gains and additive circular-symmetric\ncomplex Gaussian noise. In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not\nhave any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and\nforward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed\ncapacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and\nalso on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block\nfading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two\nagents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.\nLimiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian\nsignalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based\non the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then\ncompared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic\nsetting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is\nanalyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in\nseveral examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a\nfinite $2\\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over\nelementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We also consider the non-nomadic setting, with\nagents that can decode. Here we give an achievable rate, over fast fading\nchannel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralized\nreception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting."

The original\nversion, based on Goppa codes, is able to guarantee a high level of security,\nand is faster than competing solutions, like RSA. Despite this, it has been\nrarely considered in practical applications, due to two major drawbacks: i)\nlarge size of the public key and ii) low transmission rate. Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes are state-of-art forward error correcting codes that\npermit to approach the Shannon limit while ensuring limited complexity.\nQuasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are a particular class of LDPC codes, able to join\nlow complexity encoding of QC codes with high-performing and low-complexity\ndecoding of LDPC codes. In a previous work it has been proposed to adopt a\nparticular family of QC-LDPC codes in the McEliece cryptosystem to reduce the\nkey size and increase the transmission rate. Recently, however, new attacks\nhave been found that are able to exploit a flaw in the transformation from the\nprivate key to the public one. Such attacks can be effectively countered by\nchanging the form of some constituent matrices, without altering the system\nparameters. This work gives an overview of the QC-LDPC codes-based McEliece\ncryptosystem and its cryptanalysis. Two recent versions are considered, and\ntheir ability to counter all the currently known attacks is discussed. A third\nversion able to reach a higher security level is also proposed. Finally, it is\nshown that the new QC-LDPC codes-based cryptosystem scales favorably with the\nkey length."

We examine two scenarios: when\nthe transmitter has no channel state information and adopts uniform transmit\npower allocation among parallel channels; and when the transmitter is endowed\nwith an one-bit channel state feedback for each parallel channel and\naccordingly allocates its transmit power.

    "summary": "This paper introduces a new counting code. Its design was motivated by\ndistributed video coding where, for decoding, error correction methods are\napplied to improve predictions. Those error corrections sometimes fail which\nresults in decoded values worse than the initial prediction. Our code exploits\nthe fact that bit errors are relatively unlikely events: more than a few bit\nerrors in a decoded pixel value are rare. With a carefully designed counting\ncode combined with a prediction those bit errors can be corrected and sometimes\nthe original pixel value recovered. The error correction improves\nsignificantly. Our new code not only maximizes the Hamming distance between\nadjacent (or \"near 1\") codewords but also between nearby (for example \"near 2\")\ncodewords. This is why our code is significantly different from the well-known\nmaximal counting sequences which have maximal average Hamming distance.\nFortunately, the new counting code can be derived from Gray Codes for every\ncode word length (i.e. bit depth)."

It has been recently derived by Dror Weitz and used to\nconstruct the first fully polynomial approximation scheme for counting\nindependent sets up to the `tree uniqueness threshold.' It can be regarded as a\nclever method for pruning the belief propagation computation tree, in such a\nway to exactly account for the effect of loops.\n  In this paper we generalize the original algorithm to make it suitable for\ndecoding linear codes, and discuss various schemes for pruning the computation\ntree.

Finally, we\ndiscuss theoretical implications of the new method."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for the general relay channel.\nThis coding scheme is in the form of a block Markov code. The transmitter uses\na superposition Markov code. The relay compresses the received signal and maps\nthe compressed version of the received signal into a codeword conditioned on\nthe codeword of the previous block. The receiver performs joint decoding after\nit has received all of the B blocks. We show that this coding scheme can be\nviewed as a generalization of the well-known Compress-And-Forward (CAF) scheme\nproposed by Cover and El Gamal. Our coding scheme provides options for\npreserving the correlation between the channel inputs of the transmitter and\nthe relay, which is not possible in the CAF scheme. Thus, our proposed scheme\nmay potentially yield a larger achievable rate than the CAF scheme."

    "summary": "In this paper we formalize the notions of information elements and\ninformation lattices, first proposed by Shannon. Exploiting this formalization,\nwe identify a comprehensive parallelism between information lattices and\nsubgroup lattices. Qualitatively, we demonstrate isomorphisms between\ninformation lattices and subgroup lattices. Quantitatively, we establish a\ndecisive approximation relation between the entropy structures of information\nlattices and the log-index structures of the corresponding subgroup lattices.\nThis approximation extends the approximation for joint entropies carried out\npreviously by Chan and Yeung. As a consequence of our approximation result, we\nshow that any continuous law holds in general for the entropies of information\nelements if and only if the same law holds in general for the log-indices of\nsubgroups. As an application, by constructing subgroup counterexamples we find\nsurprisingly that common information, unlike joint information, obeys neither\nthe submodularity nor the supermodularity law. We emphasize that the notion of\ninformation elements is conceptually significant--formalizing it helps to\nreveal the deep connection between information theory and group theory. The\nparallelism established in this paper admits an appealing group-action\nexplanation and provides useful insights into the intrinsic structure among\ninformation elements from a group-theoretic perspective."

Three\ndifferent systems are explored: antenna diversity systems, time/frequency\ndiversity systems, and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In order to\naccurately study performance in the fixed outage setting, it is necesary to go\nbeyond the coarse, asymptotic multiplexing gain metric. In the case of antenna\ndiversity and time/frequency diversity, an affine approximation to high SNR\noutage capacity (i.e., multiplexing gain plus a power/rate offset) accurately\ndescribes performance and shows the very significant benefits of diversity. ARQ\nis also seen to provide a significant performance advantage, but even an affine\napproximation to outage capacity is unable to capture this advantage and outage\ncapacity must be directly studied in the non-asymptotic regime."

    "summary": "Franceschetti et al. have recently shown that per-node throughput in an\nextended, ad hoc wireless network with $\\Theta(n)$ randomly distributed nodes\nand multihop routing can be increased from the $\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n} \\log\nn})$ scaling demonstrated in the seminal paper of Gupta and Kumar to $\\Omega({1\n\\over \\sqrt{n}})$. The goal of the present paper is to understand the\ndependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it\nintroduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link\ntransmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise\nratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a\nsystem of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by\npercolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved\nthroughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which\nenables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established\nby showing that throughput $\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a\nsystem that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to\nestablish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\\Theta(\\log n)$ routes\nwithin a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination. As a\nresult, highways are not essential. In addition, it is shown that throughput\n$\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained with the original threshold\ntransmission bit-rate model, provided that node transmission powers are\npermitted to grow with $n$. Thus, the benefit of the capacity bit-rate model is\nsimply to permit the power to remain bounded, even as the network expands."

The\ninner bound is based on strategies that generalize prior work, and include\nrate-splitting, Gel'fand-Pinsker coding and cooperative transmission. A general\nouter bound is based on the Nair-El Gamal outer bound for broadcast channels. A\nsimpler bound is presented for the case in which one of the decoders can decode\nboth messages.

    "summary": "The problem of channel shortening equalization for optimal detection in ISI\nchannels is considered. The problem is to choose a linear equalizer and a\npartial response target filter such that the combination produces the best\ndetection performance. Instead of using the traditional approach of MMSE\nequalization, we directly seek all equalizer and target pairs that yield\noptimal detection performance in terms of the sequence or symbol error rate.\nThis leads to a new notion of a posteriori equivalence between the equalized\nand target channels with a simple characterization in terms of their underlying\nprobability distributions. Using this characterization we show the surprising\nexistence an infinite family of equalizer and target pairs for which any\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) based detector designed for the target channel is\nsimultaneously MAP optimal for the equalized channel. For channels whose input\nsymbols have equal energy, such as q-PSK, the MMSE equalizer designed with a\nmonic target constraint yields a solution belonging to this optimal family of\ndesigns. Although, these designs produce IIR target filters, the ideas are\nextended to design good FIR targets. For an arbitrary choice of target and\nequalizer, we derive an expression for the probability of sequence detection\nerror. This expression is used to design optimal FIR targets and IIR equalizers\nand to quantify the FIR approximation penalty."

The goal is to quantify\nthe total data rate required for the reconstruction of the field with a given\nmean square distortion. We consider a class of two-stage mechanisms which a)\nsend information to allow the reconstruction of the sensor's samples within\nsufficient accuracy, and then b) use these reconstructions to estimate the\nentire field. To implement the first stage, the heavy correlation between the\nsensor samples suggests the use of distributed coding schemes to reduce the\ntotal rate. We demonstrate the existence of a distributed block coding scheme\nthat achieves, for a given fidelity criterion for the reconstruction of the\nfield, a total information rate that is bounded by a constant, independent of\nthe number $N$ of sensors. The constant in general depends on the\nautocorrelation function of the field and the desired distortion criterion for\nthe sensor samples. We then describe a scheme which can be implemented using\nonly scalar quantizers at the sensors, without any use of distributed source\ncoding, and which also achieves a total information rate that is a constant,\nindependent of the number of sensors. While this scheme operates at a rate that\nis greater than the rate achievable through distributed coding and entails\ngreater delay in reconstruction, its simplicity makes it attractive for\nimplementation in sensor networks."

    "summary": "The distributed source coding problem is considered when the sensors, or\nencoders, are under Byzantine attack; that is, an unknown group of sensors have\nbeen reprogrammed by a malicious intruder to undermine the reconstruction at\nthe fusion center. Three different forms of the problem are considered. The\nfirst is a variable-rate setup, in which the decoder adaptively chooses the\nrates at which the sensors transmit. An explicit characterization of the\nvariable-rate achievable sum rates is given for any number of sensors and any\ngroups of traitors. The converse is proved constructively by letting the\ntraitors simulate a fake distribution and report the generated values as the\ntrue ones. This fake distribution is chosen so that the decoder cannot\ndetermine which sensors are traitors while maximizing the required rate to\ndecode every value. Achievability is proved using a scheme in which the decoder\nreceives small packets of information from a sensor until its message can be\ndecoded, before moving on to the next sensor. The sensors use randomization to\nchoose from a set of coding functions, which makes it probabilistically\nimpossible for the traitors to cause the decoder to make an error. Two forms of\nthe fixed-rate problem are considered, one with deterministic coding and one\nwith randomized coding. The achievable rate regions are given for both these\nproblems, and it is shown that lower rates can be achieved with randomized\ncoding."

It is assumed that each link can be active and transmit\nwith a constant power $P$ or remain silent. The objective is to maximize the\nnumber of active links such that each active link can transmit with a constant\nrate $\\lambda$. An upper bound is derived that shows the number of active links\nscales at most like $\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\log n$. To obtain a lower bound, a\ndecentralized link activation strategy is described and analyzed. It is shown\nthat for small values of $\\lambda$, the number of supported links by this\nstrategy meets the upper bound; however, as $\\lambda$ grows, this number\nbecomes far below the upper bound. To shrink the gap between the upper bound\nand the achievability result, a modified link activation strategy is proposed\nand analyzed based on some results from random graph theory. It is shown that\nthis modified strategy performs very close to the optimum. Specifically, this\nstrategy is \\emph{asymptotically almost surely} optimum when $\\lambda$\napproaches $\\infty$ or 0.

The analysis is accomplished in two steps.\nIn the first step, the direct link between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver\n(Rx) is ignored and we show that the transmitter and the relay should map their\nsignals to the strongest right singular vectors of the Tx-relay and relay-Rx\nchannels. Based on the distributions of these vectors for independent\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh channels, the Grassmannian codebooks\nare used for quantizing and sending back the channel information to the\ntransmitter and the relay. The simulation results show that even a few number\nof bits can considerably increase the link reliability in terms of bit error\nrate. For the second step, the direct link is considered in the problem model\nand we derive the optimization problem that identifies the optimal Tx\nbeamforming vector. For the i.i.d Rayleigh channels, we show that the solution\nto this problem is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere and we justify the\nappropriateness of the Grassmannian codebook (for determining the optimal\nbeamforming vector), both analytically and by simulation. Finally, a modified\nquantizing scheme is presented which introduces a negligible degradation in the\nsystem performance but significantly reduces the required number of feedback\nbits."

    "summary": "We describe and present a new construction method for codes using encodings\nfrom group rings. They consist primarily of two types: zero-divisor and\nunit-derived codes. Previous codes from group rings focused on ideals; for\nexample cyclic codes are ideals in the group ring over a cyclic group. The\nfresh focus is on the encodings themselves, which only under very limited\nconditions result in ideals. We use the result that a group ring is isomorphic\nto a certain well-defined ring of matrices, and thus every group ring element\nhas an associated matrix. This allows matrix algebra to be used as needed in\nthe study and production of codes, enabling the creation of standard generator\nand check matrices. Group rings are a fruitful source of units and\nzero-divisors from which new codes result. Many code properties, such as being\nLDPC or self-dual, may be expressed as properties within the group ring thus\nenabling the construction of codes with these properties. The methods are\ngeneral enabling the construction of codes with many types of group rings.\nThere is no restriction on the ring and thus codes over the integers, over\nmatrix rings or even over group rings themselves are possible and fruitful."

    "summary": "This paper addresses the following question, which is of interest in the\ndesign of a multiuser decentralized network. Given a total system bandwidth of\nW Hz and a fixed data rate constraint of R bps for each transmission, how many\nfrequency slots N of size W/N should the band be partitioned into in order to\nmaximize the number of simultaneous links in the network? Dividing the\navailable spectrum results in two competing effects. On the positive side, a\nlarger N allows for more parallel, noninterfering communications to take place\nin the same area. On the negative side, a larger N increases the SINR\nrequirement for each link because the same information rate must be achieved\nover less bandwidth. Exploring this tradeoff and determining the optimum value\nof N in terms of the system parameters is the focus of the paper. Using\nstochastic geometry, the optimal SINR threshold - which directly corresponds to\nthe optimal spectral efficiency - is derived for both the low SNR\n(power-limited) and high SNR (interference-limited) regimes. This leads to the\noptimum choice of the number of frequency bands N in terms of the path loss\nexponent, power and noise spectral density, desired rate, and total bandwidth."

Conventional codebook\ndesigns use Grassmannian packing, equiangular frames, vector quantization, or\nFourier based constructions. While the capacity and error rate performance of\nconventional codebook constructions have been extensively investigated,\nconstructing these codebooks is notoriously difficult relying on techniques\nsuch as nonlinear search or iterative algorithms. Further, the resulting\ncodebooks may not have a systematic structure to facilitate storage of the\ncodebook and low search complexity. In this paper, we propose a new systematic\ncodebook design based on Kerdock codes and mutually unbiased bases. The\nproposed Kerdock codebook consists of multiple mutually unbiased unitary bases\nmatrices with quaternary entries and the identity matrix. We propose to derive\nthe beamforming and precoding codebooks from this base codebook, eliminating\nthe requirement to store multiple codebooks. The propose structure requires\nlittle memory to store and, as we show, the quaternary structure facilitates\ncodeword search. We derive the chordal distance for two antenna and four\nantenna codebooks, showing that the proposed codebooks compare favorably with\nprior designs.

A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes\nis investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed\nfrom rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover,\nit is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be\nreformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where\npartial information about the error is available. This partial information may\nbe in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value)\nand deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking\nerasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the\nerror correction capability of a code: if $\\mu$ erasures and $\\delta$\ndeviations occur, then errors of rank $t$ can always be corrected provided that\n$2t \\leq d - 1 + \\mu + \\delta$, where $d$ is the minimum rank distance of the\ncode. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes,\nan efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures\nand deviations. In a network coding application where $n$ packets of length $M$\nover $F_q$ are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given\nby $O(dM)$ operations in an extension field $F_{q^n}$."

The transmission of the code ensembles\nis assumed to take place over a binary erasure channel, and the bounds refer to\nthe asymptotic case where we let the block length tend to infinity. The\nsimplicity of the bounds derived in this paper stems from the fact that they\nare easily evaluated and are expressed in terms of some basic parameters of the\nensemble which include the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, the target bit\nerasure probability and the gap between the channel capacity and the design\nrate of the ensemble. This paper demonstrates that the number of iterations\nwhich is required for successful message-passing decoding scales at least like\nthe inverse of the gap (in rate) to capacity, provided that the fraction of\ndegree-2 variable nodes of these turbo-like ensembles does not vanish (hence,\nthe number of iterations becomes unbounded as the gap to capacity vanishes)."

Since the channel is not\nergodic, Shannon's source-channel separation theorem becomes obsolete and the\noptimal performance requires a joint source -channel approach. Our goal is to\nminimize the expected end-to-end distortion, particularly in the high SNR\nregime. The figure of merit is the distortion exponent, defined as the\nexponential decay rate of the expected distortion with increasing SNR. We\nprovide an upper bound and lower bounds for the distortion exponent with\nrespect to the bandwidth ratio among the channel and source bandwidths. For the\nlower bounds, we analyze three different strategies based on layered source\ncoding concatenated with progressive, superposition or hybrid digital/analog\ntransmission. In each case, by adjusting the system parameters we optimize the\ndistortion exponent as a function of the bandwidth ratio. We prove that the\ndistortion exponent upper bound can be achieved when the channel has only one\ndegree of freedom, that is L=1, and $\\min\\{M_t,M_r\\}=1$. When we have more\ndegrees of freedom, our achievable distortion exponents meet the upper bound\nfor only certain ranges of the bandwidth ratio.

A tree decomposition can be\nextended to a tree realization, i.e., a cycle-free realization of the code on\nthe underlying tree, by specifying a state space at each edge of the tree, and\na local constraint code at each vertex of the tree. The constraint complexity\nof a tree realization is the maximum dimension of any of its local constraint\ncodes. A measure of the complexity of maximum-likelihood decoding for a code is\nits treewidth, which is the least constraint complexity of any of its tree\nrealizations.\n  It is known that among all tree realizations of a code that extends a given\ntree decomposition, there exists a unique minimal realization that minimizes\nthe state space dimension at each vertex of the underlying tree. In this paper,\nwe give two new constructions of these minimal realizations. As a by-product of\nthe first construction, a generalization of the state-merging procedure for\ntrellis realizations, we obtain the fact that the minimal tree realization also\nminimizes the local constraint code dimension at each vertex of the underlying\ntree. The second construction relies on certain code decomposition techniques\nthat we develop. We further observe that the treewidth of a code is related to\na measure of graph complexity, also called treewidth. We exploit this\nconnection to resolve a conjecture of Forney's regarding the gap between the\nminimum trellis constraint complexity and the treewidth of a code.

The second scheme is called statistical superposition coding\n(S-SC), in which each receiver adaptively performs successive decoding with the\nprocess statistically governed by the realized fading.

    "summary": "A pattern of a sequence is a sequence of integer indices with each index\ndescribing the order of first occurrence of the respective symbol in the\noriginal sequence. In a recent paper, tight general bounds on the block entropy\nof patterns of sequences generated by independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) sources were derived. In this paper, precise approximations are\nprovided for the pattern block entropies for patterns of sequences generated by\ni.i.d. uniform and monotonic distributions, including distributions over the\nintegers, and the geometric distribution. Numerical bounds on the pattern block\nentropies of these distributions are provided even for very short blocks. Tight\nbounds are obtained even for distributions that have infinite i.i.d. entropy\nrates. The approximations are obtained using general bounds and their\nderivation techniques. Conditional index entropy is also studied for\ndistributions over smaller alphabets."

    "summary": "The analysis of random coding error exponents pertaining to erasure/list\ndecoding, due to Forney, is revisited. Instead of using Jensen's inequality as\nwell as some other inequalities in the derivation, we demonstrate that an\nexponentially tight analysis can be carried out by assessing the relevant\nmoments of a certain distance enumerator. The resulting bound has the following\nadvantages: (i) it is at least as tight as Forney's bound, (ii) under certain\nsymmetry conditions associated with the channel and the random coding\ndistribution, it is simpler than Forney's bound in the sense that it involves\nan optimization over one parameter only (rather than two), and (iii) in certain\nspecial cases, like the binary symmetric channel (BSC), the optimum value of\nthis parameter can be found in closed form, and so, there is no need to conduct\na numerical search. We have not found yet, however, a numerical example where\nthis new bound is strictly better than Forney's bound. This may provide an\nadditional evidence to support Forney's conjecture that his bound is tight for\nthe average code. We believe that the technique we suggest in this paper can be\nuseful in simplifying, and hopefully also improving, exponential error bounds\nin other problem settings as well."

    "summary": "An interference alignment example is constructed for the deterministic\nchannel model of the $K$ user interference channel. The deterministic channel\nexample is then translated into the Gaussian setting, creating the first known\nexample of a fully connected Gaussian $K$ user interference network with single\nantenna nodes, real, non-zero and contant channel coefficients, and no\npropagation delays where the degrees of freedom outerbound is achieved. An\nanalogy is drawn between the propagation delay based interference alignment\nexamples and the deterministic channel model which also allows similar\nconstructions for the 2 user $X$ channel as well."
