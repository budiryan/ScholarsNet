    "summary": "The assumption of real-number arithmetic, which is at the basis of\nconventional geometric algorithms, has been seriously challenged in recent\nyears, since digital computers do not exhibit such capability.\n  A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some\nalgebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable\nresult, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate\nthe algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if\nthe exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some\n(small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the\nevaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure\nof the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the\ninput operands are error-free.\n  A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an \"arithmetic filter\". In this paper\nwe develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic\nfilter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the\nprobability of failure of the filter.\n  To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be\nchosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze\nthe two important predicates \"which-side\" and \"insphere\". We show that the\nprobability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no\nlarger than some positive value V, with emphasis on small V, is Theta(V) for\nthe which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Theta(V^(2/3))\nin dimension 1, O(sqrt(V)) in dimension 2, and O(sqrt(V) ln(1/V)) in higher\ndimensions. Constants are small, and are given in the paper."

Our work consists of two main parts. In the first, we address problems\nand measures that relate to collections of orthogonal line segments in the\nplane. Such collections arise naturally from problems in mapping buildings and\nrobot exploration.\n  We propose a new measure of segment similarity called a \\emph{coverage\nmeasure}, and present efficient algorithms for maximising this measure between\nsets of axis-parallel segments under translations. Our algorithms run in time\n$O(n^3\\polylog n)$ in the general case, and run in time $O(n^2\\polylog n)$ for\nthe case when all segments are horizontal. In addition, we show that when\nrestricted to translations that are only vertical, the Hausdorff distance\nbetween two sets of horizontal segments can be computed in time roughly\n$O(n^{3/2}{\\sl polylog}n)$. These algorithms form significant improvements over\nthe general algorithm of Chew et al. that takes time $O(n^4 \\log^2 n)$. In the\nsecond part of this paper we address the problem of matching polygonal chains.\nWe study the well known \\Frd, and present the first algorithm for computing the\n\\Frd under general translations.

An Omega(n log n) lower bound on\nthe time complexity of this problem is known.\n  We prove that preprocessing a chain of n edges and answering n dihedral\nrotation queries is 3SUM-hard, giving strong evidence that solving n queries\nrequires Omega(n^2) time in the worst case.

The parallelizations employ a\nsimple strategy: at each iteration, they choose a set of ``independent'' points\nto insert into the domain, and then update the Delaunay triangulation. We show\nthat such a set of independent points can be constructed efficiently in\nparallel and that the number of iterations needed is $O(\\log^2(L/s))$, where\n$L$ is the diameter of the domain, and $s$ is the smallest edge in the output\nmesh. In addition, we show that the insertion of each independent set of points\ncan be realized sequentially by Ruppert's method in two dimensions and\nShewchuk's in three dimensions. Therefore, our parallel Delaunay refinement\nmethods provide the same element quality and mesh size guarantees as the\nsequential algorithms in both two and three dimensions. For quasi-uniform\nmeshes, such as those produced by Chew's method, we show that the number of\niterations can be reduced to $O(\\log(L/s))$.

In particular, we study the variant\nof the carpenter's ruler problem in which there is a restriction that only one\njoint can be modified at a time. For a linkage that does not self-intersect or\nself-touch, the recent results of Connelly et al. and Streinu imply that it can\nalways be straightened, modifying one joint at a time. However, we show that\nfor a linkage with even a single vertex degeneracy, it becomes NP-hard to\ndecide if it can be straightened while altering only one joint at a time. If we\nadd the restriction that each joint can be altered at most once, we show that\nthe problem is NP-complete even without vertex degeneracies.\n  In the special case, arising in wire forming manufacturing, that each joint\ncan be altered at most once, and must be done sequentially from one or both\nends of the linkage, we give an efficient algorithm to determine if a linkage\ncan be straightened."

The aspect ratio of a polygon is the ratio of the diameters\nof the smallest circumscribing circle to the largest inscribed disk. The\nproblem is rich even for partitioning regular polygons into convex pieces, the\nfocus of this paper. We show that the optimal (most circular) partition for an\nequilateral triangle has an infinite number of pieces, with the lower bound\napproachable to any accuracy desired by a particular finite partition. For\npentagons and all regular k-gons, k > 5, the unpartitioned polygon is already\noptimal. The square presents an interesting intermediate case. Here the\none-piece partition is not optimal, but nor is the trivial lower bound\napproachable. We narrow the optimal ratio to an aspect-ratio gap of 0.01082\nwith several somewhat intricate partitions."

We present algorithms that work for a large family of shapes, provided\neither only translations and no rotations are allowed, or only rotation about a\nfixed point is allowed; that is, one is allowed to only scale and translate a\ngiven shape, or scale and rotate the shape around a fixed point. Our algorithms\nstart with a polytope guessed to be of optimal size and iteratively moves it\nbased on a greedy principle: simply move the current polytope directly towards\nany outside point till it touches the surface. For computing the minimum\nenclosing ball, this gives a simple greedy algorithm with running time\n$O(nd/\\eps)$ producing a ball of radius $1+\\eps$ times the optimal. This simple\nprinciple generalizes to arbitrary convex shape when only translations are\nallowed, requiring at most $O(1/\\eps^2)$ iterations. Our algorithm implies that\n{\\em core-sets} of size $O(1/\\eps^2)$ exist not only for minimum enclosing ball\nbut also for any convex shape with a fixed orientation.

In this paper we\nanalyze the Delaunay depth function, which is sensitive to multimodality and\ncompare this depth with others, as convex depth and location depth. We study\nthe stratification that Delaunay depth induces in the point set (layers) and in\nthe whole plane (levels), and we develop an algorithm for computing the\nDelaunay depth contours, associated to a point set in the plane, with running\ntime O(n log^2 n). The depth of a query point p with respect to a data set S in\nthe plane is the depth of p in the union of S and p. When S and p are given in\nthe input the Delaunay depth can be computed in O(n log n), and we prove that\nthis value is optimal."

    "summary": "Anomaly detection has important applications in biosurveilance and\nenvironmental monitoring. When comparing measured data to data drawn from a\nbaseline distribution, merely, finding clusters in the measured data may not\nactually represent true anomalies. These clusters may likely be the clusters of\nthe baseline distribution. Hence, a discrepancy function is often used to\nexamine how different measured data is to baseline data within a region. An\nanomalous region is thus defined to be one with high discrepancy.\n  In this paper, we present algorithms for maximizing statistical discrepancy\nfunctions over the space of axis-parallel rectangles. We give provable\napproximation guarantees, both additive and relative, and our methods apply to\nany convex discrepancy function. Our algorithms work by connecting statistical\ndiscrepancy to combinatorial discrepancy; roughly speaking, we show that in\norder to maximize a convex discrepancy function over a class of shapes, one\nneeds only maximize a linear discrepancy function over the same set of shapes.\n  We derive general discrepancy functions for data generated from a one-\nparameter exponential family. This generalizes the widely-used Kulldorff scan\nstatistic for data from a Poisson distribution. We present an algorithm running\nin $O(\\smash[tb]{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} n^2 \\log^2 n})$ that computes the maximum\ndiscrepancy rectangle to within additive error $\\epsilon$, for the Kulldorff\nscan statistic. Similar results hold for relative error and for discrepancy\nfunctions for data coming from Gaussian, Bernoulli, and gamma distributions.\nPrior to our work, the best known algorithms were exact and ran in time\n$\\smash[t]{O(n^4)}$."

Finally, we give an O(n^2 log n)\nalgorithm for preprocessing the data so that one can obtain the illumination\nrange needed to 1-well illuminate a point of a line segment in O(log n) time.\nThese results can be applied to solve problems of 1-well illuminating a\ntrajectory by approaching it to a polygonal path."

    "summary": "A continuum description of unstructured meshes in two dimensions, both for\nplanar and curved surface domains, is proposed. The meshes described are those\nwhich, in the limit of an increasingly finer mesh (smaller cells), and away\nfrom irregular vertices, have ideally-shaped cells (squares or equilateral\ntriangles), and can therefore be completely described by two local properties:\nlocal cell size and local edge directions. The connection between the two\nproperties is derived by defining a Riemannian manifold whose geodesics trace\nthe edges of the mesh. A function $\\phi$, proportional to the logarithm of the\ncell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges\ncorresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold\nfor a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson\nproblem on $\\phi$, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to\nthe conditions derived for boundary alignment. Possible applications to mesh\ngeneration are discussed."

We\nderive this criterion from our generalization of Van Heijenoort's (1952)\ntheorem on locally convex hypersurfaces in $R^n$ to spherical spaces. We also\ngive an easy-to-implement convexity testing algorithm, which is based on our\ncriterion. For $R^3$ the number of arithmetic operations used by the algorithm\nis at most linear in the number of vertices, while in general it is at most\nlinear in the number of incidences between the $(n-2)$-faces and $(n-3)$-faces.\nWhen the dimension $n$ is not fixed and only ring arithmetic is allowed, the\nalgorithm still remains polynomial. Our method works in more general situations\nthan the convexity verification algorithms developed by Mehlhorn et al. (1996)\nand Devillers et al. (1998) -- for example, our method does not require the\ninput surface to be orientable, nor it requires the input data to include\nnormal vectors to the facets that are oriented \"in a coherent way\". For $R^3$\nthe complexity of our algorithm is the same as that of previous algorithms; for\nhigher dimensions there seems to be no clear winner, but our approach is the\nonly one that easily handles inputs in which the facet normals are not known to\nbe coherently oriented or are not given at all. Furthermore, our method can be\nextended to piecewise-polynomial surfaces of small degree."

We prove that these\n\\emph{Euclidean rhythms} have the mathematical property that their onset\npatterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the\nEuclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a\ncircle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this\nnotion of \\emph{evenness}. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms\nare \\emph{deep}: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique\nmultiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k-1$. Finally,\nwe characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of\ngenerated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All\nof our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales.

We show theoretically and experimentally that, if the\nsimplification algorithm A used between any two successive levels of resolution\nsatisfies some conditions, the multiresolution algorithm MR will have a\ncomplexity lower than the complexity of A. In particular, we show that if A has\na O(N2/K) complexity (the complexity of a reduced search dynamic solution\napproach), where N and K are respectively the initial and the final number of\nsegments, the complexity of MR is in O(N).We experimentally compare the\noutcomes of MR with those of the optimal \"full search\" dynamic programming\nsolution and of classical merge and split approaches. The experimental\nevaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed\napproach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either shows a lower complexity or\nprovides polygonal approximations closer to the initial curves."

    "summary": "The Voronoi diagram of a finite set of objects is a fundamental geometric\nstructure that subdivides the embedding space into regions, each region\nconsisting of the points that are closer to a given object than to the others.\nWe may define many variants of Voronoi diagrams depending on the class of\nobjects, the distance functions and the embedding space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a framework for defining and building Voronoi diagrams for a broad\nclass of distance functions called Bregman divergences. Bregman divergences\ninclude not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various\ndivergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi\ndiagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical\nparametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define\nseveral types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those\ndiagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them\nefficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and\nk-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set\nof points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these\ntriangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay\ntriangulation. Finally, we give some applications of Bregman Voronoi diagrams\nwhich are of interest in the context of computational geometry and machine\nlearning."

Our result generalizes and indeed\nbuilds upon the result from 1814 that polygons have common dissections (without\nhinges). We also extend our common dissection result to edge-hinged dissections\nof solid 3D polyhedra that have a common (unhinged) dissection, as determined\nby Dehn's 1900 solution to Hilbert's Third Problem. Our proofs are\nconstructive, giving explicit algorithms in all cases. For a constant number of\nplanar polygons, both the number of pieces and running time required by our\nconstruction are pseudopolynomial. This bound is the best possible, even for\nunhinged dissections. Hinged dissections have possible applications to\nreconfigurable robotics, programmable matter, and nanomanufacturing."

Moreover, an\n$O(n\\log{}n)$ time and O(n) space algorithm is described that produces a vertex\nguarding set of size at most $\\lfloor\\frac{2n}{3}\\rfloor$.

In the special case of monotone piecewise-convex\npolygons we can show that $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ vertex guards are always\nsufficient and sometimes necessary; these bounds remain valid even if we allow\npoint guards.\n  In the case of piecewise-concave polygons, we show that $2n-4$ point guards\nare always sufficient and sometimes necessary, whereas it might not be possible\nto guard such polygons by vertex guards.

    "summary": "We introduce staged self-assembly of Wang tiles, where tiles can be added\ndynamically in sequence and where intermediate constructions can be stored for\nlater mixing. This model and its various constraints and performance measures\nare motivated by a practical nanofabrication scenario through protein-based\nbioengineering. Staging allows us to break through the traditional lower bounds\nin tile self-assembly by encoding the shape in the staging algorithm instead of\nthe tiles. All of our results are based on the practical assumption that only a\nconstant number of glues, and thus only a constant number of tiles, can be\nengineered, as each new glue type requires significant biochemical research and\nexperiments. Under this assumption, traditional tile self-assembly cannot even\nmanufacture an n*n square; in contrast, we show how staged assembly enables\nmanufacture of arbitrary orthogonal shapes in a variety of precise formulations\nof the model."

Our algorithm is the first spacetime meshing algorithm\nsuitable for efficient solution of nonlinear phenomena in anisotropic media\nusing novel discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods for implicit\nsolutions directly in spacetime. Given a triangulated d-dimensional Euclidean\nspace domain M (a simplicial complex) and initial conditions of the underlying\nhyperbolic spacetime PDE, we construct an unstructured simplicial mesh of the\n(d+1)-dimensional spacetime domain M x [0,infinity). Our algorithm uses a\nnear-optimal number of spacetime elements, each with bounded temporal aspect\nratio for any finite prefix M x [0,T] of spacetime. Our algorithm is an\nadvancing front procedure that constructs the spacetime mesh incrementally, an\nextension of the Tent Pitcher algorithm of Ungor and Sheffer (2000).\n  In 2DxTime, our algorithm simultaneously adapts the size and shape of\nspacetime tetrahedra to a spacetime error indicator.

When the PDEs are nonlinear, the\nspeed of propagation of the phenomena, called the wavespeed, at any point in\nthe spacetime domain is computed as part of the solution. We give an advancing\nfront algorithm to construct a simplicial mesh of the spacetime domain suitable\nfor DG solutions. Given a simplicial mesh of a bounded linear or planar space\ndomain M, we incrementally construct a mesh of the spacetime domain M x\n[0,infinity) such that the solution can be computed in constant time per\nelement. We add a patch of spacetime elements to the mesh at every step. The\nboundary of every patch is causal which means that the elements in the patch\ncan be solved immediately and that the patches in the mesh are partially\nordered by dependence. The elements in a single patch are coupled because they\nshare implicit faces; however, the number of elements in each patch is bounded.\nThe main contribution of this paper is sufficient constraints on the progress\nin time made by the algorithm at each step which guarantee that a new patch\nwith causal boundary can be added to the mesh at every step even when the\nwavespeed is increasing discontinuously.

We\nfirst address voxel-based polyhedra (polycubes), formed as the union of a\ncollection of cubical (axis-aligned) voxels. We analyze the ways in which the\nskeleton may intersect each voxel of the polyhedron, and show that the skeleton\nmay be constructed by a simple voxel-sweeping algorithm taking constant time\nper voxel. In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight\nskeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area\nof the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the\npolyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges\nand faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight\nskeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the\nstraight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k\nis the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general\nnonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a\nconsistent method to resolve it. We prove that the straight skeleton of a\ngeneral polyhedron has a superquadratic complexity in the worst case. Finally,\nwe report on an implementation of a simple algorithm for the general case."

Indeed, based on the a number\nof experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States\nand District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road\nnetworks are quite non-planar. Our approach therefore instead is directed at\nfinding algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as non-planar\ngeometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of road networks that can\nstill lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and\nVoronoi diagrams. In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed\ngraphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems.\nThis approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without\nmaking any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights. In\nfact, our algorithms can allow for non-metric weights."

We restrict the query line to be horizontal in\nthe first special case, which we preprocess in $O(n \\alpha(n) \\log n)$ time and\nspace, where $\\alpha(n)$ is the slow growing inverse of the Ackermann's\nfunction. When the query line is restricted to pass through a fixed point, the\nsecond special case, our preprocessing takes $O(n \\alpha(n)^{O(\\alpha(n))} \\log\nn)$ time and space.

    "summary": "A rectangular layout is a partition of a rectangle into a finite set of\ninterior-disjoint rectangles. Rectangular layouts appear in various\napplications: as rectangular cartograms in cartography, as floorplans in\nbuilding architecture and VLSI design, and as graph drawings. Often areas are\nassociated with the rectangles of a rectangular layout and it might hence be\ndesirable if one rectangular layout can represent several area assignments. A\nlayout is area-universal if any assignment of areas to rectangles can be\nrealized by a combinatorially equivalent rectangular layout. We identify a\nsimple necessary and sufficient condition for a rectangular layout to be\narea-universal: a rectangular layout is area-universal if and only if it is\none-sided. More generally, given any rectangular layout L and any assignment of\nareas to its regions, we show that there can be at most one layout (up to\nhorizontal and vertical scaling) which is combinatorially equivalent to L and\nachieves a given area assignment. We also investigate similar questions for\nperimeter assignments. The adjacency requirements for the rectangles of a\nrectangular layout can be specified in various ways, most commonly via the dual\ngraph of the layout. We show how to find an area-universal layout for a given\nset of adjacency requirements whenever such a layout exists."

Specifically, we show: (i) The\nmaximum possible number of incidences between $n$ lines in $\\reals^3$ and $m$\nof their joints (points incident to at least three non-coplanar lines) is\n$\\Theta(m^{1/3}n)$ for $m\\ge n$, and $\\Theta(m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)$ for $m\\le n$.\n(ii) In particular, the number of such incidences cannot exceed $O(n^{3/2})$.\n(iii) The bound in (i) also holds for incidences between $n$ lines and $m$\narbitrary points (not necessarily joints), provided that no plane contains more\nthan O(n) points and each point is incident to at least three lines. As a\npreliminary step, we give a simpler proof of (an extension of) the bound\n$O(n^{3/2})$, established by Guth and Katz, on the number of joints in a set of\n$n$ lines in $\\reals^3$.

This bound has been expressed as\nO(n^{2+2alpha+epsilon}), and the current best value for alpha is ~0.068.\n  Our algorithm finds polygons with O(n^alpha) edges by sweeping a line through\nthe set of points, while larger polygons are found by random sampling. We can\nfind all regular polygons with high probability in O(n^{2+alpha+epsilon})\nexpected time for every positive epsilon. This compares well to the\nO(n^{2+2alpha+epsilon}) deterministic algorithm of Brass."

    "summary": "The minimum feature size of a crossing-free straight line drawing is the\nminimum distance between a vertex and a non-incident edge. This quantity\nmeasures the resolution needed to display a figure or the tool size needed to\nmill the figure. The spread is the ratio of the diameter to the minimum feature\nsize. While many algorithms (particularly in meshing) depend on the spread of\nthe input, none explicitly consider finding a mesh whose spread is similar to\nthe input. When a polygon is partitioned into smaller regions, such as\ntriangles or quadrangles, the degradation is the ratio of original to final\nspread (the final spread is always greater).\n  Here we present an algorithm to quadrangulate a simple n-gon, while achieving\nconstant degradation. Note that although all faces have a quadrangular shape,\nthe number of edges bounding each face may be larger. This method uses Theta(n)\nSteiner points and produces Theta(n) quadrangles. In fact to obtain constant\ndegradation, Omega(n) Steiner points are required by any algorithm.\n  We also show that, for some polygons, a constant factor cannot be achieved by\nany triangulation, even with an unbounded number of Steiner points. The\nspecific lower bounds depend on whether Steiner vertices are used or not."

    "summary": "Let $G$ be a (possibly disconnected) planar subdivision and let $D$ be a\nprobability measure over $\\R^2$. The current paper shows how to preprocess\n$(G,D)$ into an O(n) size data structure that can answer planar point location\nqueries over $G$. The expected query time of this data structure, for a query\npoint drawn according to $D$, is $O(H+1)$, where $H$ is a lower bound on the\nexpected query time of any linear decision tree for point location in $G$. This\nextends the results of Collette et al (2008, 2009) from connected planar\nsubdivisions to disconnected planar subdivisions. A version of this structure,\nwhen combined with existing results on succinct point location, provides a\nsuccinct distribution-sensitive point location structure."

We then apply the technique of Bronnimann and Goodrich to build an\napproximation algorithm from this epsilon-net finder. Along with a simple\npolygon P, our algorithm takes as input a finite set of potential guard\nlocations that must include the polygon's vertices. If a finite set of\npotential guard locations is not specified, e.g. when guards may be placed\nanywhere on the perimeter, we use a known discretization technique at the cost\nof making the algorithm's running time potentially linear in the ratio between\nthe longest and shortest distances between vertices.

However, the number of\nvertices for sums of more polytopes was unknown so far. In this paper, we study\nsums of polytopes in general orientations, and show a linear relation between\nthe number of faces of a sum of $r$ polytopes in dimension $d$, with $r\\geq d$,\nand the number of faces in the sums of less than $d$ of the summand polytopes.\nWe deduce from this exact formula a tight bound on the maximum possible number\nof vertices of the Minkowski sum of any number of polytopes in any dimension.\nIn particular, the linear relation implies that a sum of $r$ polytopes in\ndimension $d$ has a number of vertices in $O(n^{d-1})$ of the total number of\nvertices in the summands, even when $r\\geq d$. This bound is tight, in the\nsense that some sums do have that many vertices."

For a set T of n points (terminals) in R^2, a B-Manhattan network on T is a\nnetwork N(T) = (V,E) with the property that its edges are parallel to the\ndirections of B and for every pair of terminals t_i and t_j, the network N(T)\ncontains a shortest B-path between them, i.e., a path of length || t_i - t_j\n||. A minimum B-Manhattan network on T is a B-Manhattan network of minimum\npossible length. The problem of finding minimum B-Manhattan networks has been\nintroduced by Gudmundsson, Levcopoulos, and Narasimhan (APPROX'99) in the case\nwhen the unit ball B is a square (and hence the distance || p - q || is the l_1\nor the l_infty-distance between p and q) and it has been shown recently by\nChin, Guo, and Sun (SoCG'09) to be strongly NP-complete. Several approximation\nalgorithms (with factors 8, 4 ,3 , and 2) for minimum Manhattan problem are\nknown.

It has long\nbeen conjectured that the dilation in T of any pair p, p \\in P, which is the\nratio of the length of the shortest path from p to p' in T over the Euclidean\ndistance ||pp'||, can be at most {\\pi}/2 \\approx 1.5708. In this paper, we show\nhow to construct point sets in convex position with dilation > 1.5810 and in\ngeneral position with dilation > 1.5846.

We identify 21 relevant geometric constraints and develop the\ncorresponding infinitesimal rigidity theory for these structures. The classical\nbody-and-bar rigidity model can be viewed as a body-and-cad structure that uses\nonly one constraint from this new class.

The popular Treemap\nalgorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into\nrectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in\n$\\mathcal{T}$ is equal to the weight of that node. The aspect ratio of the\nrectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights\nand can become arbitrarily high.\n  We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal\npartition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present\ntwo methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on\nthe worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both\nmethods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the\nweights of the nodes.\n  We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the\nrectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We\nshow that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect\nratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics\ninto $d$-dimensional Euclidean space: we give a $\\mathop{\\rm\npolylog}(\\Delta)$-approximation algorithm for embedding $n$-point ultrametrics\ninto $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with minimum distortion, where $\\Delta$ denotes the spread\nof the metric, i.e., the ratio between the largest and the smallest distance\nbetween two points. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this\nproblem was polynomial in $n$. This is the first algorithm for embedding a\nnon-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension\nthat achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio."

    "summary": "The problem of combinatorially determining the rank of the 3-dimensional\nbar-joint {\\em rigidity matroid} of a graph is an important open problem in\ncombinatorial rigidity theory. Maxwell's condition states that the edges of a\ngraph $G=(V, E)$ are {\\em independent} in its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity\nmatroid only if $(a)$ the number of edges $|E|$ $\\le$ $d|V| - {d+1\\choose 2}$,\nand $(b)$ this holds for every induced subgraph with at least $d$ vertices. We\ncall such graphs {\\em Maxwell-independent} in $d$ dimensions. Laman's theorem\nshows that the converse holds for $d=2$ and thus every maximal\nMaxwell-independent set of $G$ has size equal to the rank of the 2-dimensional\ngeneric rigidity matroid. While this is false for $d=3$, we show that every\nmaximal, Maxwell-independent set of a graph $G$ has size at least the rank of\nthe 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid of $G$. This answers a question\nposed by Tib\\'or Jord\\'an at the 2008 rigidity workshop at BIRS\n\\cite{bib:birs}.\n  Along the way, we construct subgraphs (1) that yield alternative formulae for\na rank upper bound for Maxwell-independent graphs and (2) that contain a\nmaximal (true) independent set.

In this paper sharp inequalities between core-radii for general\ncontainment under homothetics are obtained. Moreover, the presented\ninequalities are used to derive sharp upper bounds on the size of core-sets for\ncontainment under homothetics. In the MEB case, this yields a tight (dimension\nindependent) bound for the size of such core-sets.

For this version of the algorithm we show that only two pairwise\ncomparisons are required in the combine step, for each point that lies in the 2\ndelta-wide vertical slab. The correctness of the algorithm is shown for all\nMinkowski distances with p>=1. We also show empirically that, although the time\ncomplexity of the algorithm is still O(n lg n), the reduction in the total\nnumber of comparisons leads to a significant reduction in the total execution\ntime, for inputs with size sufficiently large."

    "summary": "This paper concerns the forward kinematics and tension distribution of\nsinking winches mechanism, which is a type of four-cable-driven partly\nconstrained parallel robot. Conventional studies on forward kinematics of\ncable-driven parallel robot assumed that all cables are taut. Actually, given\nthe lengths of four cables, some cables may be slack when the platform is in\nstatic equilibrium. Therefore, in this paper, the tension state (tautness or\nslackness) of cables is considered in the forward kinematics model. We propose\nTraversal-Solving-Algorithm, which can indicate the tension state of cables,\nand further determine the pose of the platform, if the lengths of four cables\nare given. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by four examples. The\nresults of this paper can be used to control sinking winches mechanism to\nachieve the level and stable motion of the platform, and to make the tension\ndistribution of cables as uniform as possible."

A treemap for $\\tree$ is a hierarchical partition of a\nrectangle into simply connected regions, usually rectangles. Each region\nrepresents a node of $\\tree$ and its area is proportional to the weight of the\ncorresponding node. An important quality criterion for treemaps is the aspect\nratio of its regions. One cannot bound the aspect ratio if the regions are\nrestricted to be rectangles. In contrast, \\emph{polygonal partitions}, that use\nconvex polygons, have bounded aspect ratio. We are the first to obtain convex\npartitions with optimal aspect ratio $O(\\depth(\\tree))$. However,\n$\\depth(\\tree)$ still depends on the input tree. Hence we introduce a new type\nof treemaps, namely \\emph{orthoconvex treemaps}, where regions representing\nleaves are rectangles, L-, and S-shapes, and regions representing internal\nnodes are orthoconvex polygons. We prove that any input tree, irrespective of\nthe weights of the nodes and the depth of the tree, admits an orthoconvex\ntreemap of constant aspect ratio. We also obtain several specialized results\nfor single-level treemaps, that is, treemaps where the input tree has depth~1."

    "summary": "For a polygon P with n vertices, the vertex guarding problem asks for the\nminimum subset G of P's vertices such that every point in P is seen by at least\none point in G. This problem is NP-complete and APX-hard. The first\napproximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells\nthat are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This\ndiscretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved\nin O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm. Ghosh (2010)\nrecently revisited the algorithm, noting that minimum visibility decompositions\nfor simple polygons (Bose et al., 2000) have only O(n^3) cells, improving the\nrunning time of the algorithm to O(n^4) for simple polygons.\n  In this paper we show that, since minimum visibility decompositions for\nsimple polygons have only O(n^2) cells of minimal visibility (Bose et al.,\n2000), the running time of the algorithm can be further improved to O(n^3).\nThis result was obtained independently by Jang and Kwon (2011). We extend the\nresult of Bose et al. to polygons with holes, showing that a minimum visibility\ndecomposition of a polygon with h holes has only O((h+1)n^3) cells and only\nO((h+1)^2 n^2) cells of minimal visibility. We exploit this result to obtain a\nfaster algorithm for vertex guarding polygons with holes. We then show that, in\nthe same time complexity, we can attain approximation factors of O(log\nlog(opt)) for simple polygons and O((1+\\log((h+1))) log(opt)) for polygons with\nholes."

    "summary": "Given a convex region in the plane, and a sweep-line as a tool, what is best\nway to reduce the region to a single point by a sequence of sweeps? The problem\nof sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [2]. Here we\nconsider the following \\emph{slanted} variant of sweeping recently introduced\nin [1]: In a single sweep, the sweep-line is placed at a start position\nsomewhere in the plane, then moved continuously according to a sweep vector\n$\\vec v$ (not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line) to another parallel end\nposition, and then lifted from the plane. The cost of a sequence of sweeps is\nthe sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors. The (optimal) sweeping cost of a\nregion is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that\nregion. An optimal sweeping sequence for a region is one with a minimum total\ncost, if it exists. Another parameter of interest is the number of sweeps.\n  We show that there exist convex regions for which the optimal sweeping cost\ncannot be attained by two sweeps. This disproves a conjecture of Bousany,\nKarker, O'Rourke, and Sparaco stating that two sweeps (with vectors along the\ntwo adjacent sides of a minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram) always\nsuffice [1]. Moreover, we conjecture that for some convex regions, no finite\nsweeping sequence is optimal. On the other hand, we show that both the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing rectangle and the 2-sweep\nalgorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram achieve a $4/\\pi\n\\approx 1.27$ approximation in this sweeping model."

If we further\nassume that the points are \"oblivious\" with respect to the data structure, the\nrunning time improves to O(n alpha(n)). The analysis applies almost verbatim\nwhen L is a set of line-segments, and yields similar asymptotic bounds. We\npresent several extensions, including a trade-off between space and query time\nand an output-sensitive algorithm. We also study the \"dual problem\" where we\nshow how to efficiently compute the (<= k)-level of n lines in the plane, each\nof which lies on a distinct point (given in advance).\n  We complement our results by Omega(n log n) lower bounds under the algebraic\ncomputation tree model for several related problems, including sorting a set of\npoints (according to, say, their x-order), each of which lies on a given line\nknown in advance. Therefore, the convex hull problem under our setting is\neasier than sorting, contrary to the \"standard\" convex hull and sorting\nproblems, in which the two problems require Theta(n log n) steps in the worst\ncase (under the algebraic computation tree model)."

There are two notions of discrepancy, namely continuous\ndiscrepancy and combinatorial discrepancy. Depending on the ranges, several\npossible variants arise, for example star discrepancy, box discrepancy, and\ndiscrepancy of half-spaces. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these\nproblems with respect to the dimension d of the underlying space.\n  All these problems are solvable in time {n^O(d)}, but such a time dependency\nquickly becomes intractable for high-dimensional data. Thus it is interesting\nto ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated.\n  We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision\nproblems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a\nparameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear\nin the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require\n{n^\\Omega(d)} time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in {2^o(n)} time.\n  Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an {\\epsilon}-net with\nrespect to half-spaces takes {n^\\Omega(d)} time under the same assumption. As\nintermediate results, we discover the W[1]-hardness of other well known\nproblems, such as determining the largest empty star inside the unit cube. For\nthis, we show that it is even hard to approximate within a factor of {2^n}."

We compute\na (3+\\eps)-approximation to the minimum Fr\\'echet distance over all possible\nsuch shortcuts, in near linear time, if the curve is c-packed and the number of\nshortcuts is either small or unbounded.\n  To facilitate the new algorithm we develop several new tools:\n  (A) A data structure for preprocessing a curve (not necessarily c-packed)\nthat supports (1+\\eps)-approximate Fr\\'echet distance queries between a\nsubcurve (of the original curve) and a line segment.\n  (B) A near linear time algorithm that computes a permutation of the vertices\nof a curve, such that any prefix of 2k-1 vertices of this permutation, form an\noptimal approximation (up to a constant factor) to the original curve compared\nto any polygonal curve with k vertices, for any k > 0.\n  (C) A data structure for preprocessing a curve that supports approximate\nFr\\'echet distance queries between a subcurve and query polygonal curve. The\nquery time depends quadratically on the complexity of the query curve, and only\n(roughly) logarithmically on the complexity of the original curve.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first data structures to support these kind\nof queries efficiently."

Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we describe, in algorithmic\nterms, how to compute the Incircle predicate for axes-aligned line segments,\nand secondly we compute its algebraic degree. Our primary aim is to minimize\nthe algebraic degree, while, at the same time, taking into account the amount\nof operations needed to compute our predicate of interest.\n  In our predicate analysis we show that the Incircle predicate can be answered\nby evaluating the signs of algebraic expressions of degree at most 6; this is\nhalf the algebraic degree we get when we evaluate the Incircle predicate using\nthe current state-of-the-art approach. In the most demanding cases of our\npredicate evaluation, we reduce the problem of answering the Incircle predicate\nto the problem of computing the sign of the value of a linear polynomial (in\none variable), when evaluated at a known specific root of a quadratic\npolynomial (again in one variable). Another important aspect of our approach is\nthat, from a geometric point of view, we answer the most difficult case of the\npredicate via implicitly performing point locations on an appropriately defined\nsubdivision of the place induced by the Voronoi circle implicated in the\nIncircle predicate."

    "summary": "Let P be a set of points in the plane, representing directional antennas of\nangle a and range r. The coverage area of the antenna at point p is a circular\nsector of angle a and radius r, whose orientation is adjustable. For a given\norientation assignment, the induced symmetric communication graph (SCG) of P is\nthe undirected graph that contains the edge (u,v) iff v lies in u's sector and\nvice versa. In this paper we ask what is the smallest angle a for which there\nexists an integer n=n(a), such that for any set P of n antennas of angle a and\nunbounded range, one can orient the antennas so that the induced SCG is\nconnected, and the union of the corresponding wedges is the entire plane. We\nshow that the answer to this problem is a=\\pi/2, for which n=4. Moreover, we\nprove that if Q_1 and Q_2 are quadruplets of antennas of angle \\pi/2 and\nunbounded range, separated by a line, to which one applies the above\nconstruction, independently, then the induced SCG of Q_1 \\cup Q_2 is connected.\nThis latter result enables us to apply the construction locally, and to solve\nthe following two further problems.\n  In the first problem, we are given a connected unit disk graph (UDG),\ncorresponding to a set P of omni-directional antennas of range 1, and the goal\nis to replace these antennas by directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and range\nr=O(1) and to orient them, such that the induced SCG is connected, and,\nmoreover, is an O(1)-spanner of the UDG, w.r.t. hop distance. In our solution r\n= 14\\sqrt{2} and the spanning ratio is 8. In the second problem, we are given a\nset P of directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and adjustable range. The goal is\nto assign to each antenna p, an orientation and a range r_p, such that the\nresulting SCG is connected, and \\sum_{p \\in P} r_p^\\beta is minimized, where\n\\beta \\ge 1 is a constant.

The countries in\ncircular-arc cartograms have the aesthetically pleasing appearance of clouds or\nsnowflakes, depending on whether their edges are bent outwards or inwards. This\nmakes it easy to determine whether a country has grown or shrunk, just by its\noverall shape. We show that determining whether a given map and given\narea-values can be realized as a circular-arc cartogram is an NP-hard problem.\nNext we describe a heuristic method for constructing circular-arc cartograms,\nwhich uses a max-flow computation on the dual graph of the map, along with a\ncomputation of the straight skeleton of the underlying polygonal decomposition.\nOur method is implemented and produces cartograms that, while not yet perfectly\naccurate, achieve many of the desired areas in our real-world examples."

The underlying graphs\nG satisfy the following: for some base non-edge f, G \\cup f is\nquadratic-radically solvable (QRS), meaning that G \\cup f is minimally rigid,\nand given lengths \\bar{l} of all edges, the corresponding linkage (G \\cup f,\n\\bar{l}) can be simply realized by ruler and compass starting from f. It is\nclear that the Cayley complexity only depends on the graph G and possibly the\nnon-edge f. Here we ask whether the Cayley complexity depends on the choice of\na base non-edge f. We answer this question in the negative, thereby showing\nthat low Cayley complexity is a property of the graph G (independent of the\nnon-edge f).\n  Then, we give a simple characterization of graphs with low Cayley complexity,\nleading to an efficient algorithmic characterization, i.e. an efficient\nalgorithm for recognizing such graphs.\n  Next, we show a surprising result that (graph) planarity is equivalent to low\nCayley complexity for a natural subclass of 1-dof triangle-decomposable graphs.\nWhile this is a finite forbidden minor graph characterization of low Cayley\ncomplexity, we provide counterexamples showing impossibility of such finite\nforbidden minor characterizations when the above subclass is enlarged."

The reason is the following conflict: On the one hand,\ncomputing with rounded arithmetic may question the reliability of programs\nwhile, on the other hand, computing with exact arithmetic may be too expensive\nand hence inefficient. One solution is the implementation of controlled\nperturbation algorithms which combine the speed of floating-point arithmetic\nwith a protection mechanism that guarantees reliability, nonetheless.\n  This paper is concerned with the performance analysis of controlled\nperturbation algorithms in theory. We answer this question with the\npresentation of a general analysis tool box. This tool box is separated into\nindependent components which are presented individually with their interfaces.\nThis way, the tool box supports alternative approaches for the derivation of\nthe most crucial bounds. We present three approaches for this task.\nFurthermore, we have thoroughly reworked the concept of controlled perturbation\nin order to include rational function based predicates into the theory;\npolynomial based predicates are included anyway. Even more we introduce\nobject-preserving perturbations. Moreover, the tool box is designed such that\nit reflects the actual behavior of the controlled perturbation algorithm at\nhand without any simplifying assumptions."

At\nthe heart of this problem is a data structures question: How can we preprocess\na set of n lines so that we can quickly test whether a randomly selected vertex\nin the arrangement of these lines is above or below the median level. We\ndescribe a Monte-Carlo data structure for this problem that can be constructed\nin O(nlog n) time, can answer queries O((log n)^{4/3}) expected time, and\nanswers correctly with high probability."

A flip in T is the operation of\nremoving one diagonal of T and adding a different one such that the resulting\ngraph is again a triangulation. The flip distance between two triangulations is\nthe smallest number of flips required to transform one triangulation into the\nother. For the special case of convex polygons, the problem of determining the\nshortest flip distance between two triangulations is equivalent to determining\nthe rotation distance between two binary trees, a central problem which is\nstill open after over 25 years of intensive study. We show that computing the\nflip distance between two triangulations of a simple polygon is NP-complete.\nThis complements a recent result that shows APX-hardness of determining the\nflip distance between two triangulations of a planar point set."

    "summary": "Recently, a new way of avoiding crossings in straight-line drawings of\nnon-planar graphs has been investigated. The idea of partial edge drawings\n(PED) is to drop the middle part of edges and rely on the remaining edge parts\ncalled stubs. We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs\nof an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint\nof an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence. We also consider an\nadditional homogeneity constraint that forces the stub lengths to be a given\nfraction $\\delta$ of the edge lengths ($\\delta$-SHPED). Given length and\ndirection of a stub, this model helps to infer the position of the opposite\nstub.\n  We show that, for a fixed stub--edge length ratio $\\delta$, not all graphs\nhave a $\\delta$-SHPED. Specifically, we show that $K_{241}$ does not have a\n1/4-SHPED, while bandwidth-$k$ graphs always have a $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{k})$-SHPED.\nWe also give bounds for complete bipartite graphs. Further, we consider the\nproblem \\textsc{MaxSPED} where the task is to compute the SPED of maximum total\nstub length that a given straight-line drawing contains. We present an\nefficient solution for 2-planar drawings and a 2-approximation algorithm for\nthe dual problem."

Similar generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are\ndescribed for several variants of Peano's curve (the original Peano curve, the\ncoil curve, the half-coil curve, and the Meurthe curve). The d-dimensional\nharmonious Hilbert curves and the Meurthe curves have neutral orientation: as\ncompared to the curve as a whole, arbitrary pieces of the curve have each of d!\npossible rotations with equal probability. Thus one could say these curves are\n`statistically invariant' under rotation---unlike the Peano curves, the coil\ncurves, the half-coil curves, and the familiar generalization of Hilbert curves\nby Butz and Moore.\n  In addition, prompted by an application in the construction of R-trees, this\npaper shows how to construct a 2d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano\ncurve that traverses the points of a certain d-dimensional diagonally placed\nsubspace in the order of a given d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano\ncurve.\n  Pseudocode is provided for comparison operators based on the curves presented\nin this paper."

    "summary": "Polygon clipping is a frequent operation in Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian\nmethods, Computer Graphics, GIS, and CAD. In fact, clipping algorithms are said\nto be one of the most important operations in computer graphics. Thus,\nefficient and general polygon clipping algorithms are of great importance.\nGreiner et al. developed a time efficient algorithm which could clip arbitrary\npolygons, including concave and self intersecting polygons. However, the\nGreiner-Hormann algorithm does not properly handle degenerate cases, without\nthe undesirable need for perturbing vertices. We present an extension to the\nGreiner-Hormann polygon clipping algorithm which properly deals with degenerate\ncases. We combine the method proposed by Kim et al. and the method mentioned by\nLiu et al. to remove or properly label degenerate cases. Additionally, the\nalgorithm presented avoids the need for calculating midpoints, doesn't require\nadditional entry/exit flags, and avoids changing the vertex data structure used\nin the original Greiner-Hormann algorithm, which was required by the extension\npresented by Kim et al."

Such range spaces are called\n\"well behaved\". Our bound is an improvement over the bound O(\\log{(1/p)/\\eps^2\np) introduced by Li etal. for the general case (where this bound has been shown\nto be tight in the worst case), when p << Epsilon. We also show that such small\nsize relative (p,Epsilon)-approximations can be constructed in expected\npolynomial time.\n  Our bound also has an interesting interpretation in the context of \"p-nets\":\nAs observed by Har-Peled and Sharir, p-nets are special cases of relative\n(p,Epsilon)-approximations. Specifically, when Epsilon is a constant smaller\nthan 1, their analysis implies that there are p-nets of size O(\\log{(1/p)}/p)\nthat are \\emph{also} relative approximations. In this context our construction\nsignificantly improves this bound for well-behaved range spaces. Despite the\nprogress in the theory of p-nets and the existence of improved bounds\ncorresponding to the cases that we study, these bounds do not necessarily\nguarantee a bounded relative error.\n  Lastly, we present several geometric scenarios of well-behaved range spaces,\nand show the resulting bound for each of these cases obtained as a consequence\nof our analysis. In particular, when Epsilon is a constant smaller than 1, our\nbound for points and axis-parallel boxes in two and three dimensions, as well\nas points and \"fat\" triangles in the plane, matches the optimal bound for\np-nets."

We formulate the ASP as\na partitioning problem of a set of moving points in a polygonal domain. In\naddition to the requirement of balancing the workload, we introduce\nrestrictions on the geometry of the sectorization which come from the Air\nTraffic Management aspects. We investigate several versions of the problem that\narise from different definitions of the notion of the workload and various\nchoices of geometric restrictions on the sectorization. We conclude that most\nof the formulations of the problem, except maybe in some trivial cases, are\nNP-hard. Finally, we propose a Local Redesigning Method (LRM), a heuristic\nalgorithm that rebalances a given sectorization by adjusting the boundaries of\nthe sectors.

Our model is robust under noise and outliers, it does not\nmake any assumptions on the sampling rates on either trajectory, and it works\neven if they are partially observed. Additionally, the model also yields a\nscalar similarity score which can be used to rank multiple pairs of\ntrajectories according to similarity, e.g. in clustering applications.

    "summary": "Let $P$ be an orthogonal polygon. Consider a sliding camera that travels back\nand forth along an orthogonal line segment $s\\in P$ as its \\emph{trajectory}.\nThe camera can see a point $p\\in P$ if there exists a point $q\\in s$ such that\n$pq$ is a line segment normal to $s$ that is completely inside $P$. In the\n\\emph{minimum-cardinality sliding cameras problem}, the objective is to find a\nset $S$ of sliding cameras of minimum cardinality to guard $P$ (i.e., every\npoint in $P$ can be seen by some sliding camera) while in the\n\\emph{minimum-length sliding cameras problem} the goal is to find such a set\n$S$ so as to minimize the total length of trajectories along which the cameras\nin $S$ travel.\n  In this paper, we first settle the complexity of the minimum-length sliding\ncameras problem by showing that it is polynomial tractable even for orthogonal\npolygons with holes, answering a question asked by Katz and Morgenstern (2011).\nWe next show that the minimum-cardinality sliding cameras problem is\n\\textsc{NP}-hard when $P$ is allowed to have holes, which partially answers\nanother question asked by Katz and Morgenstern (2011)."

    "summary": "Ruled surface is widely used in engineering design such as parting surface\ndesign of injection mold and checking surface design of checking fixture, which\nare usually generated by offsetting 3D curves. However, in 3D curve offset,\nthere often exist break,interaction and overlapping problems which can't be\nsolved by current CAD software automatically. This paper is targeted at\ndeveloping a 3D curve offsetting algorithm for ruled surface generation, and\nthree key technologies are introduced in details: An improved curve division\nmethod is proposed to reduce the offset accuracy error resulted from different\noffset distances and curvatures; An offsetting curve overlapping detection and\nelimination method is proposed; And then, a curve transition method is\npresented to improve curve offsetting quality for the break and\nintersection/overlapping regions, where a new algorithm for generating positive\nweights spherical rational quartic Bezier curve is proposed to bridge the\nbreaks of offset curves to create a smooth ruled surface. Finally, two\npractical design cases, parting surface and checking surface generation, show\nthat the proposed approach can enhance the efficiency and quality for ruled\nsurface generation in engineering design."

Given the trajectories of these entities, we define and model a\nstructure that captures all of such changes using the Reeb graph, a concept\nfrom topology. The trajectory grouping structure has three natural parameters\nthat allow more global views of the data in group size, group duration, and\nentity inter-distance. We prove complexity bounds on the maximum number of\nmaximal groups that can be present, and give algorithms to compute the grouping\nstructure efficiently. We also study how the trajectory grouping structure can\nbe made robust, that is, how brief interruptions of groups can be disregarded\nin the global structure, adding a notion of persistence to the structure.\nFurthermore, we showcase the results of experiments using data generated by the\nNetLogo flocking model and from the Starkey project. The Starkey data describe\nthe movement of elk, deer, and cattle. Although there is no ground truth for\nthe grouping structure in this data, the experiments show that the trajectory\ngrouping structure is plausible and has the desired effects when changing the\nessential parameters.

    "summary": "Measuring the similarity of curves is a fundamental problem arising in many\napplication fields. There has been considerable interest in several such\nmeasures, both in Euclidean space and in more general setting such as curves on\nRiemannian surfaces or curves in the plane minus a set of obstacles. However,\nso far, efficiently computable similarity measures for curves on general\nsurfaces remain elusive. This paper aims at developing a natural curve\nsimilarity measure that can be easily extended and computed for curves on\ngeneral orientable 2-manifolds. Specifically, we measure similarity between\nhomotopic curves based on how hard it is to deform one curve into the other one\ncontinuously, and define this \"hardness\" as the minimum possible surface area\nswept by a homotopy between the curves. We consider cases where curves are\nembedded in the plane or on a triangulated orientable surface with genus $g$,\nand we present efficient algorithms (which are either quadratic or near linear\ntime, depending on the setting) for both cases."

    "summary": "Most CAD or other spatial data models, in particular boundary representation\nmodels, are called \"topological\" and represent spatial data by a structured\ncollection of \"topological primitives\" like edges, vertices, faces, and\nvolumes. These then represent spatial objects in geo-information- (GIS) or CAD\nsystems or in building information models (BIM). Volume objects may then either\nbe represented by their 2D boundary or by a dedicated 3D-element, the \"solid\".\nThe latter may share common boundary elements with other solids, just as\n2D-polygon topologies in GIS share common boundary edges. Despite the frequent\nreference to \"topology\" in publications on spatial modelling the formal link\nbetween mathematical topology and these \"topological\" models is hardly\ndescribed in the literature. Such link, for example, cannot be established by\nthe often cited nine-intersections model which is too elementary for that\npurpose. Mathematically, the link between spatial data and the modelled \"real\nworld\" entities is established by a chain of \"continuous functions\" - a very\nimportant topological notion, yet often overlooked by spatial data modellers.\nThis article investigates how spatial data can actually be considered\ntopological spaces, how continuous functions between them are defined, and how\nCAD systems can make use of them. Having found examples of applications of\ncontinuity in CAD data models it turns out that of continuity has much\npractical relevance for CAD systems."

    "summary": "Let $S$ be a point set in the plane such that each of its elements is colored\neither red or blue. A matching of $S$ with rectangles is any set of\npairwise-disjoint axis-aligned rectangles such that each rectangle contains\nexactly two points of $S$. Such a matching is monochromatic if every rectangle\ncontains points of the same color, and is bichromatic if every rectangle\ncontains points of different colors. In this paper we study the following two\nproblems:\n  1. Find a maximum monochromatic matching of $S$ with rectangles.\n  2. Find a maximum bichromatic matching of $S$ with rectangles.\n  For each problem we provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that\nconstructs a matching with at least $1/4$ of the number of rectangles of an\noptimal matching. We show that the first problem is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard even if\neither the matching rectangles are restricted to axis-aligned segments or $S$\nis in general position, that is, no two points of $S$ share the same $x$ or $y$\ncoordinate. We further show that the second problem is also $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard,\neven if $S$ is in general position. These $\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results follow\nby showing that deciding the existence of a perfect matching is\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-complete in each case. The approximation results are based on a\nrelation of our problem with the problem of finding a maximum independent set\nin a family of axis-aligned rectangles. With this paper we extend previous ones\non matching one-colored points with rectangles and squares, and matching\ntwo-colored points with segments. Furthermore, using our techniques, we prove\nthat it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-complete to decide a perfect matching with rectangles\nin the case where all points have the same color, solving an open problem of\nBereg, Mutsanas, and Wolff [CGTA (2009)]."

    "summary": "Polygons are a paramount data structure in computational geometry. While the\ncomplexity of many algorithms on simple polygons or polygons with holes depends\non the size of the input polygon, the intrinsic complexity of the problems\nthese algorithms solve is often related to the reflex vertices of the polygon.\nIn this paper, we give an easy-to-describe linear-time method to replace an\ninput polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ by a polygon $\\mathcal{P}'$ such that (1)\n$\\mathcal{P}'$ contains $\\mathcal{P}$, (2) $\\mathcal{P}'$ has its reflex\nvertices at the same positions as $\\mathcal{P}$, and (3) the number of vertices\nof $\\mathcal{P}'$ is linear in the number of reflex vertices. Since the\nsolutions of numerous problems on polygons (including shortest paths, geodesic\nhulls, separating point sets, and Voronoi diagrams) are equivalent for both\n$\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{P}'$, our algorithm can be used as a preprocessing\nstep for several algorithms and makes their running time dependent on the\nnumber of reflex vertices rather than on the size of $\\mathcal{P}$."

    "summary": "Comparing two geometric graphs embedded in space is important in the field of\ntransportation network analysis. Given street maps of the same city collected\nfrom different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they\ndiffer. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based\non structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their\nlocal connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding.\nThis ignores a key property of road networks since similarity of travel over\ntwo road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding.\nLikewise, many current street map comparison algorithms focus on the spatial\nembeddings only and do not take structural properties into account, which makes\nthese algorithms insensitive to local connectivity properties and shortest path\nsimilarities. We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two\nplanar geometric graphs embedded in the plane. Our distance measure takes\nstructural as well as spatial properties into account by imposing a distance\nmeasure between two road networks based on the Hausdorff distance between the\ntwo sets of travel paths they represent. We show that this distance can be\napproximated in polynomial time and that it preserves structural and spatial\nproperties of the graphs."

    "summary": "Finding a maximum independent set (MIS) of a given fam- ily of axis-parallel\nrectangles is a basic problem in computational geom- etry and combinatorics.\nThis problem has attracted significant atten- tion since the sixties, when\nWegner conjectured that the corresponding duality gap, i.e., the maximum\npossible ratio between the maximum independent set and the minimum hitting set\n(MHS), is bounded by a universal constant. An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one\nsmallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an\n$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in\naddition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends\na classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm\nfor the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.\nFinally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is\nbetween 2 and 4. The upper bound, which implies an approximation algorithm of\nthe same factor, follows from a simple com- binatorial argument, while the\nlower bound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in\nthe general case."

    "summary": "Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a family of methods that embed a given set\nof points into a simple, usually flat, domain. The points are assumed to be\nsampled from some metric space, and the mapping attempts to preserve the\ndistances between each pair of points in the set. Distances in the target space\ncan be computed analytically in this setting. Generalized MDS is an extension\nthat allows mapping one metric space into another, that is, multidimensional\nscaling into target spaces in which distances are evaluated numerically rather\nthan analytically. Here, we propose an efficient approach for computing such\nmappings between surfaces based on their natural spectral decomposition, where\nthe surfaces are treated as sampled metric-spaces. The resulting spectral-GMDS\nprocedure enables efficient embedding by implicitly incorporating smoothness of\nthe mapping into the problem, thereby substantially reducing the complexity\ninvolved in its solution while practically overcoming its non-convex nature.\nThe method is compared to existing techniques that compute dense correspondence\nbetween shapes.

The recurrences for inverse space-filling functions are also\npresented. Both Peano and Hilbert curves and functions and their\ngeneralizations to higher dimensions are produced by these recurrences. The\ncomputations of these space-filling functions and their inverse functions are\nabsolutely convergent geometric series.\n  The space-filling functions are constructed as limits of integer recurrences\nand equivalently as non-terminating real recurrences. Scaling relations are\ngiven which enable the space-filling functions and curves and their inverses to\nextend beyond the unit area or volume and even to all of $d$-space.\n  This unification of pandimensional space-filling curves facilitates\nquantitative comparison of curves generated from different Hamiltonian paths.\nThe isotropy and performance in dimension reduction of a variety of\nspace-filling curves are analyzed.\n  For dimension reduction it is found that Hilbert curves perform somewhat\nbetter than Peano curves and their isotropic variants."

    "summary": "The existing combinatorial methods for iso-surface computation are efficient\nfor pure visualization purposes, but it is known that the resulting\niso-surfaces can have holes, and topological problems like missing or wrong\nconnectivity can appear. To avoid such problems, we introduce a\ngraph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the generation of iso-surfaces employs\nlabeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$ is the set of vertices\nof a cuboid $C\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and\n$\\mathcal{F}\\,:\\,V\\rightarrow [0,1]$. The nodes of $G$ are weighted by the\nvalues of $\\mathcal{F}$ which represents the volumetric information, e.g.\\ from\na Volume of Fluid method. Using a given iso-level $c\\in (0,1)$, we first obtain\nall iso-points, i.e.\\ points where the value $c$ is attained by the\nedge-interpolated $\\mathcal{F}$-field. The iso-surface is then built from\niso-elements which are composed of triangles and are such that their polygonal\nboundary has only iso-points as vertices. All vertices lie on the faces of a\nsingle mesh cell.\n  We give a proof that the generated iso-surface is connected up to the\nboundary of the domain and it can be decomposed into different oriented\ncomponents. Two different components may have discrete points or line segments\nin common. The graph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces\ndeveloped in this paper enables to recover local information of the iso-surface\nthat can be used e.g.\\ to compute discrete mean curvature and to solve surface\nPDEs. Concerning the computational effort, the resulting algorithm is as\nefficient as existing combinatorial methods."

    "summary": "The Frechet distance is a well-studied and very popular measure of similarity\nof two curves. Many variants and extensions have been studied since Alt and\nGodau introduced this measure to computational geometry in 1991. Their original\nalgorithm to compute the Frechet distance of two polygonal curves with n\nvertices has a runtime of O(n^2 log n). More than 20 years later, the state of\nthe art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n^2 / log n),\nbut no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions.\n  To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong\nExponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no\nO*((2-delta)^N) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any delta > 0. Under this assumption\nwe show that the Frechet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic\ntime, i.e., in time O(n^{2-delta}) for any delta > 0. This means that finding\nfaster algorithms for the Frechet distance is as hard as finding faster CNF-SAT\nalgorithms, and the existence of a strongly subquadratic algorithm can be\nconsidered unlikely.\n  Our result holds for both the continuous and the discrete Frechet distance.\nWe extend the main result in various directions. Based on the same assumption\nwe (1) show non-existence of a strongly subquadratic 1.001-approximation, (2)\npresent tight lower bounds in case the numbers of vertices of the two curves\nare imbalanced, and (3) examine realistic input assumptions (c-packed curves)."

Our\ndata structure maintains certificates that fail only when $h(v)=h(u)$ for two\nadjacent vertices $v$ and $u$ in $\\mathbb{M}$, or when two saddle vertices lie\non the same contour of $\\mathbb{M}$. A certificate failure is handled in\n$O(\\log(n))$ time. We also show how our data structure can be extended to\nhandle a set of general update operations on $\\mathbb{M}$ and how it can be\napplied to maintain topological persistence pairs of time varying functions."

In this problem, given two\npolygonal chains $A$ and $B$ of lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively, one needs to\nsimplify them simultaneously, such that each of the resulting simplified\nchains, $A'$ and $B'$, is of length at most $k$ and the discrete \\frechet\\\ndistance between $A'$ and $B'$ is at most $\\delta$, where $k$ and $\\delta$ are\ngiven parameters.\n  In this paper we study the complexity of CPS under the discrete \\frechet\\\ndistance (CPS-3F), i.e., where the quality of the simplifications is also\nmeasured by the discrete \\frechet\\ distance. Since CPS-3F was posed in 2008,\nits complexity has remained open. However, it was believed to be \\npc, since\nCPS under the Hausdorff distance (CPS-2H) was shown to be \\npc. We first prove\nthat the weighted version of CPS-3F is indeed weakly \\npc\\, even on the line,\nbased on a reduction from the set partition problem. Then, we prove that CPS-3F\nis actually polynomially solvable, by presenting an $O(m^2n^2\\min\\{m,n\\})$ time\nalgorithm for the corresponding minimization problem. In fact, we prove a\nstronger statement, implying, for example, that if weights are assigned to the\nvertices of only one of the chains, then the problem remains polynomially\nsolvable. We also study a few less rigid variants of CPS and present efficient\nsolutions for them.\n  Finally, we present some experimental results that suggest that (the\nminimization version of) CPS-3F is significantly better than previous\nalgorithms for the motivating biological application."

    "summary": "The art gallery problem enquires about the least number of guards that are\nsufficient to ensure that an art gallery, represented by a polygon $P$, is\nfully guarded. In 1998, the problems of finding the minimum number of point\nguards, vertex guards, and edge guards required to guard $P$ were shown to be\nAPX-hard by Eidenbenz, Widmayer and Stamm. In 1987, Ghosh presented\napproximation algorithms for vertex guards and edge guards that achieved a\nratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$, which was improved upto $\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\log\nOPT)$ by King and Kirkpatrick in 2011. It has been conjectured that\nconstant-factor approximation algorithms exist for these problems. We settle\nthe conjecture for the special class of polygons that are weakly visible from\nan edge and contain no holes by presenting a 6-approximation algorithm for\nfinding the minimum number of vertex guards that runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$\ntime. On the other hand, for weak visibility polygons with holes, we present a\nreduction from the Set Cover problem to show that there cannot exist a\npolynomial time algorithm for the vertex guard problem with an approximation\nratio better than $((1 - \\epsilon)/12)\\ln n$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, unless NP=P.\nWe also show that, for the special class of polygons without holes that are\northogonal as well as weakly visible from an edge, the approximation ratio can\nbe improved to 3. Finally, we consider the Point Guard problem and show that it\nis NP-hard in the case of polygons weakly visible from an edge."

Moreover, we show that no local routing algorithm can achieve a\nbetter routing ratio, thereby proving that our routing algorithm is optimal.\nThis is somewhat surprising because the spanning ratio of the\nhalf-$\\theta_6$-graph is 2, meaning that even though there always exists a path\nwhose lengths is at most twice the Euclidean distance, we cannot always find\nsuch a path when routing locally.\n  Since every triangulation can be embedded in the plane as a\nhalf-$\\theta_6$-graph using $O(\\log n)$ bits per vertex coordinate via\nSchnyder's embedding scheme (SODA 1990), our result provides a competitive\nlocal routing algorithm for every such embedded triangulation.

    "summary": "The geometric hitting set problem is one of the basic geometric combinatorial\noptimization problems: given a set $P$ of points, and a set $\\mathcal{D}$ of\ngeometric objects in the plane, the goal is to compute a small-sized subset of\n$P$ that hits all objects in $\\mathcal{D}$. In 1994, Bronniman and Goodrich\nmade an important connection of this problem to the size of fundamental\ncombinatorial structures called $\\epsilon$-nets, showing that small-sized\n$\\epsilon$-nets imply approximation algorithms with correspondingly small\napproximation ratios. Very recently, Agarwal and Pan showed that their scheme\ncan be implemented in near-linear time for disks in the plane. Altogether this\ngives $O(1)$-factor approximation algorithms in $\\tilde{O}(n)$ time for hitting\nsets for disks in the plane.\n  This constant factor depends on the sizes of $\\epsilon$-nets for disks;\nunfortunately, the current state-of-the-art bounds are large -- at least\n$24/\\epsilon$ and most likely larger than $40/\\epsilon$. Thus the approximation\nfactor of the Agarwal and Pan algorithm ends up being more than $40$. The best\nlower-bound is $2/\\epsilon$, which follows from the Pach-Woeginger construction\nfor halfspaces in two dimensions. Thus there is a large gap between the\nbest-known upper and lower bounds. Besides being of independent interest,\nfinding precise bounds is important since this immediately implies an improved\nlinear-time algorithm for the hitting-set problem.\n  The main goal of this paper is to improve the upper-bound to $13.4/\\epsilon$\nfor disks in the plane. The proof is constructive, giving a simple algorithm\nthat uses only Delaunay triangulations. We have implemented the algorithm,\nwhich is available as a public open-source module. Experimental results show\nthat the sizes of $\\epsilon$-nets for a variety of data-sets is lower, around\n$9/\\epsilon$."

They gave both a characterization of the optimal\nsolutions and an algorithm running in $O(n^3\\log n)$ time, where $n$ represents\nthe number of clients. In this paper we show that the Espejo and Ch\\'ia's\nalgorithm does not always work correctly. At the same time, we provide a proper\ncharacterization of the solutions with a simpler proof and give an algorithm\nsolving the problem in $O(n^3)$ time."

Here the problem is extended to 3D polyhedra, with the\nguards now boundary segments who rotate half-planes of illumination. After\ncarefully detailing the 3D model, several results are established. The first is\na nearly direct extension of the planar one-way sweep strategy using what we\ncall exhaustive guards, a generalization that succeeds despite there being no\nwell-defined notion in 3D of planar \"clockwise rotation\". Next follow two\nresults: every polyhedron with r>0 reflex edges can be searched by at most r^2\nsuitably placed guards, whereas just r guards suffice if the polyhedron is\northogonal. (Minimizing the number of guards to search a given polyhedron is\neasily seen to be NP-hard.) Finally we show that deciding whether a given set\nof guards has a successful search schedule is strongly NP-hard, and that\ndeciding if a given target area is searchable at all is strongly PSPACE-hard,\neven for orthogonal polyhedra. A number of peripheral results are proved en\nroute to these central theorems, and several open problems remain for future\nwork."

Thus, the method also gives a new\nalgorithm to compute the topology for space algebraic curves.

A witness separates $p$ from $conv(S)$ and approximate $d(p, conv(S))$ to\nwithin a factor of two.

Chromatic clustering seeks to\npartition a set of colored points into groups (or clusters) so that no group\ncontains points with the same color and a certain objective function is\noptimized. In this paper, we consider two variants of the problem, chromatic\n$k$-means clustering (denoted as $k$-CMeans) and chromatic $k$-medians\nclustering (denoted as $k$-CMedians), and investigate their hardness and\napproximation solutions. For $k$-CMeans, we show that the additional coloring\nconstraint destroys several key properties (such as the locality property) used\nin existing $k$-means techniques (for ordinary points), and significantly\ncomplicates the problem. There is no FPTAS for the chromatic clustering\nproblem, even if $k=2$. To overcome the additional difficulty, we develop a\nstandalone result, called {\\em Simplex Lemma}, which enables us to efficiently\napproximate the mean point of an unknown point set through a fixed dimensional\nsimplex. A nice feature of the simplex is its independence with the\ndimensionality of the original space, and thus can be used for problems in very\nhigh dimensional space. With the simplex lemma, together with several random\nsampling techniques, we show that a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation of $k$-CMeans\ncan be achieved in near linear time through a sphere peeling algorithm.

    "summary": "Projective clustering is a problem with both theoretical and practical\nimportance and has received a great deal of attentions in recent years. Given a\nset of points $P$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space, projective clustering is to find a\nset $\\mathbb{F}$ of $k$ lower dimensional $j$-flats so that the average\ndistance (or squared distance) from points in $P$ to their closest flats is\nminimized. Existing approaches for this problem are mainly based on\nadaptive/volume sampling or core-sets techniques which suffer from several\nlimitations. In this paper, we present the first uniform random sampling based\napproach for this challenging problem and achieve linear time solutions for\nthree cases, general projective clustering, regular projective clustering, and\n$L_{\\tau}$ sense projective clustering. For the general projective clustering\nproblem, we show that for any given small numbers $0<\\gamma, \\epsilon <1$, our\napproach first removes $\\gamma|P|$ points as outliers and then determines $k$\n$j$-flats to cluster the remaining points into $k$ clusters with an objective\nvalue no more than $(1+\\epsilon)$ times of the optimal for all points. For\nregular projective clustering, we demonstrate that when the input points\nsatisfy some reasonable assumption on its input, our approach for the general\ncase can be extended to yield a PTAS for all points. For $L_{\\tau}$ sense\nprojective clustering, we show that our techniques for both the general and\nregular cases can be naturally extended to the $L_{\\tau}$ sense projective\nclustering problem for any $1 \\le \\tau < \\infty$. Our results are based on\nseveral novel techniques, such as slab partition, $\\Delta$-rotation, symmetric\nsampling, and recursive projection, and can be easily implemented for\napplications."

    "summary": "A novel 2-D method for computing the convex hull of a sufficiently dense set\nof n integer points is introduced. The approach employs a ranking function that\navoids sorting the points directly thus reducing the overall time complexity.\nThe ranked points create a simple polygonal chain from which the Convex Hull\ncan be found using a suitable O(n) method. The result is achieved by placing a\nbound on the density (or ratio) of points to m, where m is the maximum value of\nthe ranking function required to represent the set of points yielding an O(n+m)\nmethod. A fast method is then developed based on the bit length, p, of the data\nset which reduces this time further. The required conditions are easily\nsatisfied by image processing methods which determine the Hulls of polygonal\nregions where the densities are in the range of 3%. Our experiments on a range\nproblem domains show that this is not atypical. Since the complexity of the\nmethod is related to the bit size p for current machines (p=32, p=64) the\nmethod is for all practical purposes O(n). A short proof is provided."

There are faster algorithms known\nfor several special cases: Cube-KMP (where all boxes are cubes), Unitcube-KMP\n(where all boxes are cubes of equal side length), Hypervolume (where all boxes\nshare a vertex), and k-Grounded (where the projection onto the first k\ndimensions is a Hypervolume instance).\n  In this paper we bring some order to these special cases by providing\nreductions among them. In addition to the trivial inclusions, we establish\nHypervolume as the easiest of these special cases, and show that the runtimes\nof Unitcube-KMP and Cube-KMP are polynomially related. More importantly, we\nshow that any algorithm for one of the special cases with runtime T(n,d)\nimplies an algorithm for the general case with runtime T(n,2d), yielding the\nfirst non-trivial relation between KMP and its special cases. This allows to\ntransfer W[1]-hardness of KMP to all special cases, proving that no n^{o(d)}\nalgorithm exists for any of the special cases under reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions. Furthermore, assuming that there is no improved\nalgorithm for the general case of KMP (no algorithm with runtime O(n^{d/2 -\neps})) this reduction shows that there is no algorithm with runtime\nO(n^{floor(d/2)/2 - eps}) for any of the special cases.

This paper first studies what this heurstics really\nrepresents in terms of reduction of points and demonstrates that the optimum\nselection is reached using an octogon as the remaining number of points is in\nO(sqrt(N)) rather than the usual O(N). Then it focuses on optimising the\noverall computational efficiency in a convex hull computation. Although the\nheuristics is usually used as a first step in computations one can obtain the\nconvex hull directly from the heuristics's basis. First a simple incremental\nimplementation is described, and if the number of characteristic points of the\nAkl-Toussaint heuristics p is taken as a parametre the convex hull is then\ncomputed in a O(N(p+h/p)) average complexity or O(Nh) asymptotic complexity.\nGiven the relative constant factor of 1/p however experimental results show\nthat this algorithm should be considered linear in average. Worst-case\ncomplexity is in O(N^2) and space complexity is O(h) but could be O(1) if the\nrequired output is the array of convex vertices's indexes. Then a remark on why\nthe basic incremental method should be preferred for average cases is made.\nFinally an optimal linear algorithm both in average and worst-case and using a\nminimal space complexity in O(sqrt(N)) in average (or O(1) if in-place\ncomputation is allowed) is presented."

    "summary": "Let $s$ be a source point and $t$ be a destination point inside an $n$-vertex\nsimple polygon $P$. Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between $s$\nand $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple\nand piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A\ndiffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of\nturning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The\nminimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once. For computing a minimum constrained diffuse reflection path from\n$s$ to $t$, we present an $O(n(n+\\beta))$ time algorithm, where $\\beta =\\Theta\n(n^2)$ in the worst case. Here, $\\beta$ depends on the shape of the polygon. We\nalso establish some properties relating minimum constrained diffuse reflection\npaths and minimum diffuse reflection paths. Constrained diffuse reflection\npaths introduced in this paper provide new geometric insights into the hitherto\nunknown structures and shapes of optimal reflection paths."

We consider the problem of computing a Steiner tree whose Steiner\nvertices belong to $S$, in which each point of $P$ is a leaf, and whose longest\nedge length is minimum.

The task\nis to connect the sites to the labels by non-intersecting rectilinear paths,\nso-called leaders, with at most one bend.\n  In this paper, we study the Multi-Sided Boundary Labeling problem, with\nlabels lying on at least two sides of the enclosing rectangle. We present a\npolynomial-time algorithm that computes a crossing-free leader layout if one\nexists. So far, such an algorithm has only been known for the cases in which\nlabels lie on one side or on two opposite sides of $R$ (here a crossing-free\nsolution always exists). The case where labels may lie on adjacent sides is\nmore difficult. We present efficient algorithms for testing the existence of a\ncrossing-free leader layout that labels all sites and also for maximizing the\nnumber of labeled sites in a crossing-free leader layout.

Real-life\nsoftware optimisation however lies in optimising at the same time speed and\nmemory usage as well as keeping code simple. This paper first presents some\nthoughts on the available algorithms in terms of memory usage leading to a very\nsimple scan-line-based algorithm aiming at answering that challenge. Although\nsub-optimal in terms of speed it is optimal if both speed and memory space are\ntaken together and is very easy to implement. For N segments and k\nintersections it uses only N additional integers and lists the intersections in\nO(N^1.26) or corrects them in O((N+k) N^0.26) at most in average, with a high\nprobability of a much lower exponent around 0.16 and even as low as 0.1. It is\ntherefore well adapted for inclusion in larger software and seems like a good\ncompromise. Worst-case is in O(N^2). Then the paper will focus on differences\nbetween available methods and the brute-force algorithm and a solution is\nproposed. Although sub-optimal its applications could mainly be to answer in a\nfast way a number of scattered unrelated intersection queries using minimal\ncomplexity and additional resources."

Our framework is\nadapted to the well-established industry-standard brep format to enable its\nimplementation in modern CAD systems. This is achieved via a \"local analysis\",\nwhich covers parametrization and singularities, as well as a \"global theory\"\nwhich tackles face-boundaries, self-intersections and trim curves. Central to\nthe local analysis is the \"funnel\" which serves as a natural parameter space\nfor the basic surfaces constituting the sweep. The trimming problem is reduced\nto the problem of surface-surface intersections of these basic surfaces. Based\non the complexity of these intersections, we introduce a novel classification\nof sweeps as either decomposable or non-decomposable. Further, we construct an\n{\\em invariant} function $\\theta$ on the funnel which efficiently separates\ndecomposable and non-decomposable sweeps. Through a geometric theorem we also\nshow intimate connections between $\\theta$, local curvatures and the inverse\ntrajectory used in earlier works as an approach towards trimming. In contrast\nto the inverse trajectory approach, $\\theta$ is robust and is the key to a\ncomplete structural understanding, and an efficient computation of both, the\nsingular locus and the trim curves, which are central to a stable\nimplementation. Several illustrative outputs of a pilot implementation are\nincluded."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of reporting convex hull points in an orthogonal\nrange query in two dimensions. Formally, let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. A point lies on the convex hull of a point set $S$ if it lies\non the boundary of the minimum convex polygon formed by $S$. In this paper, we\nare interested in finding the points that lie on the boundary of the convex\nhull of the points in $P$ that also fall with in an orthogonal\nrange$[x_{lt},x_{rt}]\\times{}[y_b, y_t]$. We propose a $O(n \\log^{2} n) $ space\ndata structure that can support reporting points on a convex hull inside an\northogonal range query, in time $O(\\log^{3} n + h)$. Here $h$ is the size of\nthe output. This work improves the result of (Brass et al. 2013) \\cite{brass}\nthat builds a data structure that uses $O(n \\log^{2} n)$ space and has a\n$O(\\log^{5} n + h)$ query time. Additionally, we show that our data structure\ncan be modified slightly to solve other related problems. For instance, for\ncounting the number of points on the convex hull in an orthogonal query\nrectangle, we propose an $O(n \\log^{2}n)$ space data structure that can be\nqueried upon in $O(\\log^{3} n)$ time. We also propose a $O(n \\log^{2} n) $\nspace data structure that can compute the $area$ and $perimeter$ of the convex\nhull inside an orthogonal range query in $O(\\log^{3} n$) time."

    "summary": "For a set of points in the plane and a fixed integer $k > 0$, the Yao graph\n$Y_k$ partitions the space around each point into $k$ equiangular cones of\nangle $\\theta=2\\pi/k$, and connects each point to a nearest neighbor in each\ncone. It is known for all Yao graphs, with the sole exception of $Y_5$, whether\nor not they are geometric spanners. In this paper we close this gap by showing\nthat for odd $k \\geq 5$, the spanning ratio of $Y_k$ is at most\n$1/(1-2\\sin(3\\theta/8))$, which gives the first constant upper bound for $Y_5$,\nand is an improvement over the previous bound of $1/(1-2\\sin(\\theta/2))$ for\nodd $k \\geq 7$. We further reduce the upper bound on the spanning ratio for\n$Y_5$ from $10.9$ to $2+\\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.74$, which falls slightly below the\nlower bound of $3.79$ established for the spanning ratio of $\\Theta_5$\n($\\Theta$-graphs differ from Yao graphs only in the way they select the closest\nneighbor in each cone). This is the first such separation between a Yao and\n$\\Theta$-graph with the same number of cones. We also give a lower bound of\n$2.87$ on the spanning ratio of $Y_5$. Finally, we revisit the $Y_6$ graph,\nwhich plays a particularly important role as the transition between the graphs\n($k > 6$) for which simple inductive proofs are known, and the graphs ($k \\le\n6$) whose best spanning ratios have been established by complex arguments. Here\nwe reduce the known spanning ratio of $Y_6$ from $17.6$ to $5.8$, getting\ncloser to the spanning ratio of 2 established for $\\Theta_6$."

In this paper, as an\napplication of Helly's theorem, by taking a constant size sample from $S$, we\npresent a testing algorithm for $(k,G)$-clustering, i.e., to distinguish\nbetween two cases: when $S$ is $(k,G)$-clusterable, and when it is\n$\\epsilon$-far from being $(k,G)$-clusterable. A set $S$ is $\\epsilon$-far\n$(0<\\epsilon\\leq1)$ from being $(k,G)$-clusterable if at least $\\epsilon n$\npoints need to be removed from $S$ to make it $(k,G)$-clusterable. We solve\nthis problem for $k=1$ and when $G$ is a symmetric convex object. For $k>1$, we\nsolve a weaker version of this problem. Finally, as an application of our\ntesting result, in clustering with outliers, we show that one can find the\napproximate clusters by querying a constant size sample, with high probability."

    "summary": "Flips in triangulations have received a lot of attention over the past\ndecades. However, the problem of tracking where particular edges go during the\nflipping process has not been addressed. We examine this question by attaching\nunique labels to the triangulation edges. We introduce the concept of the orbit\nof an edge $e$, which is the set of all edges reachable from $e$ via flips.\n  We establish the first upper and lower bounds on the diameter of the flip\ngraph in this setting. Specifically, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bounds\nfor edge-labelled triangulations of $n$-vertex convex polygons and\ncombinatorial triangulations, contrasting with the $\\Theta(n)$ bounds in their\nrespective unlabelled settings. The $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the\nconvex polygon setting might be of independent interest, as it generalizes\nlower bounds on certain sorting models. When simultaneous flips are allowed,\nthe upper bound for convex polygons decreases to $O(\\log^2 n)$, although we no\nlonger have a matching lower bound.\n  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated\npolygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This\nis in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is\nconnected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a\ncomplete characterization of the orbits. This allows us to decide connectivity\nof the flip graph of a spiral polygon in linear time. We also prove an upper\nbound of $O(n^2)$ on the diameter of each connected component, which is optimal\nin the worst case. We conclude with an example of a non-spiral polygon whose\nflip graph has diameter $\\Omega(n^3)$."

    "summary": "The development of laser scanning techniques has popularized the\nrepresentation of 3D shapes by triangular meshes with a large number of\nvertices. Compression techniques dedicated to such meshes have emerged, which\nexploit the idea that the connectivity of a dense mesh does not deviate much\nfrom the connectivity that can be constructed automatically from the vertex\npositions (while possibly being guided by additional codes). The edge flip is\none of the tools that can encode the differences between two meshes, and it is\nimportant to control the length of a sequence of flips that transform one\ntriangulation into another. This paper provides a practical solution to this\nproblem. Indeed, the problem of determining a minimal sequence of edge flips\nbetween two triangulations is NP-complete for some types of triangulations\nincluding manifold triangulations of surfaces, so that it is necessary to\ndevelop heuristics. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to establish a first\nsequence of flips between two meshes, and we advocate a solution based on the\nreduction of an existing sequence. The new approach we propose is founded on\nthe assignment of labels to identify the edges, with a property of label\ntransfer during a flip. This gives a meaning to the tracking of an edge in a\nsequence of flips and offers the exploitation of very simple combinatorial\nproperties. All the operations are performed directly on the sequence of labels\ndenoting the edges to be flipped, almost regardless of the underlying surface,\nsince only local temporary connectivity is involved."

The \\emph{discrete Fr\\'echet distance} is an analogous similarity\nmeasure, defined for a sequence $A$ of $m$ points and a sequence $B$ of $n$\npoints, where the points are usually sampled from input curves. In this paper\nwe consider a variant, called the \\emph{discrete Fr\\'echet distance with\nshortcuts}, which captures the similarity between (sampled) curves in the\npresence of outliers. For the \\emph{two-sided} case, where shortcuts are\nallowed in both curves, we give an $O((m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)\\log^3 (m+n))$-time\nalgorithm for computing this distance. When shortcuts are allowed only in one\nnoise-containing curve, we give an even faster randomized algorithm that runs\nin $O((m+n)^{6/5+\\varepsilon})$ expected time, for any $\\varepsilon>0$.\n  Our techniques are novel and may find further applications. One of the main\nnew technical results is: Given two sets of points $A$ and $B$ and an interval\n$I$, we develop an algorithm that decides whether the number of pairs $(x,y)\\in\nA\\times B$ whose distance ${\\rm dist}(x,y)$ is in $I$, is less than some given\nthreshold $L$. The running time of this algorithm decreases as $L$ increases.\nIn case there are more than $L$ pairs of points whose distance is in $I$, we\ncan get a small sample of pairs that contains a pair at approximate median\ndistance (i.e., we can approximately \"bisect\" $I$). We combine this procedure\nwith additional ideas to search, with a small overhead, for the optimal\none-sided Fr\\'echet distance with shortcuts, using a very fast decision\nprocedure. We also show how to apply this technique for approximating distance\nselection (with respect to rank), and for computing the semi-continuous\nFr\\'echet distance with one-sided shortcuts."

It is a much harder problem compared to\nsurface parameterization where a parametric representation is worked out only\nfor the boundary of a 3D model (which is a surface). Volumetric\nparameterization is typically helpful in solving complicated geometric problems\npertaining to shape matching, morphing, path planning of robots, and\nisogeometric analysis etc. A novel method is proposed in which a volume\nparameterization is developed by mapping a general non-convex (genus-0) domain\nto its topologically equivalent convex domain. In order to achieve a continuous\nand bijective mapping of a domain, first we use the harmonic function to\nestablish a potential field over the domain. The gradients of the potential\nvalues are used to track the streamlines which originate from the boundary and\nconverge to a single point, referred to as the shape center. Each streamline\napproaches the shape center at a unique polar angle and an azimuthal angle .\nOnce all the three parameters (potential value, polar angle, azimuthal angle)\nnecessary to represent any point in the given domain are available, the domain\nis said to be parameterized.

    "summary": "A set of points and a positive integer $m$ are given and our goal is to cover\nthe maximum number of these point with $m$ disks. We devise the first output\nsensitive algorithm for this problem. We introduce a parameter $\\rho$ as the\nmaximum number of points that one disk can cover. In this paper first we solve\nthe problem for $m=2$ in $O({n\\rho} + {\\rho ^3}\\log \\rho ))$ time. The previous\nalgorithm for this problem runs in $O({n^3}\\log n)$ time. Our algorithm\noutperforms the previous algorithm because $\\rho$ is much smaller than $n$ in\nmany cases. Then we extend the algorithm for any value of $m$ and we solve the\nproblem in $O(m{n\\rho} + {(m\\rho )^{2m - 1}}\\log m\\rho )$ time. The previous\nalgorithm for this problem runs in $O({n^{2m - 1}}\\log n)$ time. Our algorithm\nruns faster than the previous algorithm because $m\\rho$ is smaller than $n$ in\nmany cases. Our technique to obtain an output sensitive algorithm is to use a\ngreedy algorithm to confine the areas that we should search to obtain the\nresult. Our technique in this paper may be applicable in other set covering\nproblems that deploy a greedy algorithm, to obtain faster solutions."

    "summary": "Nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have demonstrated top-notch\nperformance in many pattern recognition and image classification tasks. Despite\ntheir popularity, they suffer from highly expensive time and memory\nrequirements, which render them inapplicable to large-scale datasets. To\nleverage such cases we propose a new method called \"Path-Based Isomap\". Similar\nto Isomap, we exploit geodesic paths to find the low-dimensional embedding.\nHowever, instead of preserving pairwise geodesic distances, the low-dimensional\nembedding is computed via a path-mapping algorithm. Due to the much fewer\nnumber of paths compared to number of data points, a significant improvement in\ntime and memory complexity without any decline in performance is achieved. The\nmethod demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on well-known synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, as well as in the presence of noise."

While generating Delaunay tessellations to\nbe used together with the finite volume method, it is not necessary to\npartition them into tetrahedra; co-spherical elements can be used as final\nelements. This paper presents a study of all co-spherical elements that appear\nwhile tessellating a 1-irregular cuboid (cuboid with at most one Steiner point\non its edges) with different aspect ratio. Steiner points can be located at any\nposition between the edge endpoints. When Steiner points are located at edge\nmidpoints, 24 co-spherical elements appear while tessellating 1-irregular\ncubes. By inserting internal faces and edges to these new elements, this number\nis reduced to 13. When 1-irregular cuboids with aspect ratio equal to\n$\\sqrt{2}$ are tessellated, 10 co-spherical elements are required. If\n1-irregular cuboids have aspect ratio between 1 and $\\sqrt{2}$, all the\ntessellations are adequate for the finite volume method. When Steiner points\nare located at any position, the study was done for a specific Steiner point\ndistribution on a cube. 38 co-spherical elements were required to tessellate\nall the generated 1-irregular cubes. Statistics about the impact of each new\nelement in the tessellations of 1-irregular cuboids are also included.

    "summary": "Selection lemmas are classical results in discrete geometry that have been\nwell studied and have applications in many geometric problems like weak epsilon\nnets and slimming Delaunay triangulations. Selection lemma type results\ntypically show that there exists a point that is contained in many objects that\nare induced (spanned) by an underlying point set.\n  In the first selection lemma, we consider the set of all the objects induced\n(spanned) by a point set $P$. This question has been widely explored for\nsimplices in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, with tight bounds in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In our paper,\nwe prove first selection lemma for other classes of geometric objects. We also\nconsider the strong variant of this problem where we add the constraint that\nthe piercing point comes from $P$. We prove an exact result on the strong and\nthe weak variant of the first selection lemma for axis-parallel rectangles,\nspecial subclasses of axis-parallel rectangles like quadrants and slabs, disks\n(for centrally symmetric point sets). We also show non-trivial bounds on the\nfirst selection lemma for axis-parallel boxes and hyperspheres in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n  In the second selection lemma, we consider an arbitrary $m$ sized subset of\nthe set of all objects induced by $P$. We study this problem for axis-parallel\nrectangles and show that there exists an point in the plane that is contained\nin $\\frac{m^3}{24n^4}$ rectangles. This is an improvement over the previous\nbound by Smorodinsky and Sharir when $m$ is almost quadratic."

    "summary": "We study pursuit-evasion in a polygonal environment with polygonal obstacles.\nIn this turn based game, an evader $e$ is chased by pursuers $p_1, p_2, ...,\np_{\\ell}$. The players have full information about the environment and the\nlocation of the other players. The pursuers are allowed to coordinate their\nactions. On the pursuer turn, each $p_i$ can move to any point at distance at\nmost 1 from his current location. On the evader turn, he moves similarly. The\npursuers win if some pursuer becomes co-located with the evader in finite time.\nThe evader wins if he can evade capture forever.\n  It is known that one pursuer can capture the evader in any simply-connected\npolygonal environment, and that three pursuers are always sufficient in any\npolygonal environment (possibly with polygonal obstacles). We contribute two\nnew results to this field. First, we fully characterize when an environment\nwith a single obstacles is one-pursuer-win or two-pursuer-win. Second, we give\nsufficient (but not necessary) conditions for an environment to have a winning\nstrategy for two pursuers. Such environments can be swept by a \\emph{leapfrog\nstrategy} in which the two cops alternately guard/increase the currently\ncontrolled area. The running time of this algorithm is $O(n \\cdot h \\cdot\n{diam}(P))$ where $n$ is the number of vertices, $h$ is the number of obstacles\nand ${diam}(P)$ is the diameter of $P$.\n  More concretely, for an environment with $n$ vertices, we describe an\n$O(n^2)$ algorithm that (1) determines whether the obstacles are\nwell-separated, and if so, (2) constructs the required partition for a leapfrog\nstrategy."

    "summary": "Weighted geometric set-cover problems arise naturally in several geometric\nand non-geometric settings (e.g. the breakthrough of Bansal-Pruhs (FOCS 2010)\nreduces a wide class of machine scheduling problems to weighted geometric\nset-cover). More than two decades of research has succeeded in settling the\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximability status for most geometric set-cover problems,\nexcept for four basic scenarios which are still lacking. One is that of\nweighted disks in the plane for which, after a series of papers, Varadarajan\n(STOC 2010) presented a clever \\emph{quasi-sampling} technique, which together\nwith improvements by Chan \\etal~(SODA 2012), yielded a $O(1)$-approximation\nalgorithm. Even for the unweighted case, a PTAS for a fundamental class of\nobjects called pseudodisks (which includes disks, unit-height rectangles,\ntranslates of convex sets etc.) is currently unknown. Another fundamental case\nis weighted halfspaces in $\\Re^3$, for which a PTAS is currently lacking. In\nthis paper, we present a QPTAS for all of these remaining problems. Our results\nare based on the separator framework of Adamaszek-Wiese (FOCS 2013, SODA 2014),\nwho recently obtained a QPTAS for weighted independent set of polygonal\nregions. This rules out the possibility that these problems are APX-hard,\nassuming $\\textbf{NP} \\nsubseteq \\textbf{DTIME}(2^{polylog(n)})$. Together with\nthe recent work of Chan-Grant (CGTA 2014), this settles the APX-hardness status\nfor all natural geometric set-cover problems."

This problem has applications in landmark-based mobile\nrobot navigation: Guards are landmarks, which have to be distinguishable (hence\nthe colors), and are used to encode motion primitives, \\eg, \"move towards the\nred landmark\". Let $\\chi_G(P)$, the chromatic number of $P$, denote the minimum\nnumber of colors required to color any guard cover of $P$.

A spanner\nis plane if its edges do not cross.\n  This paper considers the question: \"What is the smallest maximum degree that\ncan always be achieved for a plane spanner of E?\" Without the planarity\nconstraint, it is known that the answer is 3 which is thus the best known lower\nbound on the degree of any plane spanner. With the planarity requirement, the\nbest known upper bound on the maximum degree is 6, the last in a long sequence\nof results improving the upper bound. In this paper we show that the complete\nEuclidean graph always contains a plane spanner of maximum degree at most 4 and\nmake a big step toward closing the question.

A hyperplane $\\Hy$ is an \\emph{$m$-separator} for\n$\\D$ if each closed halfspace bounded by $\\Hy$ contains at least $m$ points\nfrom $P$. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond\nto $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied.\nSeparators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer\nschemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating\nhyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is\ndesirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls\nonly. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately\nbisect a given set of disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: Firstly, we present\na simple linear-time algorithm to construct an $\\alpha n$-separator for balls\nin $\\R^d$, for any $0<\\alpha<1/2$, that intersects at most $cn^{(d-1)/d}$\nballs, for some constant $c$ that depends on $d$ and $\\alpha$.

    "summary": "An effective strategy for accelerating the calculation of convex hulls for\npoint sets is to filter the input points by discarding interior points. In this\npaper, we present such a straightforward and efficient preprocessing approach\nby exploiting the GPU. The basic idea behind our approach is to discard the\npoints that locate inside a convex polygon formed by 16 extreme points. Due to\nthe fact that the extreme points of a point set do not alter when all points\nare rotated in the same angle, four groups of extreme points with min or max x\nor y coordinates can be found in the original point set and three rotated point\nsets. These 16 extreme points are then used to form a convex polygon. We check\nall input points and discard the points that locate inside the convex polygon.\nWe use the remaining points to calculate the expected convex hull. Experimental\nresults show that: when employing the proposed preprocessing algorithm, it\nachieves the speedups of about 4x ~5x on average and 5x ~ 6x in the best cases\nover the cases where the proposed approach is not used. In addition, more than\n99% input points can be discarded in most experimental tests."

    "summary": "Surprisingly, the order-$k$ Voronoi diagram of line segments had received no\nattention in the computational-geometry literature. It illustrates properties\nsurprisingly different from its counterpart for points; for example, a single\norder-$k$ Voronoi region may consist of $\\Omega(n)$ disjoint faces. We analyze\nthe structural properties of this diagram and show that its combinatorial\ncomplexity for $n$ non-crossing line segments is $O(k(n-k))$, despite the\ndisconnected regions. The same bound holds for $n$ intersecting line segments,\nwhen $k\\geq n/2$. We also consider the order-$k$ Voronoi diagram of line\nsegments that form a planar straight-line graph, and augment the definition of\nan order-$k$ Voronoi diagram to cover non-disjoint sites, addressing the issue\nof non-uniqueness for $k$-nearest sites. Furthermore, we enhance the iterative\napproach to construct this diagram. All bounds are valid in the general $L_p$\nmetric, $1\\leq p\\leq \\infty$. For non-crossing segments in the $L_\\infty$ and\n$L_1$ metrics, we show a tighter $O((n-k)^2)$ bound for $k>n/2$."

We let $f_k^q(P,\\rho)$ denote the minimal value and interpret\n$f_k^q(P,\\infty)$ to be $\\max_{r\\in P}d(r, \\mathcal{F})$. When $\\rho=1,2$ and\n$\\infty$ and $q=0$, the problem corresponds to the $k$-median, $k$-mean and the\n$k$-center clustering problems respectively.\n  For every $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, $S\\subset P$ and $\\rho \\ge 1$, we show that the\northogonal projection of $P$ onto a randomly chosen flat of dimension\n$O(((q+1)^2\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^3) \\log n)$ will $\\epsilon$-approximate\n$f_1^q(S,\\rho)$. This result combines the concepts of geometric coresets and\nsubspace embeddings based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.

Note that the dimension of this subspace is independent of the\nnumber of clusters~$k$.\n  Using this dimension reduction result, we obtain new approximation and\nstreaming algorithms for projective clustering problems.

Similar in spirit\nwith the Yao-Yao graphs, Theta-Theta graphs partition the space around each\nvertex into a set of k cones, for some fixed integer k > 1, and select at most\none edge per cone. The difference is in the way edges are selected. Yao-Yao\ngraphs select an edge of minimum length, whereas Theta-Theta graphs select an\nedge of minimum orthogonal projection onto the cone bisector. It has been\nestablished that the Yao-Yao graphs with parameter k = 6k' have spanning ratio\n11.67, for k' >= 6. In this paper we establish a first spanning ratio of $7.82$\nfor Theta-Theta graphs, for the same values of $k$.

We surmise that these stronger results are mainly due to a\ntighter analysis in this paper, rather than Theta-Theta being superior to\nYao-Yao as a spanner. We also show that the spanning ratio of Theta-Theta\ngraphs decreases to 4.64 as k' increases to 8. These are the first results on\nthe spanning properties of Theta-Theta graphs."

    "summary": "The Art Gallery Problem (AGP) is one of the classical problems in\ncomputational geometry. It asks for the minimum number of guards required to\nachieve visibility coverage of a given polygon. The AGP is well-known to be\nNP-hard even in restricted cases. In this paper, we consider the Art Gallery\nProblem with Fading (AGPF): A polygonal region is to be illuminated with light\nsources such that every point is illuminated with at least a global threshold,\nlight intensity decreases over distance, and we seek to minimize the total\nenergy consumption. Choosing fading exponents of zero, one, and two are\nequivalent to the AGP, laser scanner applications, and natural light,\nrespectively. We present complexity results as well as a negative solvability\nresult. Still, we propose two practical algorithms for AGPF with fixed light\npositions (e.g. vertex guards) independent of the fading exponent, which we\ndemonstrate to work well in practice. One is based on a discrete approximation,\nthe other on non-linear programming by means of simplex-partitioning\nstrategies. The former approach yields a fully polynomial-time approximation\nscheme for AGPF with fixed light positions. The latter approach obtains better\nresults in our experimental evaluation."

The contour tree is a\nfundamental topological structure that tracks the evolution of level sets of\n$f$ and has numerous applications in data analysis and visualization.\n  All existing algorithms begin with a global sort of at least all critical\nvalues of $f$, which can require (roughly) $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ time. Existing\nlower bounds show that there are pathological instances where this sort is\nrequired. We present the first algorithm whose time complexity depends on the\ncontour tree structure, and avoids the global sort for non-pathological inputs.\nIf $C$ denotes the set of critical points in $\\mathbb{M}$, the running time is\nroughly $O(\\sum_{v \\in C} \\log \\ell_v)$, where $\\ell_v$ is the depth of $v$ in\nthe contour tree. This matches all existing upper bounds, but is a significant\nimprovement when the contour tree is short and fat. Specifically, our approach\nensures that any comparison made is between nodes in the same descending path\nin the contour tree, allowing us to argue strong optimality properties of our\nalgorithm.\n  Our algorithm requires several novel ideas: partitioning $\\mathbb{M}$ in\nwell-behaved portions, a local growing procedure to iteratively build contour\ntrees, and the use of heavy path decompositions for the time complexity\nanalysis."

    "summary": "Teramoto et al. defined a new measure called the gap ratio that measures the\nuniformity of a finite point set sampled from $\\cal S$, a bounded subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. We generalize this definition of measure over all metric spaces\nby appealing to covering and packing radius. The definition of gap ratio needs\nonly a metric unlike discrepancy, a widely used uniformity measure, that\ndepends on the notion of a range space and its volume. We also show some\ninteresting connections of gap ratio to Delaunay triangulation and discrepancy\nin the Euclidean plane. The major focus of this work is on solving optimization\nrelated questions about selecting uniform point samples from metric spaces; the\nuniformity being measured using gap ratio. We consider discrete spaces like\ngraph and set of points in the Euclidean space and continuous spaces like the\nunit square and path connected spaces. We deduce lower bounds, prove hardness\nand approximation hardness results. We show that a general approximation\nalgorithm framework gives different approximation ratios for different metric\nspaces based on the lower bound we deduce. Apart from the above, we show\nexistence of coresets for sampling uniform points from the Euclidean space --\nfor both the static and the streaming case. This leads to a $\\left( 1+\\epsilon\n\\right)$-approximation algorithm for uniform sampling from the Euclidean space."

    "summary": "The SINR model for the quality of wireless connections has been the subject\nof extensive recent study. It attempts to predict whether a particular\ntransmitter is heard at a specific location, in a setting consisting of $n$\nsimultaneous transmitters and background noise. The SINR model gives rise to a\nnatural geometric object, the SINR diagram, which partitions the space into $n$\nregions where each of the transmitters can be heard and the remaining space\nwhere no transmitter can be heard.\n  Efficient point location in the SINR diagram, i.e., being able to build a\ndata structure that facilitates determining, for a query point, whether any\ntransmitter is heard there, and if so, which one, has been recently\ninvestigated in several papers. These planar data structures are constructed in\ntime at least quadratic in $n$ and support logarithmic-time approximate\nqueries. Moreover, the performance of some of the proposed structures depends\nstrongly not only on the number $n$ of transmitters and on the approximation\nparameter $\\varepsilon$, but also on some geometric parameters that cannot be\nbounded a priori as a function of $n$ or $\\varepsilon$.\n  We address the question of batched point location queries, i.e., answering\nmany queries simultaneously. Specifically, in one dimension, we can answer $n$\nqueries exactly in amortized polylogarithmic time per query, while in the plane\nwe can do it approximately.\n  We also show how to answer $n^2$ queries exactly in amortized polylogarithmic\ntime per query, assuming the queries are located on a possibly non-uniform $n\n\\times n$ grid.\n  All these results can handle arbitrary power assignments to the transmitters.\nMoreover, the amortized query time in these results depends only on $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$.\n  These results demonstrate the (so far underutilized) power of combining\nalgebraic tools with those of computational geometry and other fields."

    "summary": "The approximate nearest neighbor problem ($\\epsilon$-ANN) in high dimensional\nEuclidean space has been mainly addressed by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH),\nwhich has polynomial dependence in the dimension, sublinear query time, but\nsubquadratic space requirement. In this paper, we introduce a new definition of\n\"low-quality\" embeddings for metric spaces. It requires that, for some query\npoint $q$, there exists an approximate nearest neighbor among the pre-images of\nthe $k>1$ approximate nearest neighbors in the target space. Focusing on\nEuclidean spaces, we employ random projections in order to reduce the original\nproblem to one in a space of dimension inversely proportional to $k$.\n  The $k$ approximate nearest neighbors can be efficiently retrieved by a data\nstructure such as BBD-trees. The same approach is applied to the problem of\ncomputing an approximate near neighbor, where we obtain a data structure\nrequiring linear space, and query time in $O(d n^{\\rho})$, for $\\rho\\approx\n1-\\epsilon^2/\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. This directly implies a solution for\n$\\epsilon$-ANN, while achieving a better exponent in the query time than the\nmethod based on BBD-trees. Better bounds are obtained in the case of doubling\nsubsets of $\\ell_2$, by combining our method with $r$-nets.\n  We implement our method in C++, and present experimental results in dimension\nup to $500$ and $10^6$ points, which show that performance is better than\npredicted by the analysis. In addition, we compare our ANN approach to E2LSH,\nwhich implements LSH, and we show that the theoretical advantages of each\nmethod are reflected on their actual performance."

We call the sets $P_i$\ncolor classes, and we think of the points in $P_i$ as having color $i$. A\ncolorful choice is a set with at most one point of each color. The colorful\nCaratheodory theorem guarantees the existence of a colorful choice whose convex\nhull contains the origin. So far, the computational complexity of finding such\na colorful choice is unknown.\n  We approach this problem from two directions. First, we consider\napproximation algorithms: an $m$-colorful choice is a set that contains at most\n$m$ points from each color class. We show that for any constant $\\varepsilon >\n0$, an $\\lceil \\varepsilon(d+1)\\rceil$-colorful choice containing the origin in\nits convex hull can be found in polynomial time.

Assume a simple polygon $P$ is guarded by a finite set of point guards\nand each guard is assigned one of $t$ colors. Such a chromatic guarding is said\nto be conflict-free if each point $p\\in P$ sees at least one guard with a\nunique color among all guards visible from $p$. The goal is to establish bounds\non the function $\\chi_{cf}(n)$ of the number of colors sufficient to guarantee\nthe existence of a conflict-free chromatic guarding for any $n$-vertex polygon.\nB\\\"artschi and Suri showed $\\chi_{cf}(n)\\in O(\\log n)$ (Algorithmica, 2014) for\nsimple orthogonal polygons and the same bound applies to general simple\npolygons (B\\\"artschi et al., SoCG 2014). In this paper, we assume the\nr-visibility model instead of standard line visibility. Points $p$ and $q$ in\nan orthogonal polygon are r-visible to each other if the rectangle spanned by\nthe points is contained in $P$. For this model we show $\\chi_{cf}(n)\\in\nO(\\log\\log n)$ and $\\chi_{cf}(n)\\in \\Omega(\\log\\log n /\\log\\log\\log n)$.

    "summary": "We study the problem of assigning transmission ranges to radio stations\nplaced arbitrarily in a $d$-dimensional ($d$-D) Euclidean space in order to\nachieve a strongly connected communication network with minimum total power\nconsumption. The power required for transmitting in range $r$ is proportional\nto $r^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is typically between $1$ and $6$, depending on\nvarious environmental factors. While this problem can be solved optimally in\n$1$D, in higher dimensions it is known to be $NP$-hard for any $\\alpha \\geq 1$.\n  For the $1$D version of the problem, i.e., radio stations located on a line\nand $\\alpha \\geq 1$, we propose an optimal $O(n^2)$-time algorithm. This\nimproves the running time of the best known algorithm by a factor of $n$.\nMoreover, we show a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the minimum cost\nrange assignment in $1$D whose induced communication graph is a $t$-spanner,\nfor any $t \\geq 1$.\n  In higher dimensions, finding the optimal range assignment is $NP$-hard;\nhowever, it can be approximated within a constant factor.

However, whether the problem admits a PTAS has been an open\nquestion. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by presenting\nthe first PTAS for \\UDC. Our result implies the first PTAS for the minimum\nweight dominating set problem in unit disk graphs.

Its efficiency stems in part from a property for Minkowski sums of\npolygons with holes, which in fact holds in any dimension: Given two polygons\nwith holes, for each input polygon we can fill up the holes that are relatively\nsmall compared to the other polygon. Specifically, we can always fill up all\nthe holes of at least one polygon, transforming it into a simple polygon, and\nstill obtain exactly the same Minkowski sum. Obliterating holes in the input\nsummands speeds up the computation of Minkowski sums.\n  We introduce a robust implementation of the new algorithm, which follows the\nExact Geometric Computation paradigm and thus guarantees exact results. We also\npresent an empirical comparison of the performance of Minkowski sum\nconstruction of various input examples, where we show that the implementation\nof the new algorithm exhibits better performance than several other\nimplementations in many cases.

Almost always, a distance function\nis desired that recognizes the closeness of the points in the same cluster,\neven if the Euclidean cluster diameter is large. Therefore, it is preferred to\nassign smaller costs to the paths that stay close to the input points.\n  In this paper, we consider the most natural metric with this property, which\nwe call the nearest neighbor metric. Given a point set P and a path $\\gamma$,\nour metric charges each point of $\\gamma$ with its distance to P. The total\ncharge along $\\gamma$ determines its nearest neighbor length, which is formally\ndefined as the integral of the distance to the input points along the curve. We\ndescribe a $(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm to compute the nearest neighbor\nmetric. Both approximation algorithms work in near-linear time. The former uses\nshortest paths on a sparse graph using only the input points.

Moreover in a\nrecent paper \\cite{Baker2015}, the special case of pinned line incidence\nsystems was used to model biomaterials such as cellulose and collagen fibrils\nin cell walls. In this paper, we extend the combinatorial characterization to\ngeneral pinned subspace-incidence systems, with $H$ being a non-uniform\nhypergraph and pins in $X$ being subspaces with arbitrary dimension. As there\nare generally many data points per subspace in a dictionary learning problem,\nwhich can only be modeled with pins of dimension larger than $1$, such an\nextension enables application to a much larger class of fitted dictionary\nlearning problems."

The goal of MMUP is to find $\\Lambda$ for a given\ncomplex K. To begin with, we apply an approx. preserving graph reduction on\nMMUP to obtain a new problem namely the min-partial order problem (min-POP)(a\nstrict generalization of the min-feedback arc set problem). The reduction\ninvolves introduction of rigid edges which are edges that demand strict\ninclusion in output solution. To solve min-POP, we use the Leighton- Rao\ndivide-&-conquer paradigm that provides solutions to SDP-formulated instances\nof min-directed balanced cut with rigid edges (min-DBCRE). Our first algorithm\nfor min-DBCRE extends Agarwal et al.'s rounding procedure for digraph\nformulation of ARV-algorithm to handle rigid edges.

For example, many\ndata are drawn from hidden spaces that are graph-like, such as the cosmic web.\nA metric graph offers one of the simplest yet still meaningful ways to\nrepresent the non-linear structure hidden behind the data. In this paper, we\npropose a new distance between two finite metric graphs, called the\npersistence-distortion distance, which draws upon a topological idea. This\ntopological perspective along with the metric space viewpoint provide a new\nangle to the graph matching problem. Our persistence-distortion distance has\ntwo properties not shared by previous methods: First, it is stable against the\nperturbations of the input graph metrics. Second, it is a continuous distance\nmeasure, in the sense that it is defined on an alignment of the underlying\nspaces of input graphs, instead of merely their nodes. This makes our\npersistence-distortion distance robust against, for example, different\ndiscretizations of the same underlying graph. Despite considering the input\ngraphs as continuous spaces, that is, taking all points into account, we show\nthat we can compute the persistence-distortion distance in polynomial time.

    "summary": "The goal of Point Distance Solving Problems is to find 2D or 3D placements of\npoints knowing distances between some pairs of points. The common guideline is\nto solve them by a numerical iterative method (\\emph{e.g.} Newton-Raphson\nmethod). A sole solution is obtained whereas many exist. However the number of\nsolutions can be exponential and methods should provide solutions close to a\nsketch drawn by the user.Geometric reasoning can help to simplify the\nunderlying system of equations by changing a few equations and triangularizing\nit.This triangularization is a geometric construction of solutions, called\nconstruction plan. We aim at finding several solutions close to the sketch on a\none-dimensional path defined by a global parameter-homotopy using a\nconstruction plan. Some numerical instabilities may be encountered due to\nspecific geometric configurations. We address this problem by changing\non-the-fly the construction plan.Numerical results show that this hybrid method\nis efficient and robust."

    "summary": "The steady development of motor vehicle technology will enable cars of the\nnear future to assume an ever increasing role in the decision making and\ncontrol of the vehicle itself. In the foreseeable future, cars will have the\nability to communicate with one another in order to better coordinate their\nmotion. This motivates a number of interesting algorithmic problems. One of the\nmost challenging aspects of traffic coordination involves traffic\nintersections. In this paper we consider two formulations of a simple and\nfundamental geometric optimization problem involving coordinating the motion of\nvehicles through an intersection.\n  We are given a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit\nlength line segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or\nvertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described by a\nstart and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question is whether,\nsubject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free motion plan so that\neach vehicle travels from its start position to its goal position prior to its\ndeadline.\n  We present three results. We begin by showing that this problem is\nNP-complete with a reduction from 3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained\nversion in which cars traveling horizontally can alter their speeds while cars\ntraveling vertically cannot. We present a simple algorithm that solves this\nproblem in $O(n \\log n)$ time. Finally, we provide a solution to the discrete\nversion of the problem and prove its asymptotic optimality in terms of the\nmaximum delay of a vehicle."

    "summary": "The convex hull describes the extent or shape of a set of data and is used\nubiquitously in computational geometry. Common algorithms to construct the\nconvex hull on a finite set of n points (x,y) range from O(nlogn) time to O(n)\ntime. However, it is often the case that a heuristic procedure is applied to\nreduce the original set of n points to a set of s < n points which contains the\nhull and so accelerates the final hull finding procedure. We present an\nalgorithm to precondition data before building a 2D convex hull with integer\ncoordinates, with three distinct advantages. First, for all practical purposes,\nit is linear; second, no explicit sorting of data is required and third, the\nreduced set of s points is constructed such that it forms an ordered set that\ncan be directly pipelined into an O(n) time convex hull algorithm. Under these\ncriteria a fast (or O(n)) pre-conditioner in principle creates a fast convex\nhull (approximately O(n)) for an arbitrary set of points. The paper empirically\nevaluates and quantifies the acceleration generated by the method against the\nmost common convex hull algorithms. An extra acceleration of at least four\ntimes when compared to previous existing preconditioning methods is found from\nexperiments on a dataset."

    "summary": "The Morton- or z-curve is one example for a space filling curve: Given a\nlevel of refinement L, it maps the interval [0, 2**dL) one-to-one to a set of\nd-dimensional cubes of edge length 2**-L that form a subdivision of the unit\ncube. In contrast to the Hilbert curve that is continuous, the Morton curve\nproduces jumps. We prove that any contiguous subinterval of the curve divides\nthe unit cube into no more than two face-connected, star-shaped subdomains, for\narbitrary dimensions d > 0. In other words, there can be at most one jump in\nthe curve that creates a new subdomain. We provide an algorithm for enumerating\nhow many segments of a given length are continuous and prove a lower bound on\nthe fraction of segments of a given length that are continuous. This result\nshould eliminate concerns that the Morton curve may lead to an uncontrolled\nfragmentation of the domain."

    "summary": "Computing Delaunay triangulations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ involves evaluating the\nso-called in\\_sphere predicate that determines if a point $x$ lies inside, on\nor outside the sphere circumscribing $d+1$ points $p_0,\\ldots ,p_d$. This\npredicate reduces to evaluating the sign of a multivariate polynomial of degree\n$d+2$ in the coordinates of the points $x, \\, p_0,\\, \\ldots,\\, p_d$. Despite\nmuch progress on exact geometric computing, the fact that the degree of the\npolynomial increases with $d$ makes the evaluation of the sign of such a\npolynomial problematic except in very low dimensions. In this paper, we propose\na new approach that is based on the witness complex, a weak form of the\nDelaunay complex introduced by Carlsson and de Silva. The witness complex\n$\\mathrm{Wit} (L,W)$ is defined from two sets $L$ and $W$ in some metric space\n$X$: a finite set of points $L$ on which the complex is built, and a set $W$ of\nwitnesses that serves as an approximation of $X$. A fundamental result of de\nSilva states that $\\mathrm{Wit}(L,W)=\\mathrm{Del} (L)$ if $W=X=\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nIn this paper, we give conditions on $L$ that ensure that the witness complex\nand the Delaunay triangulation coincide when $W$ is a finite set, and we\nintroduce a new perturbation scheme to compute a perturbed set $L'$ close to\n$L$ such that $\\mathrm{Del} (L')= \\mathrm{wit} (L', W)$. Our perturbation\nalgorithm is a geometric application of the Moser-Tardos constructive proof of\nthe Lov\\'asz local lemma. The only numerical operations we use are (squared)\ndistance comparisons (i.e., predicates of degree 2). The time-complexity of the\nalgorithm is sublinear in $|W|$. Interestingly, although the algorithm does not\ncompute any measure of simplex quality, a lower bound on the thickness of the\noutput simplices can be guaranteed."

    "summary": "Minimizing the number of probes is one of the main challenges in\nreconstructing geometric objects with probing devices. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the problem of using an $\\omega$-wedge probing tool to determine\nthe exact shape and orientation of a convex polygon. An $\\omega$-wedge consists\nof two rays emanating from a point called the apex of the wedge and the two\nrays forming an angle $\\omega$. To probe with an $\\omega$-wedge, we set the\ndirection that the apex of the probe has to follow, the line $\\overrightarrow\nL$, and the initial orientation of the two rays. A valid $\\omega$-probe of a\nconvex polygon $O$ contains $O$ within the $\\omega$-wedge and its outcome\nconsists of the coordinates of the apex, the orientation of both rays and the\ncoordinates of the closest (to the apex) points of contact between $O$ and each\nof the rays.\n  We present algorithms minimizing the number of probes and prove their\noptimality. In particular, we show how to reconstruct a convex $n$-gon (with\nall internal angles of size larger than $\\omega$) using $2n-2$ $\\omega$-probes;\nif $\\omega = \\pi/2$, the reconstruction uses $2n-3$ $\\omega$-probes. We show\nthat both results are optimal. Let $N_B$ be the number of vertices of $O$ whose\ninternal angle is at most $\\omega$, (we show that $0 \\leq N_B \\leq 3$). We\ndetermine the shape and orientation of a general convex $n$-gon with $N_B=1$\n(respectively $N_B=2$, $N_B=3$) using $2n-1$ (respectively $2n+3$, $2n+5$)\n$\\omega$-probes. We prove optimality for the first case. Assuming the algorithm\nknows the value of $N_B$ in advance, the reconstruction of $O$ with $N_B=2$ or\n$N_B=3$ can be achieved with $2n+2$ probes,- which is optimal."

Our algorithm is completely\ndistributed and constructs a path which gets uniformly, progressively denser as\nit becomes longer. We analyze the algorithm mathematically and prove that the\ncurve we obtain is dense. Our method is based on the Hodge decomposition\ntheorem and uses holomorphic differentials on Riemann surfaces. The underlying\nhigh genus surface is conformally mapped to a union of flat tori and then a\nproportionally-dense space filling curve on this union is constructed. The\npullback of this curve to the original network gives us the desired curve."

    "summary": "Beacon attraction is a movement system whereby a robot (modeled as a point in\n2D) moves in a free space so as to always locally minimize its Euclidean\ndistance to an activated beacon (which is also a point). This results in the\nrobot moving directly towards the beacon when it can, and otherwise sliding\nalong the edge of an obstacle. When a robot can reach the activated beacon by\nthis method, we say that the beacon attracts the robot. A beacon routing from\n$p$ to $q$ is a sequence $b_1, b_2,$ ..., $b_{k}$ of beacons such that\nactivating the beacons in order will attract a robot from $p$ to $b_1$ to $b_2$\n... to $b_{k}$ to $q$, where $q$ is considered to be a beacon. A routing set of\nbeacons is a set $B$ of beacons such that any two points $p, q$ in the free\nspace have a beacon routing with the intermediate beacons $b_1, b_2,$ ...,\n$b_{k}$ all chosen from $B$. Here we address the question of \"how large must\nsuch a $B$ be?\" in orthogonal polygons, and show that the answer is \"sometimes\nas large as $[(n-4)/3]$, but never larger.\""

However, they only represent a small number of possible\nspherical layouts which can serve as templates for symmetric assembly. In this\npaper, we formalize the necessary and sufficient conditions for symmetric\nassembly using exactly one type of building block. All such assemblies\ncorrespond to spherical polyhedra which are edge-transitive and\nface-transitive, but not necessarily vertex-transitive. This describes a new\nclass of polyhedra outside of the well-studied Platonic, Archimedean, Catalan\nand and Johnson solids. We show that this new family, dubbed almost-regular\npolyhedra, can be pa- rameterized using only two variables and provide an\nefficient algorithm to generate an infinite series of such polyhedra.\nAdditionally, considering the almost-regular polyhedra as templates for the\nassembly of 3D spherical shell structures, we developed an efficient polynomial\ntime shell assembly approximation algorithm for an otherwise NP-hard geometric\noptimization problem."

An easy way to construct and maintain R-trees for two-dimensional\npoints, due to Kamel and Faloutsos, is to keep the points in the order in which\nthey appear along the Hilbert curve. The R-tree will then store bounding boxes\nof points along contiguous sections of the curve, and the efficiency of the\nR-tree depends on the size of the bounding boxes---smaller is better. Since\nthere are many different ways to generalize the Hilbert curve to higher\ndimensions, this raises the question which generalization results in the\nsmallest bounding boxes. Familiar methods, such as the one by Butz, can result\nin curve sections whose bounding boxes are a factor $\\Omega(2^{d/2})$ larger\nthan the volume traversed by that section of the curve. Most of the volume\nbounded by such bounding boxes would not contain any data points. In this paper\nwe present a new way of generalizing Hilbert's curve to higher dimensions,\nwhich results in much tighter bounding boxes: they have at most 4 times the\nvolume of the part of the curve covered, independent of the number of\ndimensions.

Both players can move in a\nstraight line to any point within unit distance during their turn. The pursuer\n$P$ wins by capturing the evader, meaning that their distance satisfies $d(P,\nE) \\leq 1$, while the evader wins by eluding capture forever. Both players have\na map of the environment, but they have different sensing capabilities. The\nevader $E$ always knows the location of $P$. Meanwhile, $P$ only has\nline-of-sight visibility: $P$ observes the evader's position only when the line\nsegment connecting them lies entirely within the polygon. Therefore $P$ must\nsearch for $E$ when the evader is hidden from view.\n  We provide a winning strategy for $P$ in the family of strictly sweepable\npolygons, meaning that a straight line $L$ can be moved continuously over $Q$\nso that (1) $L \\cap Q$ is always convex and (2) every point on the boundary\n$\\partial Q$ is swept exactly once. This strict sweeping requires that $L$\nmoves along $Q$ via a sequence of translations and rotations. We develop our\nmain result by first considering pursuit in the subfamilies of monotone\npolygons (where $L$ moves by translation) and scallop polygons (where $L$ moves\nby a single rotation). Our algorithm uses rook strategy during its active\npursuit phase, rather than the well-known lion strategy. The rook strategy is\ncrucial for obtaining a capture time that is linear in the area of $Q$. For\nmonotone and scallop polygons, our algorithm has a capture time of $O(n(Q) +\n\\mbox{area}(Q))$, where $n(Q)$ is the number of polygon vertices. The capture\ntime bound for strictly sweepable polygons is $O( n(Q) \\cdot \\mbox{area}(Q) )$."

    "summary": "The k-means problem consists of finding k centers in the d-dimensional\nEuclidean space that minimize the sum of the squared distances of all points in\nan input set P to their closest respective center. Awasthi et. al. recently\nshowed that there exists a constant c > 1 such that it is NP-hard to\napproximate the k-means objective within a factor of c. We establish that the\nconstant c is at least 1.0013."

    "summary": "In this thesis, we study two different graph problems.\n  The first problem revolves around geometric spanners. Here, we have a set of\npoints in the plane and we want to connect them with straight line segments,\nsuch that there is a path between each pair of points that does not make a\nlarge detour. If we achieve this, the resulting graph is called a spanner. We\nfocus our attention on $\\Theta$-graphs, which are constructed by connecting\neach point with its nearest neighbour in a fixed number of cones. Although this\nconstruction is very straight-forward, it has proven challenging to fully\ndetermine the properties of the resulting graphs. We show that if the\nconstruction uses 5 cones, the resulting graphs are still spanners. This was\nthe only number of cones for which this question remained unanswered. We also\npresent a routing strategy on the half-$\\Theta_6$-graph, a variant of the graph\nwith 6 cones. We show that our routing strategy finds a path whose length is at\nmost a constant factor from the straight-line distance between the endpoints.\nMoreover, we show that this routing strategy is optimal.\n  In the second part, we turn our attention to flips in triangulations. A flip\nis a simple operation that transforms one triangulation into another. It turns\nout that with enough flips, we can transform any triangulation into any other.\nBut how many flips is enough? We present an improved upper bound of $5.2n -\n33.6$ on the maximum flip distance between any pair of triangulations with n\nvertices. Along the way, we prove matching lower bounds on each step in the\ncurrent algorithm, including a tight bound of $(3n - 9)/5$ flips needed to make\na triangulation 4-connected. In addition, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$\nbounds on the number of flips required in several settings where the edges have\nunique labels."

The known best lower bound for triangles is the\nclassic one by Jones [Jones,1964], which exhibits that the length of the\nshortest barrier for any convex polygon is at least the half of its perimeter.\nThat is, for the unit equilateral triangle, it must be at least $3/2$. Very\nrecently, this lower bounds are improved for convex $k$-gons for any $k\\geq 4$\n[Kawamura et al. 2014], but the case of triangles still lack the bound better\nthan Jones' one. The main result of this paper is to fill this missing piece:\nWe give the lower bound of $3/2 + 5 \\cdot 10^{-13}$ for the unit-size\nequilateral triangle.

    "summary": "In a book embedding of a graph G, the vertices of G are placed in order along\na straight-line called spine of the book, and the edges of G are drawn on a set\nof half-planes, called the pages of the book, such that two edges drawn on a\npage do not cross each other. The minimum number of pages in which a graph can\nbe embedded is called the book-thickness or the page-number of the graph. It is\nknown that every planar graph has a book embedding on at most four pages. Here\nwe investigate the book-embeddings of 1-planar graphs. A graph is 1-planar if\nit can be drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. We\nprove that every 1-planar graph has a book embedding on at most 16 pages and\nevery 3-connected 1-planar graph has a book embedding on at most 12 pages. The\ndrawings can be computed in linear time from any given 1-planar embedding of\nthe graph."

    "summary": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a crucial signal processing procedure to\nidentify the underlying materials (or endmembers) and their corresponding\nproportions (or abundances) from an observed hyperspectral scene. A well-known\nblind HU criterion, advocated by Craig in early 1990's, considers the vertices\nof the minimum-volume enclosing simplex of the data cloud as good endmember\nestimates, and it has been empirically and theoretically found effective even\nin the scenario of no pure pixels. However, such kind of algorithms may suffer\nfrom heavy simplex volume computations in numerical optimization, etc. In this\nwork, without involving any simplex volume computations, by exploiting a convex\ngeometry fact that a simplest simplex of N vertices can be defined by N\nassociated hyperplanes, we propose a fast blind HU algorithm, for which each of\nthe N hyperplanes associated with the Craig's simplex of N vertices is\nconstructed from N-1 affinely independent data pixels, together with an\nendmember identifiability analysis for its performance support. Without\nresorting to numerical optimization, the devised algorithm searches for the\nN(N-1) active data pixels via simple linear algebraic computations, accounting\nfor its computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations and real data\nexperiments are provided to demonstrate its superior efficacy over some\nbenchmark Craig-criterion-based algorithms in both computational efficiency and\nestimation accuracy."

One\nof the main goals of denoising algorithms is to eliminate such noise so that\nthe curated data lie within a bounded Hausdorff distance of $K$. Deconvolution\nand thresholding, the two prevailing techniques for this problem suffer from\nthe difficulty that they burden the user with setting several parameters and/or\nchoosing an appropriate noise model while guaranteeing only asymptotic\nconvergence. Our goal is to lighten this burden as much as possible while\nensuring the theoretical guarantees in all cases. First, we show that there\nexists an algorithm requiring only a single parameter under a sampling\ncondition that is not any more restrictive than the known prevailing models.\nUnder such sampling conditions, this parameter cannot be avoided. We present a\nsimple algorithm that avoids even this parameter by paying for it with a slight\nstrengthening of the sampling condition which is not unrealistic.

Note, that the coordinates being\nignored are a function of both the query point and the point returned.\n  We present a general reduction from this problem to answering ANN queries,\nwhich is similar in spirit to LSH (locality sensitive hashing) [IM98].\nSpecifically, we give a sampling technique which achieves a bi-criterion\napproximation for this problem. If the distance to the nearest neighbor after\nignoring $k$ coordinates is $r$, the data-structure returns a point that is\nwithin a distance of $O(r)$ after ignoring $O(k)$ coordinates.

In this paper, we study the problem of finding an RVR under the\nassumption that an embedding in the plane of the input graph is fixed and we\nare looking for an RVR that reflects this embedding. We show that in this case\nthe problem can be solved in polynomial time for general embedded graphs and in\nlinear time for 1-plane graphs (i.e., embedded graphs having at most one\ncrossing per edge). The linear time algorithm uses a precise list of forbidden\nconfigurations, which extends the set known for straight-line drawings of\n1-plane graphs. These forbidden configurations can be tested for in linear\ntime, and so in linear time we can test whether a 1-plane graph has an RVR and\neither compute such a representation or report a negative witness.

Also once you have calculated all the prime numbers\nless than n digits, it is very easy to find out if a given number having less\nthan n-digits is or is not a prime. We do this by separating all the primes\nwhich are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes. It so turns out\nthat the number of planes q, required to separate all the points represented by\nprimes less than n-digit, are very few in number. Thus we obtain a very\nefficient storage and retrieval system in n-dimensional space. In addition the\nstorage and retieval repository has the property that when new primes are added\nthere is no need to start all over, we can begin where we last left off and add\nthe new primes in the repository and add new planes that separate them as and\nwhen necessary. Also we can arrange matters such that the repository can begin\nto accept larger primes which has more digits say n' where n' > n. The\nalgorithm does not make use of any property of prime numbers or of integers in\ngeneral,except for the fact that any n-digit integer can be represented as a\npoint in n-dimension space. Therefore the method can serve to be a storage and\nretrieval repository of any set of given integers, in practical cases they can\nrepresent information. Thus the algorithm can be used to devise a very\nefficient storage and retrieval system for large amounts of digital data."

We show that the lines can be cut into\n$O(n^{3/2}\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}} n)$ pieces, such that the depth relation\namong these pieces is now a proper partial order. This bound is nearly tight in\nthe worst case.\n  Previous results on this topic could only handle restricted cases of the\nproblem (such as handling only triangular cycles, by Aronov, Koltun, and Sharir\n(2005), or only cycles in grid-like patterns, by Chazelle et al. (1992)), and\nthe bounds were considerably weaker---much closer to the trivial quadratic\nbound.\n  Our proof uses a recent variant of the polynomial partitioning technique, due\nto Guth, and some simple tools from algebraic geometry. It is much more\nstraightforward than the previous \"purely combinatorial\" methods.\n  Our technique can be extended to eliminating all cycles in the depth relation\namong segments, and among constant-degree algebraic arcs. We hope that a\nsuitable extension of this technique could be used to handle the much more\ndifficult case of pairwise-disjoint triangles.\n  We also discuss several algorithms for constructing a small set of cuts so as\nto eliminate all depth-relation cycles among the lines (minimizing such a set,\nfor the case of line segments, is known to be NP-complete). The performance of\nthese algorithms improves due to our new bound, but, so far, none of them both\n(a) produce close to $n^{3/2}$ cuts, and (b) run in time close to $n^{3/2}$, in\nthe worst case.\n  Our results almost completely settle a 35-year-old open problem in\ncomputational geometry, motivated by hidden-surface removal in computer\ngraphics."

    "summary": "A pseudo-polynomial time $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm is\npresented for computing the integral and average Fr\\'{e}chet distance between\ntwo given polygonal curves $T_1$ and $T_2$. In particular, the running time is\nupper-bounded by $\\mathcal{O}( \\zeta^{4}n^4/\\varepsilon^{2})$ where $n$ is the\ncomplexity of $T_1$ and $T_2$ and $\\zeta$ is the maximal ratio of the lengths\nof any pair of segments from $T_1$ and $T_2$. The Fr\\'{e}chet distance captures\nthe minimal cost of a continuous deformation of $T_1$ into $T_2$ and vice versa\nand defines the cost of a deformation as the maximal distance between two\npoints that are related. The integral Fr\\'{e}chet distance defines the cost of\na deformation as the integral of the distances between points that are related.\nThe average Fr\\'{e}chet distance is defined as the integral Fr\\'{e}chet\ndistance divided by the lengths of $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n  Furthermore, we give relations between weighted shortest paths inside a\nsingle parameter cell $C$ and the monotone free space axis of $C$. As a result\nwe present a simple construction of weighted shortest paths inside a parameter\ncell. Additionally, such a shortest path provides an optimal solution for the\npartial Fr\\'{e}chet similarity of segments for all leash lengths. These two\naspects are related to each other and are of independent interest."

    "summary": "Random sampling is a classical tool in constrained optimization. Under\nfavorable conditions, the optimal solution subject to a small subset of\nrandomly chosen constraints violates only a small subset of the remaining\nconstraints. Here we study the following variant that we call random sampling\nwith removal: suppose that after sampling the subset, we remove a fixed number\nof constraints from the sample, according to an arbitrary rule. Is it still\ntrue that the optimal solution of the reduced sample violates only a small\nsubset of the constraints?\n  The question naturally comes up in situations where the solution subject to\nthe sampled constraints is used as an approximate solution to the original\nproblem. In this case, it makes sense to improve cost and volatility of the\nsample solution by removing some of the constraints that appear most\nrestricting. At the same time, the approximation quality (measured in terms of\nviolated constraints) should remain high.\n  We study random sampling with removal in a generalized, completely abstract\nsetting where we assign to each subset $R$ of the constraints an arbitrary set\n$V(R)$ of constraints disjoint from $R$; in applications, $V(R)$ corresponds to\nthe constraints violated by the optimal solution subject to only the\nconstraints in R. Furthermore, our results are parametrized by the dimension\n$\\delta$.\n  In this setting, we prove matching upper and lower bounds for the expected\nnumber of constraints violated by a random sample, after the removal of $k$\nelements. For a large range of values of $k$, the new upper bounds improve the\npreviously best bounds for LP-type problems, which moreover had only been known\nin special cases. We show that this bound on special LP-type problems, can be\nderived in the much more general setting of violator spaces, and with very\nelementary proofs."

Every image in our model is the restriction of\n$\\mathds{1}_{\\{p\\leq0\\}}$ to the image plane, where $\\mathds{1}$ denotes the\nindicator function and $p$ is some real bivariate polynomial. This particularly\nmeans that the boundaries in the image form a subset of an algebraic curve with\nthe implicit polynomial $p$. We show that the image parameters --i.e., the\npolynomial coefficients-- satisfy a set of linear annihilation equations with\nthe coefficients being the image moments. The inherent sensitivity of the\nmoments to noise makes the reconstruction process numerically unstable and\nnarrows the choice of the sampling kernels to polynomial reproducing kernels.\nAs a remedy to these problems, we replace conventional moments with more stable\n\\emph{generalized moments} that are adjusted to the given sampling kernel. The\nbenefits are threefold: (1) it relaxes the requirements on the sampling\nkernels, (2) produces annihilation equations that are robust at numerical\nprecision, and (3) extends the results to images with unbounded boundaries. We\nfurther reduce the sensitivity of the reconstruction process to noise by taking\ninto account the sign of the polynomial at certain points, and sequentially\nenforcing measurement consistency.

    "summary": "Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensions. The simplicial depth,\n$\\sigma_P(q)$ of a point $q$ is the number of $d$-simplices with vertices in\n$P$ that contain $q$ in their convex hulls. The simplicial depth is a notion of\ndata depth with many applications in robust statistics and computational\ngeometry. Computing the simplicial depth of a point is known to be a\nchallenging problem. The trivial solution requires $O(n^{d+1})$ time whereas it\nis generally believed that one cannot do better than $O(n^{d-1})$. In this\npaper, we consider approximation algorithms for computing the simplicial depth\nof a point. For $d=2$, we present a new data structure that can approximate the\nsimplicial depth in polylogarithmic time, using polylogarithmic query time. In\n3D, we can approximate the simplicial depth of a given point in near-linear\ntime, which is clearly optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. For higher\ndimensions, we consider two approximation algorithms with different worst-case\nscenarios. By combining these approaches, we compute a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the simplicial depth in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{d/2 + 1})$ ignoring polylogarithmic factor. All of these\nalgorithms are Monte Carlo algorithms. Furthermore, we present a simple\nstrategy to compute the simplicial depth exactly in $O(n^d \\log n)$ time, which\nprovides the first improvement over the trivial $O(n^{d+1})$ time algorithm for\n$d>4$. Finally, we show that computing the simplicial depth exactly is\n#P-complete and W[1]-hard if the dimension is part of the input."

Apollonius diagrams\narguably provide the most natural division of space for many materials and\ntechnology problems, but compared to Voronoi and power diagrams, their use has\nbeen limited, presumably by the complexity of their calculation. In this work,\nwe report explicit equations for the vertices of the Apollonius diagram in a\nd-dimensional Euclidean space.

They can also be used in algorithms with\nmulti-precision numeric types and those adhering to the exact algorithms\nparadigm.

    "summary": "Modeling folding surfaces with nonzero thickness is of practical interest for\nmechanical engineering. There are many existing approaches that account for\nmaterial thickness in folding applications. We propose a new systematic and\nbroadly applicable algorithm to transform certain flat-foldable crease patterns\ninto new crease patterns with similar folded structure but with a\nfacet-separated folded state. We provide conditions on input crease patterns\nfor the algorithm to produce a thickened crease pattern avoiding local self\nintersection, and provide bounds for the maximum thickness that the algorithm\ncan produce for a given input. We demonstrate these results in parameterized\nnumerical simulations and physical models."

We consider arrangements that are outerplanar---each\ncrossing is incident to an unbounded face---and simple---each crossing point is\nthe crossing of only two curves. We show that these arrangements can be\nrepresented by chords of a circle, by convex polygonal chains with only two\nbends, or by hyperbolic lines.

A polyline drawing of $G$ in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a drawing $\\Gamma$ of $G$, where each vertex is mapped to a\npoint and each edge is mapped to a polygonal chain. Bend and layer complexities\nare two important aesthetics of such a drawing. The bend complexity of $\\Gamma$\nis the maximum number of bends per edge in $\\Gamma$, and the layer complexity\nof $\\Gamma$ is the minimum integer $r$ such that the set of polygonal chains in\n$\\Gamma$ can be partitioned into $r$ disjoint sets, where each set corresponds\nto a planar polyline drawing. Let $G$ be a graph of thickness $t$. By\nF\\'{a}ry's theorem, if $t=1$, then $G$ can be drawn on a single layer with bend\ncomplexity $0$. A few extensions to higher thickness are known, e.g., if $t=2$\n(resp., $t>2$), then $G$ can be drawn on $t$ layers with bend complexity 2\n(resp., $3n+O(1)$). However, allowing a higher number of layers may reduce the\nbend complexity, e.g., complete graphs require $\\Theta(n)$ layers to be drawn\nusing 0 bends per edge.\n  In this paper we present an elegant extension of F\\'{a}ry's theorem to draw\ngraphs of thickness $t>2$. We first prove that thickness-$t$ graphs can be\ndrawn on $t$ layers with $2.25n+O(1)$ bends per edge. We then develop another\ntechnique to draw thickness-$t$ graphs on $t$ layers with bend complexity,\ni.e., $O(\\sqrt{2}^{t} \\cdot n^{1-(1/\\beta)})$, where $\\beta = 2^{\\lceil (t-2)/2\n\\rceil }$. Previously, the bend complexity was not known to be sublinear for\n$t>2$. Finally, we show that graphs with linear arboricity $k$ can be drawn on\n$k$ layers with bend complexity $\\frac{3(k-1)n}{(4k-2)}$."

    "summary": "We describe an algorithm for solving an important geometric problem arising\nin computer-aided manufacturing. When machining a pocket in a solid piece of\nmaterial such as steel using a rough tool in a milling machine, sharp convex\ncorners of the pocket cannot be done properly, but have to be left for finer\ntools that are more expensive to use. We want to determine a tool path that\nmaximizes the use of the rough tool. Mathematically, this boils down to the\nfollowing problem. Given a simply-connected set of points $P$ in the plane such\nthat the boundary $\\partial P$ is a curvilinear polygon consisting of $n$ line\nsegments and circular arcs of arbitrary radii, compute the maximum subset\n$Q\\subseteq P$ consisting of simply-connected sets where the boundary of each\nset is a curve with bounded convex curvature. A closed curve has bounded convex\ncurvature if, when traversed in counterclockwise direction, it turns to the\nleft with curvature at most $1$. There is no bound on the curvature where it\nturns to the right. The difference in the requirement to left- and\nright-curvature is a natural consequence of different conditions when machining\nconvex and concave areas of the pocket. We devise an algorithm to compute the\nunique maximum such set $Q$. The algorithm runs in $O(n\\log n)$ time and uses\n$O(n)$ space.\n  For the correctness of our algorithm, we prove a new generalization of the\nPestov-Ionin Theorem. This is needed to show that the output $Q$ of our\nalgorithm is indeed maximum in the sense that if $Q'$ is any subset of $P$ with\na boundary of bounded convex curvature, then $Q'\\subseteq Q$."

In\nthis model, the input resides in a randomly accessible read-only memory of\n$O(n)$ words with $O(\\log{n})$ bits each. An algorithm can read and write\n$O(s)$ additional words of workspace during its execution, and it writes its\noutput to write-only memory. In a given polygon $P$ and for a given point $q\n\\in P$, we say that a point $p$ is inside the $k$-visibility region of $q$ if\nand only if the line segment $pq$ intersects the boundary of $P$ at most $k$\ntimes.

    "summary": "Let ${\\cal P}$ be a set of $n$ points embedded in the plane, and let ${\\cal\nC}$ be the complete Euclidean graph whose point-set is ${\\cal P}$. Each edge in\n${\\cal C}$ between two points $p, q$ is realized as the line segment $[pq]$,\nand is assigned a weight equal to the Euclidean distance $|pq|$. In this paper,\nwe show how to construct in $O(n\\lg{n})$ time a plane spanner of ${\\cal C}$ of\nmaximum degree at most 4 and stretch factor at most 20. This improves a long\nsequence of results on the construction of plane spanners of ${\\cal C}$. Our\nresult matches the smallest known upper bound of 4 by Bonichon et al. on the\nmaximum degree of plane spanners of ${\\cal C}$, while significantly improving\ntheir stretch factor upper bound from 156.82 to 20. The construction of our\nspanner is based on Delaunay triangulations defined with respect to the\nequilateral-triangle distance, and uses a different approach than that used by\nBonichon et al. Our approach leads to a simple and intuitive construction of a\nwell-structured spanner, and reveals useful structural properties of the\nDelaunay triangulations defined with respect to the equilateral-triangle\ndistance.\n  The structure of the constructed spanner implies that when ${\\cal P}$ is in\nconvex position, the maximum degree of this spanner is at most 3. Combining the\nabove degree upper bound with the fact that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum\ndegree of any plane spanner of ${\\cal C}$ when the point-set ${\\cal P}$ is in\nconvex position, the results in this paper give a tight bound of 3 on the\nmaximum degree of plane spanners of ${\\cal C}$ for point-sets in convex\nposition."

This paper provides a combinatorial\ncharacterization of pinned subspace-incidence systems that are \\emph{minimally\nrigid}, i.e.\\ those systems that are guaranteed to generically yield a locally\nunique realization.\n  Pinned subspace-incidence systems have applications in the \\emph{Dictionary\nLearning (aka sparse coding)} problem, i.e.\\ the problem of obtaining a sparse\nrepresentation of a given set of data vectors by learning \\emph{dictionary\nvectors} upon which the data vectors can be written as sparse linear\ncombinations. Viewing the dictionary vectors from a geometry perspective as the\nspanning set of a subspace arrangement, the result gives a tight bound on the\nnumber of dictionary vectors for sufficiently randomly chosen data vectors, and\ngives a way of constructing a dictionary that meets the bound. For less\nstringent restrictions on data, but a natural modification of the dictionary\nlearning problem, a further dictionary learning algorithm is provided. Although\nthere are recent rigidity based approaches for low rank matrix completion, we\nare unaware of prior application of combinatorial rigidity techniques in the\nsetting of Dictionary Learning.

We consider\nlocal exploration policies that use time-of-last- visit or alternatively\nleast-frequently-visited local greedy strategies to select the next step in the\nexploration path. Both of these strategies were previously considered by Cooper\net al. (2011) for a scenario in which counters for the last visit or visit\nfrequency are attached to the edges. In this work we consider the case in which\nthe counters are associated with the nodes, which for the case of dual graphs\nof geometric spaces could be argued to be intuitively more natural and likely\nmore efficient. Surprisingly, these alternate strategies give worst-case\nsuperpolynomial/ exponential time for exploration, whereas the least-frequently\nvisited strategy for edges has a polynomially bounded exploration time, as\nshown by Cooper et al.

The novel component of the algorithm is a radially\npropagating \\emph{sweep-hull} (sequentially created from the radially sorted\nset of 2D points, giving a non-overlapping triangulation), paired with a final\ntriangle flipping step to give the Delaunay triangluation.\n  In empirical tests the algorithm runs in approximately half the time of\nq-hull for 2D Delaunay triangulation on randomly generated point sets."

    "summary": "We describe a framework for counting and enumerating various types of\ncrossing-free geometric graphs on a planar point set. The framework generalizes\nideas of Alvarez and Seidel, who used them to count triangulations in time\n$O(2^nn^2)$ where $n$ is the number of points. The main idea is to reduce the\nproblem of counting geometric graphs to counting source-sink paths in a\ndirected acyclic graph.\n  The following new results will emerge. The number of all crossing-free\ngeometric graphs can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 2.83929$.\nThe number of crossing-free convex partitions can be computed in time\n$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free perfect matchings can be computed in\ntime $O(2^nn^4)$. The number of convex subdivisions can be computed in time\n$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free spanning trees can be computed in time\n$O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 7.04313$. The number of crossing-free spanning cycles\ncan be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 5.61804$.\n  With the same bounds on the running time we can construct data structures\nwhich allow fast enumeration of the respective classes. For example, after\n$O(2^nn^4)$ time of preprocessing we can enumerate the set of all crossing-free\nperfect matchings using polynomial time per enumerated object. For\ncrossing-free perfect matchings and convex partitions we further obtain\nenumeration algorithms where the time delay for each (in particular, the first)\noutput is bounded by a polynomial in $n$.\n  All described algorithms are comparatively simple, both in terms of their\nanalysis and implementation."

    "summary": "Guarding a polygon with few guards is an old and well-studied problem in\ncomputational geometry. Here we consider the following variant: We assume that\nthe polygon is orthogonal and thin in some sense, and we consider a point $p$\nto guard a point $q$ if and only if the minimum axis-aligned rectangle spanned\nby $p$ and $q$ is inside the polygon. A simple proof shows that this problem is\nNP-hard on orthogonal polygons with holes, even if the polygon is thin. If\nthere are no holes, then a thin polygon becomes a tree polygon in the sense\nthat the so-called dual graph of the polygon is a tree. It was known that\nfinding the minimum set of $r$-guards is polynomial for tree polygons, but the\nrun-time was $\\tilde{O}(n^{17})$. We show here that with a different approach\nthe running time becomes linear, answering a question posed by Biedl et al.\n(SoCG 2011). Furthermore, the approach is much more general, allowing to\nspecify subsets of points to guard and guards to use, and it generalizes to\npolygons with $h$ holes or thickness $K$, becoming fixed-parameter tractable in\n$h+K$."

    "summary": "An ortho-polygon visibility representation of an $n$-vertex embedded graph\n$G$ (OPVR of $G$) is an embedding preserving drawing of $G$ that maps every\nvertex to a distinct orthogonal polygon and each edge to a vertical or\nhorizontal visibility between its end-vertices. The vertex complexity of an\nOPVR of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that every polygon has at most $k$ reflex\ncorners. We present polynomial time algorithms that test whether $G$ has an\nOPVR and, if so, compute one of minimum vertex complexity. We argue that the\nexistence and the vertex complexity of an OPVR of $G$ are related to its number\nof crossings per edge and to its connectivity. Namely, we prove that if $G$ is\n$1$-plane (i.e., it has at most one crossing per edge) an OPVR of $G$ always\nexists while this may not be the case if two crossings per edge are allowed.\nAlso, if $G$ is a $3$-connected $1$-plane graph, we can compute in $O(n)$ time\nan OPVR of $G$ whose vertex complexity is bounded by a constant. However, if\n$G$ is a $2$-connected $1$-plane graph, the vertex complexity of any OPVR of\n$G$ may be $\\Omega(n)$. In contrast, we describe a family of $2$-connected\n$1$-plane graphs for which an embedding that guarantees constant vertex\ncomplexity can be computed. Finally, we present the results of an experimental\nstudy on the vertex complexity of OPVRs of $1$-plane graphs."

    "summary": "In this paper, we study two classic optimization problems: minimum geometric\ndominating set and set cover. Both the problems have been studied for different\ntypes of objects for a long time. These problems become APX-hard when the\nobjects are axis-parallel rectangles, ellipses, $\\alpha$-fat objects of\nconstant description complexity, and convex polygons. On the other hand, PTAS\n(polynomial time approximation scheme) is known for them when the objects are\ndisks or unit squares. Surprisingly, PTAS was unknown even for arbitrary\nsquares. For homothetic set of convex objects, an $O(k^4)$ approximation\nalgorithm is known for dominating set problem, where $k$ is the number of\ncorners in a convex object. On the other hand, QPTAS (quasi polynomial time\napproximation scheme) is known very recently for the covering problem when the\nobjects are pseudodisks. For both problems obtaining a PTAS remains open for a\nlarge class of objects.\n  For the dominating set problems, we prove that the popular local search\nalgorithm leads to an $(1+\\varepsilon)$ approximation when objects are\nhomothetic set of convex objects (which includes arbitrary squares, $k$-regular\npolygons, translated and scaled copies of a convex set etc.) in\n$n^{O(1/\\varepsilon^2)}$ time. On the other hand, the same technique leads to a\nPTAS for geometric covering problem when the objects are convex pseudodisks\n(which includes disks, unit height rectangles, homothetic convex objects etc.).\nAs a consequence, we obtain an easy to implement approximation algorithm for\nboth problems for a large class of objects, significantly improving the best\nknown approximation guarantees."

    "summary": "An Euclidean greedy embedding of a graph is a straight-line embedding in the\nplane, such that for every pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, the vertex $s$ has a\nneighbor $v$ with smaller distance to $t$ than $s$. This drawing style is\nmotivated by greedy geometric routing in wireless sensor networks.\n  A Christmas cactus is a connected graph in which every two simple cycles have\nat most one vertex in common and in which every cutvertex is part of at most\ntwo biconnected blocks. It has been proved that Christmas cactus graphs have an\nEuclidean greedy embedding. This fact has played a crucial role in proving that\nevery 3-connected planar graph has an Euclidean greedy embedding. The proofs\nconstruct greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses of exponential size, and it\nhas been an open question whether exponential area is necessary in the worst\ncase for greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses. We prove that this is indeed\nthe case."

Each step is a unidirectional linear morph, which means that\nevery vertex moves at constant speed along a straight line, and the lines are\nparallel although the vertex speeds may differ. Thus we provide an efficient\nversion of Cairns' 1944 proof of the existence of straight-line\nplanarity-preserving morphs for triangulated graphs, which required an\nexponential number of steps."

We implement geometric variants of the Hopcroft--Karp algorithm for\nbottleneck matching (based on previous work by Efrat el al.) and of the auction\nalgorithm by Bertsekas for Wasserstein distance computation. Both\nimplementations use k-d trees to replace a linear scan with a geometric\nproximity query. Our interest in this problem stems from the desire to compute\ndistances between persistence diagrams, a problem that comes up frequently in\ntopological data analysis.

    "summary": "To produce cartographic maps, simplification is typically used to reduce\ncomplexity of the map to a legible level. With schematic maps, however, this\nsimplification is pushed far beyond the legibility threshold and is instead\nconstrained by functional need and resemblance. Moreover, stylistic geometry is\noften used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore\ndiscretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon\n$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for\nthe schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a\nsimple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and\nconnected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.\n  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance\nvia the Fr\\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that\napproximates the minimal Fr\\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane\ngraph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area\npreservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is\nspecified.\n  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance\nvia the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less\nstrict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.\nThis result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal\ntiling, and if area preservation is required. Moreover, it is independent of\nwhether we allow the set of faces to have holes or not."

The length $\\beta$\nof an arc (a fence) within the perimeter of the corresponding circle, as well\nas the promise that the treasure is outside the fence, is given as part of the\ninput. The goal is to device movement trajectories so that the robot locates\nthe treasure in minimum time. Notably, although the presence of the fence\nlimits searching uncertainty, the location of the fence is unknown, and in the\nworst case analysis is determined adversarially. Nevertheless, the robot has\nthe ability to move in the interior of the circle. In particular the robot can\nattempt a number of chord-jump moves if it happens to be within the fence or if\nan endpoint of the fence is discovered.\n  The optimal solution to our question can be obtained as a solution to a\ncomplicated optimization problem, which involves trigonometric functions, and\ntrigonometric equations that do not admit closed form solutions. For the 1-Jump\nAlgorithm, we fully describe the optimal trajectory, and provide an analysis of\nthe associated cost as a function of $\\beta$. Our analysis indicates that the\noptimal k-Jump Algorithm requires that the robot has enough memory and\ncomputation power to compute the optimal chord-jumps. Motivated by this, we\ngive an abstract performance analysis for every k-Jump Algorithm. Subsequently,\nwe present a highly efficient Halving Heuristic k-Jump Algorithm that can\neffectively approximate the optimal k-Jump Algorithm, with very limited memory\nand computation requirements."

The input\nis initially coarsened in order to automatically remove unwanted channels that\nare under a desired resolution. A valid non-overlapping 1D mesh is then created\non the sphere using the Euclidian coordinates system $x,y,z$. A modified\nDelaunay kernel is then proposed that enables to generate meshes on the sphere\nin a straightforward manner without parametrization. One of the main difficulty\nin dealing with geographical data is the over-sampled nature of coastline\nrepresentations. We propose here an algorithm that automatically unrefines\ncoastline data. Small features are automatically removed while always keeping a\nvalid (non-overlapping) geometrical representation of the domain. A Delaunay\nrefinement procedure is subsequently applied to the domain. The refinement\nscheme is also multi-threaded at a fine grain level, allowing to generate about\na million points per second on 8 threads.

We focus on two properties, namely the\nmonotonicity w.r.t. a single direction ($y$-monotonicity) and the monotonicity\nw.r.t. a single pair of orthogonal directions ($xy$-monotonicity). We propose\nalgorithms that compute the rooted $y$-monotone ($xy$-monotone) minimum\nspanning tree of $P$ in $O(|P|\\log^2 |P|)$ (resp. $O(|P|\\log^3 |P|)$) time when\nthe direction (resp. pair of orthogonal directions) of monotonicity is given,\nand in $O(|P|^2\\log|P|)$ time when the optimum direction (resp. pair of\northogonal directions) has to be determined.

In this paper, we study two important geometric\noptimization problems, the $k$-center problem and the $j$-flat-center problem,\nover stochastic/uncertain data points in Euclidean spaces. For the stochastic\n$k$-center problem, we would like to find $k$ points in a fixed dimensional\nEuclidean space, such that the expected value of the $k$-center objective is\nminimized. For the stochastic $j$-flat-center problem, we seek a $j$-flat\n(i.e., a $j$-dimensional affine subspace) such that the expected value of the\nmaximum distance from any point to the $j$-flat is minimized. We consider both\nproblems under two popular stochastic geometric models, the existential\nuncertainty model, where the existence of each point may be uncertain, and the\nlocational uncertainty model, where the location of each point may be\nuncertain. We provide the first PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for\nboth problems under the two models.

It is shown that a class of planar, triangulated convex domains\nalways have a radially monotone spanning forest, a forest that can be found by\nan essentially greedy algorithm. This algorithm can be mimicked in 3D and\napplied to polyhedra inscribed in a sphere.

    "summary": "In tolerancing analysis, geometrical or contact specifications can be\nrepresented by polytopes. Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that\nof freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most\nof the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of\nvirtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of\neach polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by\nthe complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that\nstrategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during\nthe computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap\nfacets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded\ndisplacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the\ntheory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the\npositioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements\ndefines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces\nhave to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices\nalong the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is\npossible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the\ndimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time. An\nexample illustrates the method and shows the time reduction during the\ncomputations."

The constant-size objects can be easily\nconstructed from a constant number of individual tile types using a constant\nnumber of preprocessing self-assembly steps. Our construction uses the\nwell-studied 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) of tile self-assembly, in the\nsimple model where glues interact only with identical glues, allowing glue\nstrengths that are either positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive), and\nconstant temperature (required glue strength for parts to hold together). We\nalso require that the given shape has specified glue types on its surface, and\nthat the feature size (smallest distance between nonincident edges) is bounded\nbelow by a constant. Shape replication necessarily requires a self-assembly\nmodel where parts can both attach and detach, and this construction is the\nfirst to do so using the natural model of negative/repulsive glues (also\nstudied before for other problems such as fuel-efficient computation); previous\nreplication constructions require more powerful global operations such as an\n\"enzyme\" that destroys a subset of the tile types."

    "summary": "A drawing of a graph $G$ is radial if the vertices of $G$ are placed on\nconcentric circles $C_1, \\ldots, C_k$ with common center $c$, and edges are\ndrawn radially: every edge intersects every circle centered at $c$ at most\nonce. $G$ is radial planar if it has a radial embedding, that is, a\ncrossing-free radial drawing. If the vertices of $G$ are ordered or partitioned\ninto ordered levels (as they are for leveled graphs), we require that the\nassignment of vertices to circles corresponds to the given ordering or\nleveling. A pair of edges $e$ and $f$ in a graph is independent if $e$ and $f$\ndo not share a vertex.\n  We show that a graph $G$ is radial planar if $G$ has a radial drawing in\nwhich every two independent edges cross an even number of times; the radial\nembedding has the same leveling as the radial drawing. In other words, we\nestablish the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem for radial planarity. This\ncharacterization yields a very simple algorithm for radial planarity testing."

In this paper, we\npresent algorithms and conditional lower bounds for several variants of this\nproblem. In particular, we consider (i) the Affine SLR where we add the\nconstraint that $\\sum_i \\tau_i=1$ and (ii) the Convex SLR where we further add\nthe constraint that $\\tau \\geq 0$. Furthermore, we consider (i) the batched\n(offline) setting, where the matrix $M$ and the vector $q$ are given as inputs\nin advance, and (ii) the query(online) setting, where an algorithm preprocesses\nthe matrix $M$ to quickly answer such queries. All of the aforementioned\nvariants have been well-studied and have many applications in statistics,\nmachine learning and sparse recovery.\n  We consider the approximate variants of these problems in the \"low sparsity\nregime\" where the value of the sparsity bound $k$ is low. In particular, we\nshow that the online variant of all three problems can be solved with query\ntime $\\tilde O(n^{k-1})$. This provides non-trivial improvements over the naive\nalgorithm that exhaustively searches all ${ n \\choose k}$ subsets $B$. We also\nshow that solving the offline variant of all three problems, would require an\nexponential dependence of the form $\\tilde \\Omega(n^{k/2}/e^{k})$, under a\nnatural complexity-theoretic conjecture. Improving this lower bound for the\ncase of $k=4$ would imply a nontrivial lower bound for the famous Hopcroft's\nproblem. Moreover, solving the offline variant of affine SLR in $o(n^{k-1})$\nwould imply an upper bound of $o(n^d)$ for the problem of testing whether a\ngiven set of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space is degenerate.

    "summary": "A geometric graph is a graph whose vertex set is a set of points in the plane\nand whose edge set contains straight-line segments. A matching in a graph is a\nsubset of edges of the graph with no shared vertices. A matching is called\nperfect if it matches all the vertices of the underling graph. A geometric\nmatching is a matching in a geometric graph. In this thesis, we study matching\nproblems in various geometric graphs. Among the family of geometric graphs we\nlook at complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, complete multipartite\ngraphs, Delaunay graphs, Gabriel graphs, and $\\Theta$-graphs. The classical\nmatching problem is to find a matching of maximum size in a given graph. We\nstudy this problem as well as some of its variants on geometric graphs. The\nbottleneck matching problem is to find a maximum matching that minimizes the\nlength of the longest edge. The plane matching problem is to find a maximum\nmatching so that the edges in the matching are pairwise non-crossing. A\ngeometric matching is strong with respect to a given shape $S$ if we can assign\nto each edge in the matching a scaled version of $S$ such that the shapes\nrepresenting the edges are pairwise disjoint. The strong matching problem is to\nfind a maximum strong matching with respect to a given shape. The matching\npacking problem is to pack as many edge-disjoint perfect matchings as possible\ninto a geometric graph. We study these problems and establish lower and upper\nbounds on the size of different kinds of matchings in various geometric graphs.\nWe also present algorithms for computing such matchings. Some of the presented\nbounds are tight, while the others need to be sharpened."

The new\nbasin-hopping strategy is to shrink the container size when yielding a local\nminimum pattern.

Such techniques had been successfully\nused in other settings, for example to reduce working space for several graph\nalgorithms. However, bit manipulation is not usually employed in geometric\nalgorithms because the standard model of computation (the real RAM) does not\nsupport it. For this reason, we first revisit our model of computation to have\na reasonable theoretical framework. Under this framework we show how the use of\na bit representation for the union of triangles, in combination with\nrank-select data structures, allows us to implicitly compute the union of $n$\ntriangles with roughly $O(1)$ bits per union boundary vertex. This results in\nan algorithm that uses at most as much space as the previous one, and depending\non the input, can give a reduction of up to a factor $\\Theta(\\log n)$, while\nmaintaining the running time."

    "summary": "The Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) distance is traditionally used for measuring\ndistances between metric spaces. It is defined as the minimal distortion of\nembedding one surface into the other, while the optimal correspondence can be\ndescribed as the map that minimizes this distortion. Solving such a\nminimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires pre-computation and\nstoring of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular\nway for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them\ninto the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). When\ntruncated, The basis of the LBO is known to be the optimal for representing\nfunctions with bounded gradient in a min-max sense. Methods such as\nSpectral-GMDS exploit this idea to simplify and efficiently approximate a\nminimization related to the GH distance by operating in the truncated spectral\ndomain, and obtain state of the art results for matching of nearly isometric\nshapes. However, when considering only a specific set of functions on the\nsurface, such as geodesic distances, an optimized basis could be considered as\nan even better alternative. Here, we define the geodesic distance basis, which\nis optimal for compact approximation of geodesic distances, in terms of\nFrobenius norm. We use the suggested basis to extract the Geodesic Distance\nDescriptor (GDD), which encodes the geodesic distances information as a linear\ncombination of the basis functions. We then show how these ideas can be used to\nefficiently and accurately approximate the metric spaces matching problem with\nalmost no loss of information. These observations are used to construct a very\nsimple and efficient procedure for shape correspondence. Experimental results\nshow that the GDD improves both accuracy and efficiency of state of the art\nshape matching procedures."

We show how to find, for a given\ninteger $k>0$, the smallest-area axis-parallel rectangle that covers $k$ points\nof $P$ in $O(nk^2 \\log n+ n\\log^2 n)$ time. We also consider the problem of,\ngiven a value $\\alpha>0$, covering as many points of $P$ as possible with an\naxis-parallel rectangle of area at most $\\alpha$. For this problem we give a\nrandomized $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation that works in near-linear time: in\n$O((n/\\varepsilon^4)\\log^3 n \\log (1/\\varepsilon))$ time we find an\naxis-parallel rectangle of area at most $\\alpha$ that covers at least\n$(1-\\varepsilon)\\kappa^*$ points, where $\\kappa^*$ is the maximum possible\nnumber of points that could be covered."

The module provides the\nself-contained, parallel grid manager, as well as the underlying elementary\ncurvilinear geometry module dune-curvilineargeometry. This work is motivated by\nthe need for reliable and scalable electromagnetic design of nanooptical\ndevices. Curvilinear geometries improve both the accuracy of modeling smooth\nmaterial boundaries, and the h/p-convergence rate of PDE solutions, reducing\nthe necessary computational effort. dune-curvilineargrid provides a large\nspectrum of features for scalable parallel implementations of Finite Element\nand Boundary Integral methods over curvilinear tetrahedral geometries,\nincluding symbolic polynomial mappings and operations, recursive integration,\nsparse and dense grid communication, parallel timing and memory footprint\ndiagnostics utilities. It is written in templated C++ using MPI for\nparallelization and ParMETIS for grid partitioning, and is provided as a module\nfor the DUNE interface. The dune-curvilineargrid grid manager is continuously\ndeveloped and improved, and so is this documentation.

    "summary": "The crossing number is the smallest number of pairwise edge-crossings when\ndrawing a graph into the plane. There are only very few graph classes for which\nthe exact crossing number is known or for which there at least exist constant\napproximation ratios. Furthermore, up to now, general crossing number\ncomputations have never been successfully tackled using bounded width of graph\ndecompositions, like treewidth or pathwidth.\n  In this paper, we for the first time show that crossing number is tractable\n(even in linear time) for maximal graphs of bounded pathwidth~3. The technique\nalso shows that the crossing number and the rectilinear (a.k.a. straight-line)\ncrossing number are identical for this graph class, and that we require only an\n$O(n)\\times O(n)$-grid to achieve such a drawing.\n  Our techniques can further be extended to devise a 2-approximation for\ngeneral graphs with pathwidth 3, and a $4w^3$-approximation for maximal graphs\nof pathwidth $w$. This is a constant approximation for bounded pathwidth\ngraphs."

We investigate\ntwo fundamental problems under such a stochastic setting, the closest-pair\nproblem and the nearest-neighbor search. For the former, we study the\ncomputation of the $\\ell$-threshold probability and the expectation of the\nclosest-pair distance of a realization of $S$. We propose the first algorithm\nto compute the $\\ell$-threshold probability in $O(t+n\\log n+ \\min\\{tn,n^2\\})$\ntime for any given threshold $\\ell$, which immediately results in an\n$O(t+\\min\\{tn^3,n^4\\})$-time algorithm for computing the expected closest-pair\ndistance. Based on this, we further show that one can compute a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for the expected closest-pair distance in\n$O(t+\\varepsilon^{-1}\\min\\{tn^2,n^3\\})$ time, by arguing that the expected\nclosest-pair distance can be approximated via $O(\\varepsilon^{-1}n)$ threshold\nprobability queries. For the latter, we study the $k$ most-likely\nnearest-neighbor search ($k$-LNN) via a notion called $k$ most-likely Voronoi\nDiagram ($k$-LVD). We show that the size of the $k$-LVD $\\varPsi_T^S$ of $S$ on\n$T$ is bounded by $O(kn)$ if the existence probabilities of the points in $S$\nare constant-far from 0. Furthermore, we establish an $O(kn)$ average-case\nupper bound for the size of $\\varPsi_T^S$, by regarding the existence\nprobabilities as i.i.d. random variables drawn from some fixed distribution.\nOur results imply the existence of an LVD data structure which answers $k$-LNN\nqueries in $O(\\log n+k)$ time using average-case $O(t+k^2n)$ space, and\nworst-case $O(t+kn^2)$ space if the existence probabilities are constant-far\nfrom 0.

The robot is allowed to travel in these zones but is\npenalized in a super-linear fashion for consecutive accumulative time spent\nthere.

When no risk zones exists, our problem resorts to\ncomputing minimal-length paths which is known to be computationally hard in the\nnumber of dimensions. It is well known that in two-dimensions computing\nminimal-length paths can be done efficiently.

    "summary": "The $c$-approximate Near Neighbor problem in high dimensional spaces has been\nmainly addressed by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which offers polynomial\ndependence on the dimension, query time sublinear in the size of the dataset,\nand subquadratic space requirement. For practical applications, linear space is\ntypically imperative. Most previous work in the linear space regime focuses on\nthe case that $c$ exceeds $1$ by a constant term. In a recently accepted paper,\noptimal bounds have been achieved for any $c>1$ \\cite{ALRW17}.\n  Towards practicality, we present a new and simple data structure using linear\nspace and sublinear query time for any $c>1$ including $c\\to 1^+$. Given an LSH\nfamily of functions for some metric space, we randomly project points to the\nHamming cube of dimension $\\log n$, where $n$ is the number of input points.\nThe projected space contains strings which serve as keys for buckets containing\nthe input points. The query algorithm simply projects the query point, then\nexamines points which are assigned to the same or nearby vertices on the\nHamming cube. We analyze in detail the query time for some standard LSH\nfamilies.\n  To illustrate our claim of practicality, we offer an open-source\nimplementation in {\\tt C++}, and report on several experiments in dimension up\nto 1000 and $n$ up to $10^6$. Our algorithm is one to two orders of magnitude\nfaster than brute force search. Experiments confirm the sublinear dependence on\n$n$ and the linear dependence on the dimension. We have compared against\nstate-of-the-art LSH-based library {\\tt FALCONN}: our search is somewhat\nslower, but memory usage and preprocessing time are significantly smaller."

Greedy drawings\nsupport a simple geometric routing scheme, in which any node that has to send a\npacket to a destination \"greedily\" forwards the packet to any neighbor that is\ncloser to the destination than itself, according to the Euclidean distance in\nthe drawing. In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this\nrouting scheme is guaranteed to succeed.\n  In 2004 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy\ndrawings. The $\\textit{greedy embedding conjecture}$ states that every\n$3$-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The $\\textit{convex greedy\nembedding conjecture}$ asserts that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a\nplanar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons. In\n2008 the greedy embedding conjecture was settled in the positive by Leighton\nand Moitra.\n  In this paper we prove that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a\n$\\textit{planar}$ greedy drawing. Apart from being a strengthening of Leighton\nand Moitra's result, this theorem constitutes a natural intermediate step\ntowards a proof of the convex greedy embedding conjecture."

    "summary": "In the Any-Angle Pathfinding problem, the goal is to find the shortest path\nbetween a pair of vertices on a uniform square grid, that is not constrained to\nany fixed number of possible directions over the grid. Visibility Graphs are a\nknown optimal algorithm for solving the problem with the use of pre-processing.\nHowever, Visibility Graphs are known to perform poorly in terms of running\ntime, especially on large, complex maps. In this paper, we introduce two\nimprovements over the Visibility Graph Algorithm to compute optimal paths.\nSparse Visibility Graphs (SVGs) are constructed by pruning unnecessary edges\nfrom the original Visibility Graph. Edge N-Level Sparse Visibility Graphs\n(ENLSVGs) is a hierarchical SVG built by iteratively pruning non-taut paths. We\nalso introduce Line-of-Sight Scans, a faster algorithm for building Visibility\nGraphs over a grid. SVGs run much faster than Visibility Graphs by reducing the\naverage vertex degree. ENLSVGs, a hierarchical algorithm, improves this\nfurther, especially on larger maps. On large maps, with the use of\npre-processing, these algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than existing\nalgorithms like Visibility Graphs and Theta*."

    "summary": "The usefulness of technical drawings as well as scientific illustrations such\nas medical drawings of human anatomy essentially depends on the placement of\nlabels that describe all relevant parts of the figure. In order to not spoil or\nclutter the figure with text, the labels are often placed around the figure and\nare associated by thin connecting lines to their features, respectively. This\nlabeling technique is known as external label placement.\n  In this paper we introduce a flexible and general approach for external label\nplacement assuming a contour of the figure prescribing the possible positions\nof the labels. While much research on external label placement aims for fast\nlabeling procedures for interactive systems, we focus on highest-quality\nillustrations. Based on interviews with domain experts and a semi-automatic\nanalysis of 202 handmade anatomical drawings, we identify a set of 18 layout\nquality criteria, naturally not all of equal importance. We design a new\ngeometric label placement algorithm that is based only on the most important\ncriteria. Yet, other criteria can flexibly be included in the algorithm, either\nas hard constraints not to be violated or as soft constraints whose violation\nis penalized by a general cost function. We formally prove that our approach\nyields labelings that satisfy all hard constraints and have minimum overall\ncost. Introducing several speedup techniques, we further demonstrate how to\ndeploy our approach in practice. In an experimental evaluation on real-world\nanatomical drawings we show that the resulting labelings are of high quality\nand can be produced in adequate time."

The first\ntechnique relies on the sensitivity of LLL to permutations of the input basis\n$B$, and optimization ideas over the symmetric group $S_m$ viewed as a metric\nspace. The second technique relies on partitioning the lattice into\nsublattices, performing basis reduction in the partition sublattice blocks,\nfusing the sublattices, and repeating. We also point out places where parallel\ncomputation can reduce run-times achieving almost linear speedup. The\nmultistage hybrid technique relies on the lattice diffusion and sublattice\nfusion and hill climbing algorithms."

    "summary": "For a distribution function $F$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a point $q\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, the \\emph{spherical depth} $\\SphD(q;F)$ is defined to be the\nprobability that a point $q$ is contained inside a random closed hyper-ball\nobtained from a pair of points from $F$. The spherical depth $\\SphD(q;S)$ is\nalso defined for an arbitrary data set $S\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $q\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$. This definition is based on counting all of the closed\nhyper-balls, obtained from pairs of points in $S$, that contain $q$. The\nsignificant advantage of using the spherical depth in multivariate data\nanalysis is related to its complexity of computation. Unlike most other data\ndepths, the time complexity of the spherical depth grows linearly rather than\nexponentially in the dimension $d$. The straightforward algorithm for computing\nthe spherical depth in dimension $d$ takes $O(dn^2)$. The main result of this\npaper is an optimal algorithm that we present for computing the bivariate\nspherical depth. The algorithm takes $O(n \\log n)$ time. By reducing the\nproblem of \\textit{Element Uniqueness}, we prove that computing the spherical\ndepth requires $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ time. Some geometric properties of spherical\ndepth are also investigated in this paper. These properties indicate that\n\\emph{simplicial depth} ($\\SD$) (Liu, 1990) is linearly bounded by spherical\ndepth (in particular, $\\SphD\\geq \\frac{2}{3}SD$). To illustrate this\nrelationship between the spherical depth and the simplicial depth, some\nexperimental results are provided. The obtained experimental bound ($\\SphD\\geq\n2\\SD$) indicates that, perhaps, a stronger theoretical bound can be achieved."

We also study the problem of drawing\nmaximal planar graphs with circular arcs and provide an algorithm to draw such\ngraphs using only $(5n - 11)/3$ arcs. This provides a significant improvement\nover the lower bound of $2n$ for line segments for a nontrivial graph class."

A graph is 1-planar if it has an embedding\nwhere each edge is crossed by at most another edge. The study of 1-planar\ngraphs dates back to more than fifty years ago and, recently, it has driven\nincreasing attention in the areas of graph theory, graph algorithms, graph\ndrawing, and computational geometry. This annotated bibliography aims to\nprovide a guiding reference to researchers who want to have an overview of the\nlarge body of literature about 1-planar graphs. It reviews the current\nliterature covering various research streams about 1-planarity, such as\ncharacterization and recognition, combinatorial properties, and geometric\nrepresentations. As an additional contribution, we offer a list of open\nproblems on 1-planar graphs."

Contrasting this, the best\nknown polynomial time algorithm for the problem has an approximation ratio\nof~$n^{\\varepsilon}$. Surprisingly, we can extend the algorithm to the problem\nof computing the maximum weight subset of the given set of polygons whose\nintersection graph fulfills some sparsity condition. For example, we show that\none can approximate the maximum weight subset of polygons, such that the\nintersection graph of the subset is planar or does not contain a cycle of\nlength $4$ (i.e., $K_{2,2}$). Our algorithm relies on a recursive partitioning\nscheme, whose backbone is the existence of balanced cuts with small complexity\nthat intersect polygons from the optimal solution of a small total weight.\n  For the case of large axis-parallel rectangles, we provide a polynomial time\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for the maximum weight independent set.\nSpecifically, we consider the problem where each rectangle has one edge whose\nlength is at least a constant fraction of the length of the corresponding edge\nof the bounding box of all the input elements.

Often in practice, an input graph can be considered as\nan observed snapshot of a (potentially continuous) hidden domain or process.\nSubsequent analysis, processing, and inferences are then performed on this\nobserved graph. In this paper we advocate the perspective that an observed\ngraph is often a noisy version of some discretized 1-skeleton of a hidden\ndomain, and specifically we will consider the following natural network model:\nWe assume that there is a true graph ${G^*}$ which is a certain proximity graph\nfor points sampled from a hidden domain $\\mathcal{X}$; while the observed graph\n$G$ is an Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\\xspace type perturbed version of ${G^*}$.\n  Our network model is related to, and slightly generalizes, the\nmuch-celebrated small-world network model originally proposed by Watts and\nStrogatz. However, the main question we aim to answer is orthogonal to the\nusual studies of network models (which often focuses on characterizing /\npredicting behaviors and properties of real-world networks). Specifically, we\naim to recover the metric structure of ${G^*}$ (which reflects that of the\nhidden space $\\mathcal{X}$ as we will show) from the observed graph $G$. Our\nmain result is that a simple filtering process based on the \\emph{Jaccard\nindex} can recover this metric within a multiplicative factor of $2$ under our\nnetwork model.

In this article, we describe a compression algorithm whose principle is\ncompletely different: the order of the vertices is used to compress their\ncoordinates, and then the topology of the mesh is reconstructed from the\nvertices.

    "summary": "We propose a hybrid image-space/object-space solution to the classical hidden\nsurface removal problem: Given n disjoint triangles in Real^3 and p sample\npoints (``pixels'') in the xy-plane, determine the first triangle directly\nbehind each pixel. Our algorithm constructs the sampled visibility map of the\ntriangles with respect to the pixels, which is the subset of the trapezoids in\na trapezoidal decomposition of the analytic visibility map that contain at\nleast one pixel. The sampled visibility map adapts to local changes in image\ncomplexity, and its complexity is bounded both by the number of pixels and by\nthe complexity of the analytic visibility map. Our algorithm runs in time\nO(n^{1+e} + n^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + p), where t is the output size and e is any\npositive constant. This is nearly optimal in the worst case and compares\nfavorably with the best output-sensitive algorithms for both ray casting and\nanalytic hidden surface removal. In the special case where the pixels form a\nregular grid, a sweepline variant of our algorithm runs in time O(n^{1+e} +\nn^{2/3+e}t^{2/3} + t log p), which is usually sublinear in the number of\npixels."

    "summary": "It has recently been shown that any simple (i.e. nonintersecting) polygonal\nchain in the plane can be reconfigured to lie on a straight line, and any\nsimple polygon can be reconfigured to be convex. This result cannot be extended\nto tree linkages: we show that there are trees with two simple configurations\nthat are not connected by a motion that preserves simplicity throughout the\nmotion. Indeed, we prove that an $N$-link tree can have $2^{\\Omega(N)}$\nequivalence classes of configurations."

    "summary": "The regression depth of a hyperplane with respect to a set of n points in R^d\nis the minimum number of points the hyperplane must pass through in a rotation\nto vertical. We generalize hyperplane regression depth to k-flats for any k\nbetween 0 and d-1. The k=0 case gives the classical notion of center points. We\nprove that for any k and d, deep k-flats exist, that is, for any set of n\npoints there always exists a k-flat with depth at least a constant fraction of\nn. As a consequence, we derive a linear-time (1+epsilon)-approximation\nalgorithm for the deepest flat."
