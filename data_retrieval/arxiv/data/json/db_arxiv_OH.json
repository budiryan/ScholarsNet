    "summary": "Generalizations of linear numeration systems in which the set of natural\nnumbers is recognizable by finite automata are obtained by describing an\narbitrary infinite regular language following the lexicographic ordering. For\nthese systems of numeration, we show that ultimately periodic sets are\nrecognizable. We also study the translation and the multiplication by constants\nas well as the order dependence of the recognizability.",

    "publish": "1999-11-17T17:18:42Z", 
    "summary": "In his Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking\nTruth in the Sciences, Rene Descartes sought ``clear and certain knowledge of\nall that is useful in life.'' Almost three centuries later, in ``The\nfoundations of mathematics,'' David Hilbert tried to ``recast mathematical\ndefinitions and inferences in such a way that they are unshakable.'' Hilbert's\nprogram relied explicitly on formal systems (equivalently, computational\nsystems) to provide certainty in mathematics. The concepts of computation and\nformal system were not defined in his time, but Descartes' method may be\nunderstood as seeking certainty in essentially the same way.\n  In this article, I explain formal systems as concrete artifacts, and\ninvestigate the way in which they provide a high level of certainty---arguably\nthe highest level achievable by rational discourse. The rich understanding of\nformal systems achieved by mathematical logic and computer science in this\ncentury illuminates the nature of programs, such as Descartes' and Hilbert's,\nthat seek certainty through rigorous analysis.",

    "title": "Efficient generation of rotating workforce schedules", 
    "publish": "2000-02-29T16:56:46Z", 
    "summary": "Generating high-quality schedules for a rotating workforce is a critical task\nin all settings where a certain staffing level must be guaranteed beyond the\ncapacity of single employees, such as for instance in industrial plants,\nhospitals, or airline companies. Results from ergonomics \\cite{BEST91} indicate\nthat rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and\nsocial life of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover,\nrotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also\nmeet the objectives of the employing organization. We describe our solution to\nthis problem. A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining\nhigh-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human\ncontrol. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore\nconsists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work\nblock is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a\nparticular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal\nweekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the\nchosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences\nof shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while\nfulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint\nsatisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each\nof the four steps allows to find good solutions for real-world problems in\nacceptable time. Computational results from real-world problems and from\nbenchmark examples found in the literature confirm the viability of our\napproach. The algorithms are now part of a commercial shift scheduling software\npackage.",

    "summary": "A study on future large accelerators [1] has considered a facility, which is\ndesigned, built and operated by a worldwide collaboration of equal partner\ninstitutions, and which is remote from most of these institutions. The full\nrange of operation was considered including commi-ssioning, machine\ndevelopment, maintenance, trouble shooting and repair.

The large high-energy physics ex-periments and astronomy projects,\nalready involve inter-national collaborations of distant institutions. Based on\nthis experience, the prospects for a machine operated remotely from far sites\nare encouraging. Experts from each laboratory would remain at their home\ninstitution but continue to participate in the operation of the machine after\nconstruction. Experts are required to be on site only during initial\ncommissioning and for par-ticularly difficult problems. Repairs require an\non-site non-expert maintenance crew. Most of the interventions can be made\nwithout an expert and many of the rest resolved with remote assistance. There\nappears to be no technical obstacle to controlling an accelerator from a\ndistance. The major challenge is to solve the complex management and\ncommunication problems.",

Power supply manufacturers are providing supplies compatible with the\nstandard interface. The SNS standard consists of a VME based power supply\ncontroller module (PSC) and a power supply interface unit (PSI) that mounts on\nthe power supply. Communication between the two is via a pair of multimode\nfibers. This PSI/PSC system supports one 16-bit analog reference, four 16-bit\nanalog readbacks, fifteen digital commands and sixteen digital status bits in a\nsingle fiber-isolated module. The system can send commands to the supplies and\nread data from them synchronized to an external signal at up to a 10KHz rate.\nThe PSC time stamps and stores this data in a circular buffer so historical\ndata leading up to a fault event can be analyzed.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of model--checking for Process Rewrite Systems (PRSs)\nin normal form. In a PRS in normal form every rewrite rule either only deals\nwith procedure calls and procedure termination, possibly with value return,\n(this kind of rules allows to capture Pushdown Processes), or only deals with\ndynamic activation of processes and synchronization (this kind of rules allows\nto capture Petri Nets). The model-checking problem for PRSs and action-based\nlinear temporal logic (ALTL) is undecidable. However, decidability of\nmodel--checking for PRSs and some interesting fragment of ALTL remains an open\nquestion. In this paper we state decidability results concerning generalized\nacceptance properties about infinite derivations (infinite term rewritings) in\nPRSs in normal form.

    "publish": "2004-03-04T23:08:41Z", 
    "summary": "$\\cal{A}$ point $P \\in \\Real^n$ is represented in Parallel Coordinates by a\npolygonal line $\\bar{P}$ (see \\cite{Insel99a} for a recent survey). Earlier\n\\cite{inselberg85plane}, a surface $\\sigma$ was represented as the {\\em\nenvelope} of the polygonal lines representing it's points. This is ambiguous in\nthe sense that {\\em different} surfaces can provide the {\\em same} envelopes.\nHere the ambiguity is eliminated by considering the surface $\\sigma$ as the\nenvelope of it's {\\em tangent planes} and in turn, representing each of these\nplanes by $n$-1 points \\cite{Insel99a}. This, with some future extension, can\nyield a new and unambiguous representation, $\\bar{\\sigma}$, of the surface\nconsisting of $n$-1 planar regions whose properties correspond lead to the {\\em\nrecognition} of the surfaces' properties i.e. developable, ruled etc.\n\\cite{hung92smooth}) and {\\em classification} criteria.\n  It is further shown that the image (i.e. representation) of an algebraic\nsurface of degree 2 in $\\Real^n$ is a region whose boundary is also an\nalgebraic curve of degree 2. This includes some {\\em non-convex} surfaces which\nwith the previous ambiguous representation could not be treated. An efficient\nconstruction algorithm for the representation of the quadratic surfaces (given\neither by {\\em explicit} or {\\em implicit} equation) is provided. The results\nobtained are suitable for applications, to be presented in a future paper, and\nin particular for the approximation of complex surfaces based on their {\\em\nplanar} images. An additional benefit is the elimination of the\n``over-plotting'' problem i.e. the ``bunching'' of polygonal lines which often\nobscure part of the parallel-coordinate display.",

    "summary": "${\\cal U}$ntil now the representation (i.e. plotting) of curve in Parallel\nCoordinates is constructed from the point $\\leftrightarrow$ line duality. The\nresult is a ``line-curve'' which is seen as the envelope of it's tangents.\nUsually this gives an unclear image and is at the heart of the\n``over-plotting'' problem; a barrier in the effective use of Parallel\nCoordinates. This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides\ndirectly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was\napplied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also\ncalled dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is\nshown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of\ndegree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that\nconics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on\nalgebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained\nwhich constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential\ngeneralizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their\napproximation. The ``trade-off'' price then for obtaining {\\em planar}\nrepresentation of multidimensional algebraic curves and hyper-surfaces is the\nhigher degree of the image's boundary which is also an algebraic curve in\n$\\|$-coords.",

Today, a confluence of several\ningredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user\ninterface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of\nthe human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model\nto integrate the UI experts' UE development efforts with that of SE. This in\nturn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of\neducation and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration\nand coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the\ncurrent approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and\nanalyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having\nsubstantial interactive components.

    "publish": "2004-09-19T09:56:24Z", 
    "summary": "This paper investigates two aspects of process thinking that affect the\nsuccess rate of IT projects. These two aspects are the changes in the structure\nof organizations and the epistemology of Information Systems Development.\nFirstly, the conception of business processes within the management of\norganizations increases the structural complexity of Information Systems,\nbecause existing systems have to be integrated into a coherent cross-functional\narchitecture. Secondly, process thinking leads to a particular view of\norganizations that ultimately has a negative effect on the support of\nInformation Systems. As an illustration of process thinking, the Business\nProcess Reengineering movement adheres to a technocratic management perspective\nof organizations. Particularly this conception of organization views people as\nmechanisms to realize certain organizational goals. As a result of this view\nstakeholders are confronted with the implemented systems, rather than consulted\nabout the scope and functionality of those systems. Therefore, both aspects of\nprocess thinking have a negative impact on the success of IT projects. The\nproblem of structural complexity is an area that is addressed by Enterprise\nApplication Integration, and mainly requires technical solutions. However, the\nproblems associated with the conception of organization require a different,\nmarkedly non-technical, perspective. Several directions are discussed to\novercome some limitations of process thinking, but these directions are merely\nsmall pointers. If truly effective and useful Information Systems are to be\nacquired, IT practitioners and scientists require a completely different\nmindset.",

One classic problem within ISD is the\ndichotomy between social perspectives and technical perspectives. LAP claims it\noffers a solution to this problem. This paper investigates this claim as a\nmeans to review LAP theory. To provide a structure to a critical analysis of\nDEMO - an example methodology that belongs to the LAP research community - this\npaper utilizes a paradigmatic framework. This framework is augmented by the\nopinion of several DEMO practitioners by means of an expert discussion. With\nuse of a comparative evaluation of LAP theory and DEMO theory, the implication\nof DEMO's reflection upon LAP is determined.

As a remedy of this problem, in this paper, we have proposed a\nframework for easy security incorporation in credit card based electronic\npayment system without the use of an on-line third- party processor; which\ntends to be low cost and effective for the developing countries.",

    "publish": "2007-01-29T17:09:17Z", 
    "summary": "In many industries, the importance of software components provided by\nthird-party suppliers is steadily increasing. As the suppliers seek to secure\ntheir intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no direct\naccess to the suppliers' source code, and is able to enforce the use of\nverification tools only by legal requirements. In turn, the supplier has no\nmeans to convince the customer about successful verification without revealing\nthe source code. This paper presents an approach to resolve the conflict\nbetween the IP interests of the supplier and the quality interests of the\ncustomer. We introduce a protocol in which a dedicated server (called the\n\"amanat\") is controlled by both parties: the customer controls the verification\ntask performed by the amanat, while the supplier controls the communication\nchannels of the amanat to ensure that the amanat does not leak information\nabout the source code. We argue that the protocol is both practically useful\nand mathematically sound. As the protocol is based on well-known (and\nrelatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward\nimplementation on top of existing verification tool chains. To substantiate our\nsecurity claims, we establish the correctness of the protocol by cryptographic\nreduction proofs.",

In this paper, we propose\na versatile sum-product signal model as a physical basis for shadow fading.\nSimulation results imply that the proposed model results in log-normally\ndistributed local mean power regardless of the distributions of the\ninteractions in the radio channel, and hence it is capable of explaining the\nlog-normality in a wide variety of propagation scenarios. The sum-product model\nalso includes as its special cases the conventional product model as well as\nthe recently proposed sum model, and improves upon these by: a) being\napplicable in both global and local distance scales; b) being more plausible\nfrom physical point of view; c) providing better goodness-of-fit to log-normal\ndistribution than either of these models.",

The initial dialog workflow is\nautomatically generated and the user's interaction with the system can also\nchange the decision tree and create new dialog paths with optimized cost. The\ndecision tree represents the chronological ordering of the actions (via the\nparent-child relationship) and uses an object frame to represent the\ninformation state (capturing the notion of context).

The basic building\nblocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the\nclass of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs): the first 104 CPs have a z-transfer\nfunction whose coefficients are simply {-1,0,+1}. On the other hand, the paper\nprovides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key\nproperties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of\narchitectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by\nfocusing on a specific decimation filter obtained as a result of the\noptimization algorithm.\n  Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the\nconstituent decimation filters in the multistage chain.",

We propose a mathematical\nframework in order to completely characterize the dependence of the frequency\nresponse of GCFs on the quantization of the multipliers embedded in the\nproposed filter architecture. This analysis paves the way to the design of\nmultiplier-less decimation architectures.\n  We also derive the impulse response of a sample 3rd order GCF filter used as\na reference scheme throughout the paper.",

Next the contrast of the\ntransformed image is enhanced so as to compensate for brightness loss that\nwould arise from backlight dimming. The proposed approach relies on an accurate\ndefinition of the image distortion which takes into account both the pixel\nvalue differences and a model of the human visual system and is amenable to\nhighly efficient hardware realization. Experimental results show that the\nhistogram equalization for backlight scaling method results in about 45% power\nsaving with an effective distortion rate of 5% and 65% power saving for a 20%\ndistortion rate.

The idea is to start with a memory image wherein all basic\nblocks are compressed, and decompress only the blocks that are predicted to be\nneeded in the near future.

The results of the analysis are\neasy to interpret. Estimated phase margin is readily available. Instability\nnodes and loops along with their respective oscillation frequencies are\nimmediately identified and mapped to the existing circuit nodes thus offering\nsignificant advantages compared to traditional \"black-box\" methods of stability\nanalysis (Transient Overshoot, Bode and Phase margin plots etc.). The tool for\nAC-Stability analysis is written in SKILL? and is fully integrated in DFII?\nenvironment. Its \"push-button\" graphical user interface (GUI) is easy to use\nand understand. The tool can be invoked directly from Composer? schematic and\ndoes not require active Analog Artist? session. The tool is not dependent on\nthe use of a specific fabrication technology or Process Design Kit\ncustomization. It requires OCEAN?, Spectre? and Waveform calculator\ncapabilities to run.",

Consequently, mixing\nbetween two liquids is mainly obtained by natural diffusion which may take a\nlong time or equivalently requires centimetre length channels. To reduce time\nand length for mixing, it is possible to generate chaotic-like flows either by\nmodifying the channel geometry or by creating an external perturbation of the\nflow. In this paper, an active micromixer is presented consisting on thermal\nactuation with heating resistors. In order to disturb the liquid flow, an\noscillating transverse flow is generated by heating the liquid. Depending on\nthe value of boiling point, either bubble expansion or volumetric dilation\ncontrolled the transverse flow amplitude. A chaotic like mixing is then induced\nunder particular conditions depending on volume expansion, liquid velocity,\nfrequency of actuation... This solution presents the advantage to achieve\nmixing in a very short time (1s) and along a short channel distance (channel\nwidth). It can also be integrated in a more complex device due to actuator\nintegration with microfluidics.",

    "publish": "2007-11-21T09:51:13Z", 
    "summary": "Using Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAW), the Young's modulus, the density\nand the thickness of polycrystalline Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) films deposited\non silicon and SiO2 were measured, in excellent agreement with theory. The\ndispersion curve of the propagating SAW is calculated with a Boundary Element\nMethod (BEM)-Model based on Green's functions. The propagating SAW is generated\nwith a nanosecond laser in a narrowband scheme projecting stripes from a mask\non the surface of the sample. For this purpose a glass mask and a liquid\ncrystal display (LCD) mask are used. The slope of the SAW is then measured\nusing a probe beam setup. From the wavelength of the mask and the frequency of\nthe measured SAW, the dispersion curve is determined point by point. Fitting\nthe BEM-Model to the measured nonlinear dispersion curve provides several\nphysical parameters simultaneously. In the present work this is demonstrated\nfor the Young's modulus, the density and the thickness of SiGe films. The\nresults from the narrowband scheme measurement are in excellent agreement with\nseparated measurements of the thickness (profilometer), the density (balance)\nand the Young's modulus (nanoindenter).",

Electrode potential screening and undesirable electrochemistry in\ndielectric liquids are counteracted using AC-voltages.

    "summary": "In MEMS technology, most of the devices are fabricated on glass or silicon\nsubstrate. However, this research presents a novel manufacture method that is\nderived from conventional hot embossing technology to fabricate the\nelectrostatic switches on polymer material. The procedures of fabrication\ninvolve the metal deposition, photolithography, electroplating, hot embossing\nand hot embed techniques. The fundamental concept of the hot embed technology\nis that the temperature should be increased above Tg of polymer, and the\npolymer becomes plastic and viscous and could be molded. According to the\nfundamental concept, the metal layer on the silicon/glass substrate could be\nembedded into polymer material during the hot embossing process. Afterward, the\nmetal layer is bonded together with the polymer after removing the substrate in\nthe de-embossing step. Finally, the electrostatic switch is fabricated on\npolymethylmethacrylate(PMMA) material to demonstrate the novel method.",

    "publish": "2007-11-21T10:27:56Z", 
    "summary": "Fringing field has to be taken into account in the formulation of\nelectrostatic parallel-plate actuators when the gap separating the electrodes\nis comparable to the geometrical dimensions of the moving plate. Even in this\ncase, the existing formulations often result in complicated mathematical models\nfrom which it is difficult to determine the deflection of the moving plate for\ngiven voltages and therefore to predict the necessary applied voltages for\nactuation control. This work presents a new method for the modeling of fringing\nfield, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor.\nNumerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on\nthis model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of\ninput-to-state stabilization (ISS) and back-stepping state feedback design. The\nstability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are\ndemonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation.",

The aim of the current\npaper is to describe a computer-assisted surgical navigation system based on\nfluoroscopic X-ray image calibration and three-dimensional optical localizers\nin order to reduce radiation exposure while increasing accuracy and reliability\nof the surgical procedure for pedicle screw insertion. Instrumentation using\ntranspedicular screw fixation was performed: in a first group, a conventional\nsurgical procedure was carried out with 26 patients (138 screws); in a second\ngroup, a navigated surgical procedure (virtual fluoroscopy) was performed with\n26 patients (140 screws). Evaluation of screw placement in every case was done\nby using plain X-rays and post-operative computer tomography scan. A 5 per cent\ncortex penetration (7 of 140 pedicle screws) occurred for the computer-assisted\ngroup. A 13 per cent penetration (18 of 138 pedicle screws) occurred for the\nnon computer-assisted group. The radiation running time for each vertebra level\n(two screws) reached 3.5 s on average in the computer-assisted group and 11.5 s\non average in the non computer-assisted group. The operative time for two\nscrews on the same vertebra level reaches 10 min on average in the non\ncomputer-assisted group and 11.9 min on average in the computer-assisted group.\nThe fluoroscopy-based (two-dimensional) navigation system for pedicle screw\ninsertion is a safe and reliable procedure for surgery in the lower thoracic\nand lumbar spine.",

    "summary": "OBJECTIVE: The TER system is a robot-based tele-echography system allowing\nremote ultrasound examination. The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound\nprobe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real\nprobe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could\nbe used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from\nisolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real\nconditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting\nabdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were\nincluded in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was\ncompared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and\niliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,\ndetection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.\nRESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural\nthrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation\ncoefficient was 0.982 (P < .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance\nbetween 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence\ninterval). CONCLUSIONS: Our study on 58 patients suggests that the TER system\ncould be a reliable, acceptable, and effective robot-based system for\nperforming remote abdominal aortic ultrasound examinations.

METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. A three-dimensional real-time\nultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used, making it possible to see\nseveral reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. Fourteen\noperators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound\n(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation\nin a 3-D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the\nbiopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative\nstudy was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of\nthe needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a\nredundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in\naccuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as\ncompared to 2-D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in\nthe biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D.\nCONCLUSION: The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an\nimprovement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.\nThe biopsy distribution does not seem improved.",

Because\nultrasound imaging is patient- and operator-dependent, we have proposed to fuse\nMRI data to TRUS data to make image processing more reliable. The technical\naccuracy of this approach has already been evaluated. METHODS: We present work\nin progress concerning the evaluation of the approach from the dosimetry\nviewpoint. The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on\nthe treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS\nprostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion. RESULTS:\nFor the eight patients included, we demonstrate that TRUS prostate volume is\nmost often underestimated and that dose is overestimated in a correlated way.\nHowever, dose constraints are still verified for those eight patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This confirms our initial hypothesis.",

The international community\nis fully aware of the urgent need to secure the cyberspace as you see the\nmultiplication of security standards and national schemes interpreting them\nbeyond borders: ISO 15408, ISO 17799, and ISO 27001. Even though some\ncountries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their\nsecurity books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of\nsecurity as long as they share their networks with entities of less security.\nThe standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the\ndevelopment of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders\nhave to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the\npartnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the\ncontinuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and\ncertification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the\npartnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic\nsociety.

    "summary": "This paper explores the idea that the universe is a virtual reality created\nby information processing, and relates this strange idea to the findings of\nmodern physics about the physical world. The virtual reality concept is\nfamiliar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is\nusually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the\nworld could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional\nspace-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,\nmatter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the\nmany conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If\nthe universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no\nlonger be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is\nsuggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality\nis a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how\ncore physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could\nderive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity\nand quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates\nspace-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.",

    "summary": "Prostate brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive seeds (I125 for\ninstance) permanently in the gland for the treatment of localized prostate\ncancers, e.g., cT1c-T2a N0 M0 with good prognostic factors. Treatment planning\nand seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal\nultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is\ndifficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the\ngland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive\nseeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers.\nSince MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst\nopen MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very\ncomplex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room\nwith MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with\nbi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from\nthe data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and\nimplemented in the PROCUR system. Results are reported for a phantom and first\nseries of patients. Phantom experiments helped characterize the accuracy of the\nprocess. Patient experiments have shown that using MRI data linked with TRUS\ndata improves TRUS image segmentation especially regarding the apex and base of\nthe prostate. This may significantly modify prostate volume definition and have\nan impact on treatment planning.",

Thin\nSOI wafers are important for advanced CMOS technology and thus are evaluated as\nresonator substrates for future co-integration with CMOS circuitry on a single\nchip. As the transduction capacitance scales with the resonator thickness, it\nis important to fabricate deep sub-micron trenches in order to achieve a good\ncapacitive coupling. Through the combination of conventional UV-lithography and\nfocused ion beam (FIB) milling the process needs only two lithography steps,\nenabling therefore a way for fast prototyping of MEM-resonators. Different FIB\nparameters and etching parameters are compared in this paper and their effect\non the process are reported.",

High thermal\nisolation of these devices solves consumption problem and can be made by\ndesigning of free standing micromechanical hot plates. Mechanical stability and\na fast thermal response are especially significant parameters that can not be\nneglected. These characteristics can be achieved with new concept of GaAs\nthermal converter.",

    "summary": "Ac electrokinetic flows are commonly used for manipulating micron-scale\nparticles in a biosensor system. At the solid-liquid state there are two kinds\nof processes in the reaction between analytes and ligands: the mass transport\nprocess and the chemical reaction process. The mass transport process is\nrelated to convection and diffusion. Total or partial limit of mass transport\nwould retard the diffusion from the bulk fluid to the interface of reaction.\nThis effect decreases the possibility of adsorption of analyte and ligand\nbecause the chemical reaction is faster than the diffusion. In order to solve\nthis problem, we apply an ac electric field to induce a vortex field by the\nelectrothermal effect, which helps in increasing the rate of diffusion. By\nusing the finite element analysis software, COMSOL Multiphysics, we optimized\nseveral parameters of the microelectrode structures and the position of the\nreacting surface, i.e. the microcantilever, by a simplified 2-D model and a 3-D\nmodel. It is successful in accelerating the reacting rate of the molecule which\nis limited by mass transport. The factor of the efficiency is about 1.429 when\nthe operating voltage is 15 Vrms peak-to-peak. In addition, the surface\nconcentration of the complex on the microcantilever has been simulated.",

    "summary": "In large area micro hot embossing, the process temperature plays a critical\nrole to both the local fidelity of microstructure formation and global\nuniformity. The significance of low temperature hot embossing is to improve\nglobal flatness of embossed devices. This paper reports on experimental studies\nof polymer deformation and relaxation in micro embossing when the process\ntemperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this\ninvestigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to\ninvestigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process\ntemperature and load pressure. The depth of indentation was controlled and the\nload force at a certain indentation depth was measured. Experiments were\ncarried out using 1 mm thick PMMA films with the process temperature ranging\nfrom Tg-55 degrees C to Tg +20 degrees C. The embossed structures included a\nsingle micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. It was found that at\ntemperature of Tg-55 degrees C, elastic deformation dominated the formation of\nmicrostructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. From Tg-20\ndegrees C to Tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and\npermanent cavities could be formed on PMMA substrates without obvious\nrelaxation. However, the formation of protrusive structures as micro pillars\nwas not complete since there was little polymer flow. With an increase in\nprocess temperature, microstructure could be formed under lower loading\npressure. Considering the fidelity of a single microstructure and global\nflatness of embossed substrates, micro hot embossing at a low process\ntemperature, but with good fidelity, should be preferred.",

Contrary to common\nlogic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in\nhomogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of\nthe system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of\nthe formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the\nvalue of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different\nsubgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When\nsubjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more\nelements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo\nsuch a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative\naveraging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical\nsystem that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system\nunder analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist\nonly in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon\nproviding such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with\neach other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can\nbe achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's\nelements.

    "publish": "2008-04-13T01:11:43Z", 
    "summary": "The asynchronous systems are the models of the asynchronous circuits from the\ndigital electrical engineering. An asynchronous system f is a multi-valued\nfunction that assigns to each admissible input u a set f(u) of possible states\nx in f(u). A special case of asynchronous system consists in the existence of a\nBoolean function \\Upsilon such that for any u and any x in f(u), a certain\nequation involving \\Upsilon is fulfilled. Then \\Upsilon is called the generator\nfunction of f (Moisil used the terminology of network function) and we say that\nf is generated by \\Upsilon. The systems that have a generator function are\ncalled regular.\n  Our purpose is to continue the study of the generation of the asynchronous\nsystems that was started in [2], [3].",

    "publish": "2008-05-05T02:55:38Z", 
    "summary": "This paper describes a new method, HGV2C, for pattern analysis. The HGV2C\nmethod involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual\nobject that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly\ncreated object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to\nanalyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain\nobject. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and\nits functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and\ninfothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set\nof parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to\nequal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the\npreviously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three\nfunctions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects\nincluding two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the\ngroup into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP\nweight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the\nquery object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter\nvalues, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP\nmultiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A\nrespective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)\nbetween the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the\ndifference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly\nincreases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new\napproach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of\npopulation pyramids of 220 countries.",

Among the different\nalternatives, an interesting option is the use of inertial microgenerators for\nenergy scavenging from vibrations present in the environment. These devices\nconstitute perpetual energy sources without the need for refilling, thus being\nwell suited for abandoned sensors, wireless systems or microsystems which must\nbe embedded within the structure, without outside physical connections.\nDifferent electromagnetic energy scavenging devices have been described in the\nliterature [1,2,3], based on the use of a velocity damped resonator, which is\nwell suited for harvesting of vibrational energy induced by the operation of\nmachines. These vibrations are characterized by a well defined frequency (in\nthe range between few Hz's and few kHz's) and low displacement amplitudes.\nAdjusting the resonant frequency of the system to that of the vibrations allows\namplification of these low amplitude displacements. Moreover, for these\napplications, the use of an electromagnetic device has the potential advantages\nof a good level of compatibility with Si Microsystem technology, as well as the\npossibility of relatively high electromechanical coupling with simple designs.",

In this novel\nfabrication approach, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film was use as the\ntemplate ; the PLGA solution was then cast on it ; the vacuum air-extraction\nprocess was applied to transfer the nano porous pattern from the AAO membrane\nto the PLGA membrane and form nanostures on it. The cell culture experiments of\nthe bovine endothelial cells demonstrated that the nanostructured PLGA membrane\ncan double the cell growing rate.

This SNR micro-reactor possessing an\nin-plane dividing structure requires only simple fabrication. We investigated\nthis reactor and compared it numerically and experimentally with a\nslanted-groove micromixer (SGM). From the numerical results the mixing indices\nand mixing patterns demonstrated that the mixing ability of the SNR\nmicro-reactor was much superior to that of the SGM. From a mixing test with\nphenolphthalein and sodium hydroxide solutions, the mixing lengths of the SNR\nmicro-reactor were less than 4 mm for a Reynolds number over a wide range (Re =\n0.1 - 10). From a comparison of mixing lengths, the results revealed also that\nthe SNR micro-reactor surpassed the SGM in mixing performance by more than 200\n%. As a reaction length is a suitable test of the performance of a reactor, we\nintroduced a redox reaction between ascorbic acid and iodine solutions to\nassess the reaction capability of these micro devices ; the reaction lengths of\nthe SNR micro-reactor were much shorter than those of a SGM. The SNR\nmicro-reactor has consequently a remarkable efficiency for fluid mixing and\nreaction.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a numerical simulation and experimental results of a\none-dimensional thermal inclinometer with the cavity filled of gas and liquid.\nThe sensor principle consists of one heating resistor placed between two\ndetectors. When the resistor is electrically powered, it creates a symmetrical\ntemperature profile inside a micromachined silicon cavity. By applying a tilt\nto the sensor, the profile shifts in the same direction of the sensible axis\ncorresponding to the horizontal one to one. The temperature profile and the\nsensitivity according to the CO2 gas and mineral oil SAE50 have been studied\nusing numerical resolution of fluid dynamics equations with the computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) software package Fluent V6.2. We have shown that the\nsensitivity of liquid sensors is higher than the gas sensors one. By using\nmicromachined silicon technique, a thermal inclinometer with one pair of\ndetectors placed at 300 um from the heater has been made. Experimental\nmeasurements corroborate with the numerical simulation.",

    "summary": "This paper reports on formation of high aspect micro patterns on low\ntemperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrates by integrating micro inkjetting\nwith electroless plating. Micro inkjetting was realized by using an inkjetting\nprinter that ejects ink droplets from a printhead. This printhead consists of a\nglass nozzle with a diameter of 50 micrometers and a piezoelectric transducer\nthat is coated on the nozzle. The silver colloidal solution was inkjetted on a\nsintered CT800 ceramic substrate, followed by curing at 200 degrees C for 60\nminutes. As a result, the silver trace with a thickness of 200 nm was obtained.\nThe substrate, with the ejected silver thin film as the seed layer, was then\nimmersed into a preinitiator solution to coat a layer of palladium for\nenhancing the deposition of nickel. Electroless nickel plating was successfully\nconducted at a rate of 0.39 micrometers /min, and the thickness of traces was\nplated up to 84 micrometers. This study demonstrates that the integration of\ninkjetting with plating is an effective method to form high aspect patterns at\nthe demand location.",

Therefore, our interest in this work\nfocus on another parameter affect on the undesirable phenomena as the vortices\nin the Micro-nip. The problem deals with the flow through the Micro-nip of\nmetering size press. The flow enters and exits at a tangential velocity of 20\nm/s between two rollers with diameter 80 cm and 60 -m apart. In the upper and\nbottom part of the domain the angular velocity is 314 rad /s. It has one\nsub-domain. Previous studies focus on the Micro-nip without considering the\ninertia and the viscoelasticity of the material. Roll coating is a technique\ncommonly used in the coating industry to meter a thin fluid film on a moving\nsubstrate. During the film formation, the fluid is subjected to very high shear\nand extensional rates over a very short period of time. The fluid domain\nchanges as a function of the hydrodynamic pressure within the nip as a result\nof the deformable cover usually used on one of the rolls. The free surface also\nadds more complexity to the flow due to the force equilibrium in the fluid gas\ninterface. Last of all, the rheological behavior of the coating fluid is\nusually non-Newtonian, so the metering flow hydrodynamics is finally very\ndifficult to describe. It is concluded that the normal forces of micro-nip\nincreases with increasing the inhibitors. Therefore, it affects on the\nsmoothness and creates defects. On the other hand, it can be concluded that the\ncreation of big vortex in the middle of micro-nip affects on the coating liquid\nbehavior.",

For a 30 micrometer-wide 100\nmicrometer-long cantilever, Q-factor was measured as high as 1113 and 7279\nunder the pressure of 101.2 KPa and 35 Pa, respectively. Moreover, it was found\nthat high-mode vibration can be realized by the cantilever for the pursuit of\ngreat Q-factor, while support loss became significant because of the increased\nvibration amplitude at the actuation point. An optimized structure using\nnode-point actuation was suggested then to suppress corresponding energy\ndissipation.",

AND-EXOR based circuits are of interest in the design of very low\npower circuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is of much\nconsideration. This paper examines the testability of AND-EXOR based Iterative\nLogic Arrays (ILAs). For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set whose\nsize remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for others it\nvaries with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as Constant-Testable\n(C-Testable). It has been shown that AND-EXOR based Logic Arrays are C-Testable\nand size of test set is equal to number of entries in cell truth table. The\ntest generation problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of\ncycles in a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of\nthese cycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily\nconverted to an ATPG program has been presented for both 1D and 2D ILAs.

    "summary": "In the nano era in integrated circuit fabrication technologies, the\nperformance variability due to statistical process and circuit parameter\nvariations is becoming more and more significant. Considerable effort has been\nexpended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope\nwith the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been\naimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In\nthis paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo\nmethod for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method\nis widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing\nyield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not\nbe used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly\nfull circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing\nyield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,\nbut at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator\nis based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance\nsampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for\ncheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that\nour improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte\nCarlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.",

Consequently,\nairport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway\nqueues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations\nfrom the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield\nsignificant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a\nCollaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during\ncongested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive\nenvironment.

First, the Collaborative Virtual\nQueue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases\nwheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute\nintra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for\nairlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight\nsequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off\nbetween minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level\nof unfairness between aircraft of the same airline.

To avoid the waste of CPU resources as a\nresult of the discrete voltage levels, a resource reclaiming mechanism is\nemployed to maximize the CPU utilization and also to improve the QoC.\nSimulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.\nCompared with the optimal standard DVS scheme, the proposed scheme is shown to\nbe able to save remarkably more energy while maintaining comparable QoC.",

    "summary": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a metaheuristic for solving difficult\ndiscrete optimization problems. This paper presents a deterministic model based\non differential equation to analyze the dynamics of basic Ant System algorithm.\nTraditionally, the deposition of pheromone on different parts of the tour of a\nparticular ant is always kept unvarying. Thus the pheromone concentration\nremains uniform throughout the entire path of an ant. This article introduces\nan exponentially increasing pheromone deposition approach by artificial ants to\nimprove the performance of basic Ant System algorithm. The idea here is to\nintroduce an additional attracting force to guide the ants towards destination\nmore easily by constructing an artificial potential field identified by\nincreasing pheromone concentration towards the goal. Apart from carrying out\nanalysis of Ant System dynamics with both traditional and the newly proposed\ndeposition rules, the paper presents an exhaustive set of experiments performed\nto find out suitable parameter ranges for best performance of Ant System with\nthe proposed deposition approach. Simulations reveal that the proposed\ndeposition rule outperforms the traditional one by a large extent both in terms\nof solution quality and algorithm convergence. Thus, the contributions of the\narticle can be presented as follows: i) it introduces differential equation and\nexplores a novel method of analyzing the dynamics of ant system algorithms, ii)\nit initiates an exponentially increasing pheromone deposition approach by\nartificial ants to improve the performance of algorithm in terms of solution\nquality and convergence time, iii) exhaustive experimentation performed\nfacilitates the discovery of an algebraic relationship between the parameter\nset of the algorithm and feature of the problem environment.",

    "summary": "Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has practically penetrated\ninto all spheres of life. Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in\npublic financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance\nis defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or\ngovernmental activities, and with the administration and design of those\nactivities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public\nservices. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the\nperspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the\nreal or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived\nperformance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the\ndecision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT\ncan be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design,\nimplementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in\nany of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for\nguarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a\nservice will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed\nin order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high\nefficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be\nnoted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the\nhuman engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public\nfinancial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users\nof the services engage themselves in the success of the system. Instead of\ngiving a catalog of services, the focus has been on the model (or methodology)\nto adopt in designing services for which ICT could enhance the implementation.",

    "publish": "2009-05-21T21:34:41Z", 
    "summary": "The official meteorological network is poor on the island of Corsica: only\nthree sites being about 50 km apart are equipped with pyranometers which enable\nmeasurements by hourly and daily step. These sites are Ajaccio (seaside),\nBastia (seaside) and Corte (average altitude of 486 meters). This lack of\nweather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid\nperformance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global\nsolar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and\nhourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial\nNeural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the\nforecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the\nstation of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16\nyears from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator\nin two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region\nand Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied\nfewer errors than a naive prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468\nVs 1383Wh/m2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m2 to Corte). On hourly case, the\nresults were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence (RMSE=138.8\nVs 109.3 Wh/m2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m2 to Corte). The last\nexperiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power grid\nlocalized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio. We got errors very suitable\n(nRMSE=27.9%, RMSE=99.0 W.h) compared to those obtained with the persistence\n(nRMSE=42.2%, RMSE=149.7 W.h).",

The DIATELIC project deals with\nthe tele-monitoring of patients under peritoneal dialysis. By means of XML\nabstractions, termed as \"medical components\", to represent the patient's\nprofile, the application configures the customizable properties of the\npatient's interface and generates a UIML document dynamically. The interface\nallows the patient to feed the data manually or use a device which allows\n\"automatic data acquisition\".

    "summary": "Software inspection is a necessary and important tool for software quality\nassurance. Since it was introduced by Fagan at IBM in 1976, arguments exist as\nto which method should be adopted to carry out the exercise, whether it should\nbe paper based or tool based, and what reading technique should be used on the\ninspection document. Extensive works have been done to determine the\neffectiveness of reviewers in paper based environment when using ad hoc and\nchecklist reading techniques. In this work, we take the software inspection\nresearch further by examining whether there is going to be any significant\ndifference in defect detection effectiveness of reviewers when they use either\nad hoc or checklist reading techniques in a distributed groupware environment.\nTwenty final year undergraduate students of computer science, divided into ad\nhoc and checklist reviewers groups of ten members each were employed to inspect\na medium sized java code synchronously on groupware deployed on the Internet.\nThe data obtained were subjected to tests of hypotheses using independent T\ntest and correlation coefficients. Results from the study indicate that there\nare no significant differences in the defect detection effectiveness, effort in\nterms of time taken in minutes and false positives reported by the reviewers\nusing either ad hoc or checklist based reading techniques in the distributed\ngroupware environment studied.",

The method takes advantage of the motion-induced\nvariance of received signal strength measurements made in a wireless\npeer-to-peer network. Using a multipath channel model, we show that the signal\nstrength on a wireless link is largely dependent on the power contained in\nmultipath components that travel through space containing moving objects. A\nstatistical model relating variance to spatial locations of movement is\npresented and used as a framework for the estimation of a motion image. From\nthe motion image, the Kalman filter is applied to recursively track the\ncoordinates of a moving target. Experimental results for a 34-node through-wall\nimaging and tracking system over a 780 square foot area are presented.",

    "summary": "Computer-assisted prostate biopsies became a very active research area during\nthe last years. Prostate tracking makes it possi- ble to overcome several\ndrawbacks of the current standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy\nprocedure, namely the insufficient targeting accuracy which may lead to a\nbiopsy distribution of poor quality, the very approximate knowledge about the\nactual location of the sampled tissues which makes it difficult to implement\nfocal therapy strategies based on biopsy results, and finally the difficulty to\nprecisely reach non-ultrasound (US) targets stemming from different modalities,\nstatistical atlases or previous biopsy series. The prostate tracking systems\npresented so far are limited to rigid transformation tracking. However, the\ngland can get considerably deformed during the intervention because of US probe\npres- sure and patient movements. We propose to use 3D US combined with\nimage-based elastic registration to estimate these deformations. A fast elastic\nregistration algorithm that copes with the frequently occurring US shadows is\npresented. A patient cohort study was performed, which yielded a statistically\nsignificant in-vivo accuracy of 0.83+-0.54mm.",

    "summary": "Multiplication is an arithmetic operation that is mostly used in Digital\nSignal Processing (DSP) and communication applications. Efficient\nimplementation of the multipliers is required in many applications. The design\nand analysis of Spurious Switching Suppression Technique (SSST) equipped low\npower multiplier with hybrid encoding is presented in this paper. The proposed\nencoding technique reduces the number of switching activity and dynamic power\nconsumption by analyzing the bit patterns in the input data. In this proposed\nencoding scheme, the operation is executed depends upon the number of 1s and\nits position in the multiplier data. The architecture of the proposed\nmultiplier is designed using a low power full adder which consumes less power\nthan the other adder architectures. The switching activity of the proposed\nmultiplier has been reduced by 86 percent and 46percent compared with\nconventional and Booth multiplier respectively. It is observed from the device\nlevel simulation using TANNER 12.6 EDA that the power consumption of the\nproposed multiplier has been reduced by 87 percent and 26 percent compared with\nconventional and Booth multiplier.",

    "publish": "2010-01-13T18:14:16Z", 
    "summary": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has recently been used\nwidely in wireless communication systems. OFDM is very effective in combating\nintersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective\nchannel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio\nchannels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter\nCarrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus\ndegrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its\nsensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier\nfrequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one\nis the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to\neach of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other\ncarriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating\nthe effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are\ncompared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.\nThrough simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in\nmitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than\nthe SC method.",

Also if we continue at our\ncurrent rate of miniaturisation, laptops and other electronic devices can get\nheated up tremendously. Hence we require a better heat dissipating system to\novercome the excess heat generating problem of using nanoelectronics, which is\nexpected to power the next generation of computers. To handle the excessive and\noften unpredictable heating up of high performance electronic components like\nmicroprocessors, we need to predict the temperature profile of the heat sink\nused. This also helps us to select the best heat sink for the operating power\nrange of any microprocessor. Understanding the temperature profile of a heat\nsink and a microprocessor helps us to handle its temperature efficiently for a\nrange of loads. In this work, a method to estimate the normal response of a\nheat sink to various loads of a microprocessor is explained.",

    "summary": "The tolerancing process links the virtual and the real worlds. From the\nformer, tolerances define a variational geometrical language (geometric\nparameters). From the latter, there are values limiting those parameters. The\nbeginning of a tolerancing process is in this duality. As high precision\nassemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form errors are\nnegligible, we propose to apply this process to assemblies with form errors\nthrough a new way of allowing to parameterize forms and solve their assemblies.\nThe assembly process is calculated through a method of allowing to solve the 3D\nassemblies of pairs of surfaces having form errors using a static equilibrium.\nWe have built a geometrical model based on the modal shapes of the ideal\nsurface. We compute for the completely deterministic contact points between\nthis pair of shapes according to a given assembly process. The solution gives\nan accurate evaluation of the assembly performance. Then we compare the results\nwith or without taking into account the form errors. When we analyze a batch of\nassemblies, the problem is to compute for the nonconformity rate of a pilot\nproduction according to the functional requirements. We input probable errors\nof surfaces (position, orientation, and form) in our calculus and we evaluate\nthe quality of the results compared with the functional requirements. The pilot\nproduction then can or cannot be validated.",

One can distinguish several models with growing complexity, from\n1-dimensional (1D) to 3-dimensional (3D) (including form deviations), and two\nmain tolerancing assumptions, the worst case and the statistical hypothesis.\nThis paper presents an approach to 3D statistical tolerancing using a new\nacceptance criterion.

The modal\ncharacterisation is used to describe the form deviation of a geometry as the\ncombination of elementary deviations (location, orientation and form).

    "publish": "2010-02-01T14:46:34Z", 
    "summary": "This work is a development from the Inetforsmep European project. We proposed\nto realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made\nof several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were\nthe thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height).\nThis paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour\nerror. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the\nneeded material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on\nthe appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups\nduring forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations\ncan cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during\nmanufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming\noperations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two\nforming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is\nto reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed\nmaterial (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in\ndefining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and\nthen simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine\ntransformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming\noperation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links\nbetween the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then\npossible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears'\namplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments.\nMoreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a\nminimal material use.",

The study presents methodology to integrate solar (PV) energy (which is\nfreely available in every corner of the world) with grid source and supplement\nthe existing grid power in rural houses during its cut off or restricted supply\nperiod. In order to get consistency in supply a DG is also added as a standby\nsource in the proposed integration of network. The software using novel Direct\nPWM modulation strategy and its soft control features extend the flexibility to\ncontrol converter (inverter) parameters like voltage, frequency, number of\nsamples of PWM pulses constituting sine-wave without changing any hardware\nconfiguration in the circuit. The system simulation of PWM Pulse generation has\nbeen done on a XILINX based FPGA Spartan 3E board using VHDL code. The test on\nsimulation of PWM generation program after synthesis and compilation were\nrecorded and verified on a prototype sample.",

    "publish": "2010-03-02T17:18:52Z", 
    "summary": "The property that every control system should posses is stability, which\ntranslates into safety in real-life applications. A central tool in systems\ntheory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting\nclosed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,\npredefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired\nconverging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be\noverconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a\nstability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in\nterms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the\ndesign of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a\ncone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way\nnon-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that\ncan be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to\nclassical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for\nstabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time\ncontrol. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible\nCLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods\nbelow one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive\napplications.",

    "publish": "2010-03-16T23:46:59Z", 
    "summary": "We propose a novel theoretical biomolecular design to implement any Boolean\ncircuit using the mechanism of DNA strand displacement. The design is scalable:\nall species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single\ntest tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which\nis a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the\nconcentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of\ninput species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The\ndesign is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as\nhigh or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a\nsingle-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the\ndifference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the\ncircuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital\nabstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is\nenergy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0\nconcentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal\nconcentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic)\nequilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until\nthe input again changes.\n  Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided\nnon-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy\nmust be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at\nsteady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are\npermanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not \"generic\"; each gate\nin the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence\ndifferent circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we\nrequire input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an\ninput of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by\nthe presence of another. That is, we do not construct a \"true NOT gate\" that\nsets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration\nis low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive,\ndigital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of\nthese problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually\nincompatible.",

Optimum balance between power\ndissipation and dynamic range results when the MOS transistors are operated at\nmoderate inversion. Power is again minimised by the application of input\ndependant bias current using feedback loops in the input transistors of the\ndifferential pair with two current substractors. In comparison with the\nreported low power low voltage opamps at 0.8 micron technology, this opamp has\nvery low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates\nat low voltage. The opamp is fairly small (0.0084 mm 2) and slew rate is more\nthan other low power low voltage opamps reported at 0.8 um technology [1,2].\nVittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing\ntechnique and power dissipation can be reduced by operating the device in weak\ninversion. Though lower power dissipation is achieved the area required by the\ncircuit is very large and speed is too small. So, operating the device in\nmoderate inversion is a good solution. Also operating the device in\nsubthreshold region not only allows lower power dissipation but also a lower\nvoltage operation is achieved.",

    "summary": "In this article, we proposed a Variable threshold MOSFET(VTMOS)approach which\nis realized from Dynamic Threshold MOSFET(DTMOS), suitable for sub-threshold\ndigital circuit operation. Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is\noperating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that\nregion for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce\nthe power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing\ntechnique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS\napproach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high\ncurrent drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS\nis based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which\nvaries with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate\nand substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for\nPMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and\npower dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as\nthose of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves\nthe power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold\nregion.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is\nmade and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay\nproduct are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over\nconventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool. The dependency of these\nparameters on frequency of operation has also been investigated.",

    "summary": "Specifying QoS properties can limit the selection of some good web services\nthat the user will have considered; this is because the algorithm used strictly\nensures that there is a match between QoS properties of the consumer with that\nof the available services. This is to say that, a situation may arise that some\nservices might not have all that the user specifies but are rated high in those\nthey have. With some tradeoffs specified in form of weight, these services will\nbe made available to the user for consideration. This assertion is from the\nfact that, the user's requirements for the specified QoS properties are of\nvarying degree i.e. he will always prefer one ahead of the other. This can be\ncaptured in form of weight i.e. the one preferred most will have the highest\nweight. If a consumer specifies light weight for those QoS properties that a\nweb service is deficient in and high weight for those it has, this will\nminimize the difference between them.

CAM software can help in estimating that time for a given strategy.\nBut in practice, CAM-programmed feed rates are rarely achieved, especially\nwhere complex surface finishing is concerned. This means that machining time\nforecasts are often more than one step removed from reality. The reason behind\nthis is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the\nmachines or their specific machining tolerances into account. The present\narticle seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour\nand machining time prediction, offering two models. The first contributes\nthrough enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular\ninterpolation, taking high-speed machine accelerations and jerks into account.\nThe second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in\nthe simulation by adding in a polynomial transition path that caters for the\ntrue machining environment tolerances. Models are based on respect for path\nmonitoring. Experimental validation shows the contribution of polynomial\nmodelling of the transition passage due to the absence of a leap in\nacceleration. Simulation error on the machining time prediction remains below\n1%.",

    "summary": "Determination of design parameters based on electromagnetic simulations of\nmicrowave circuits is an iterative and often time-consuming procedure. Space\nmapping is a powerful technique to optimize such complex models by efficiently\nsubstituting accurate but expensive electromagnetic models, fine models, with\nfast and approximate models, coarse models. In this paper, we apply two space\nmapping, an explicit space mapping as well as an implicit and response residual\nspace mapping, techniques to a case study application, a microstrip band-pass\nfilter. First, we model the case study application and optimize its design\nparameters, using explicit space mapping modelling approach. Then, we use\nimplicit and response residual space mapping approach to optimize the filter's\ndesign parameters. Finally, the performance of each design methods is\nevaluated. It is shown that the use of above-mentioned techniques leads to\nachieving satisfactory design solutions with a minimum number of\ncomputationally expensive fine model evaluations.",

In a conventional\nPID controller, what is modeled is the system or process being controlled,\nwhereas in the Fuzzy logic controller, the focus is the human operator\nbehavior.

    "publish": "2010-08-18T16:51:20Z", 
    "summary": "The LMS algorithm is one of the most successful adaptive filtering\nalgorithms. It uses the instantaneous value of the square of the error signal\nas an estimate of the mean-square error (MSE). The LMS algorithm changes\n(adapts) the filter tap weights so that the error signal is minimized in the\nmean square sense. In Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS), two\nnew versions of LMS algorithms, same formulations are performed as in the LMS\nalgorithm with the exception that filter tap weights are now expressed using\ntrigonometric and hyperbolic formulations, in cases for TLMS and HLMS\nrespectively. Hence appears the CORDIC algorithm as it can efficiently perform\ntrigonometric, hyperbolic, linear and logarithmic functions. While\nhardware-efficient algorithms often exist, the dominance of the software\nsystems has kept those algorithms out of the spotlight. Among these hardware-\nefficient algorithms, CORDIC is an iterative solution for trigonometric and\nother transcendental functions. Former researches worked on CORDIC algorithm to\nobserve the convergence behavior of Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) algorithm and\nobtained a satisfactory result in the context of convergence performance of\nTLMS algorithm. But revious researches directly used the CORDIC block output in\ntheir simulation ignoring the internal step-by-step rotations of the CORDIC\nprocessor. This gives rise to a need for verification of the convergence\nperformance of the TLMS algorithm to investigate if it actually performs\nsatisfactorily if implemented with step-by-step CORDIC rotation. This research\nwork has done this job. It focuses on the internal operations of the CORDIC\nhardware, implements the Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS)\nalgorithms using actual CORDIC rotations. The obtained simulation results are\nhighly satisfactory and also it shows that convergence behavior of HLMS is much\nbetter than TLMS.",

In this paper, therefore, we review the main concepts of\nautopoiesis and then discuss how they could be related to fundamental concepts\nand theories of computation.

The low-level programming and\ncompatibility problems of the J2ME, along with UI designing difficulties, makes\nit hard for most people -even programmers- to broadcast their content to the\nwidespread mobile phones used by nearly all people. This system provides\nuser-friendly, PC-based tools for creating a tree index of pages and inserting\nmultiple multimedia contents (e.g. sound, video and picture) in each page for\ncreating a J2ME mobile application. The output is a stand-alone Java mobile\napplication that has a user interface, shows texts and pictures and plays music\nand videos regardless of the type of devices used as long as the devices\nsupport the J2ME platform. Bitmap fonts have also been used thus Middle Eastern\nlanguages can be easily supported on all mobile phone devices. We omitted\nprogramming concepts for users in order to simplify multimedia content-oriented\nmobile application designing for use in educational, cultural or marketing\ncenters.

The main idea behind the present\nresearch work is to identify the maximum number of indistinguishable faults\npresent in the given circuit and minimize the number of test cases based on the\nnumber of faults that has been detected. Heuristic approach is used for test\nminimization part, which identifies the essential tests from overall test\ncases. From the results it is observed that, test minimization varies from 50%\nto 99% with the lowest one corresponding to a circuit with four gates .Test\nminimization is low in case of circuits with lesser input leads in gates\ncompared to greater input leads in gates for the boolean expression with same\nnumber of symbols. Achievement of 99% reduction is due to the fact that the\nlarge number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for\nsimple circuits. The results show potential for both smaller test sets and\nlower cpu times.",

    "summary": "Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as a universally applicable\nability such as reading and writing. In this paper, we describe an innovative\npedagogy using Rapid Digital Game Creation (RDGC) for learning CT skills. RDGC\ninvolves the rapid building of digital games with high-level software that\nrequires little or no programming knowledge. We analyze how RDGC supports\nvarious CT concepts and how it may be mapped to equivalent Java concepts by\nbuilding the same game using both RDGC and Java. We discuss the potential\nbenefits of this approach for attracting computing majors, as a precursor to\nlearning formal programming languages, for learning domain knowledge, and for\nbridging the digital divide. We present the implications of this work for\nteachers and researchers.",

For this purpose SRAM based FPGAs are utilized.\nThis flexible ARINC429 solution gives exactly what is needed for real time\napplications. The IP can be programmed to send an interrupt to the host and\nalso prepare it to process the data. Majority of the hardware function of\ndigital natures are embedded into a single FPGA by saving in terms of PCB board\nspace, power consumption and volume results.

Quantum collapse is the irreversible event that gives time its direction.\nIn this model, empty space is null processing, directions are node links, time\nis processing cycles, light is a processing wave, objects are wave tangles and\nenergy is the processing transfer rate.

Within a short\nperiod, NATO adapted this method family as the NATO Consultation, Command, and\nControl (C3) System Architecture Framework to harmonize the efforts of the\ndifferent nations. Based on these products, for every system to be fielded to\nbe used in the US Armed Forces, a C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) has to be developed\nenabling the integration of the special system into the integrated C4I\nArchitecture. The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects\noperational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the\ntechnical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the\nnetwork centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a\nvaluable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A). Their\napplication is not limited to C4ISR systems; they can be used to define\nrequirements and connected solutions and algorithms of Modeling and Simulation\n(M&S) systems as well. Especially for M&S systems to be used in connection with\nC4ISR system, the use of the C4ISR Architecture Framework would not only be a\nhelp, but can nearly be seen to be necessary to avoid double work and foster\nreuse and interoperability from the first stages of a project on. To enable the\nreader to build his own picture, the respective tools used and their\napplication in the context of VV&A will be explained in form of an overview.",

A major setback is that squeezed logic variables\nare unable to work in the hyperspace, because the logic-low zero value sets the\nhyperspace product vector to zero. This paper proposes Boolean universal logic\ngates that alleviate such shortcomings. They are able to work with non-squeezed\nlogic values where both the high and low values are encoded into nonzero,\nbipolar, independent random telegraph waves.

The modelled strategies are the\nshortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path\napproach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path\napproach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment\nand are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit\nanalysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different\nstrategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which\nappears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an\nevacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The\ncriteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the\nindividual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size\nitself. The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria\nare investigated. The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g. broken\nescape route) is also analysed.

A solution to overcome this problem is to design\nthe beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the\nreceiver to the transmitter. In the case of limited feedback, the beamforming\nvector is limited to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter\nand receiver.When the feedback is strictly limited, important issues are how to\nquantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in\nassociated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback\navailable.In this paper channel quantization schema using simple approach to\ncodebook design (random vector quantization)is illustrated. Performance results\nshow that even with a few bits of feedback, performance can be close to that\nwith perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter.",

    "summary": "Recent evolutions on forging process induce more complex shape on forging\ndie. These evolutions, combined with High Speed Machining (HSM) process of\nforging die lead to important increase in time for machining preparation. In\nthis context, an original approach for generating machining process based on\nmachining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to\ndecompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features.\nTechnological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric\nfeature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as\nmaterial, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging\nprocess and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and\nmachining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between\nthe surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification\ncutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die,\nare associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining\nprocess model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded\nin the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining\nstrategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the\ncomplete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical\nfeatures is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining\nknowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL\nmodels. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape\ngives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the\ncontinuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an\nindustrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.",

    "publish": "2011-05-25T15:00:21Z", 
    "summary": "A fruitful approach for solving signal deconvolution problems consists of\nresorting to a frame-based convex variational formulation. In this context,\nparallel proximal algorithms and related alternating direction methods of\nmultipliers have become popular optimization techniques to approximate\niteratively the desired solution. Until now, in most of these methods, either\nLipschitz differentiability properties or tight frame representations were\nassumed. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to relax these\nassumptions by considering a class of non necessarily tight frame\nrepresentations, thus offering the possibility of addressing a broader class of\nsignal restoration problems. In particular, it is possible to use non\nnecessarily maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction, which\nare common tools in digital signal processing. The proposed approach allows us\nto solve both frame analysis and frame synthesis problems for various noise\ndistributions. In our simulations, it is applied to the deconvolution of data\ncorrupted with Poisson noise or Laplacian noise by using (non-tight) discrete\ndual-tree wavelet representations and filter bank structures.",

In this\ndirection, we consider a stochastic contention based medium access scheme,\nwhere the devices may choose to turn off for some time in order to save energy.\nWe perform an analysis for a slotted ALOHA scenario and we show that the energy\nconstraints, if properly exploited, may reduce contention for the medium. Our\nresults give valuable insights on the energy--throughput tradeoff for any\ncontention based system.",

    "summary": "Within the context of High Speed Machining, it is essential to manage the\ntrajectory generation to achieve both high surface quality and high\nproductivity. As feed drives are one part of the set Machine tool - Numerical\nController, it is necessary to improve their performances to optimize feed\ndrive dynamics during trajectory follow up. Hence, this paper deals with the\nmodelling of the feed drive in the case of multi axis machining. This model can\nbe used for the simulation of axis dynamics and tool-path tracking to tune\nparameters and optimize new frameworks of command strategies. A procedure of\nidentification based on modern NC capabilities is presented and applied to\nindustrial HSM centres. Efficiency of this modelling is assessed by\nexperimental verifications on various representative trajectories. After\nimplementing a Generalized Predictive Control, reliable simulations are\nperformed thanks to the model. These simulations can then be used to tune\nparameters of this new framework according to the tool-path geometry.",

The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual\ntool center point position as recorded with a non-contact measuring instrument\ncalled CapBall to evaluate the total geometric errors. The novelty of the work\nlies in the method that is proposed to decompose the geometric errors in two\ncategories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed of the\ntrajectory and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed\nrate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the\nacceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions for\ncontouring errors, quasi-static geometric errors and dynamic geomet- ric errors\nis experimentally evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and\ndynamic errors is highlighted.",

One of the aspects of context-aware adaptation is reconfiguration\nin which bindings are created between application component and remote services\nin order to realize new behaviour in response to contextual information.\nVarious research efforts provide reconfiguration support and allow the\ndevelopment of adaptive context-aware applications from high-level\nspecifications, but don't consider failure conditions that might arise during\nexecution of such applications, making bindings between application and remote\nservices invalid. To this end, we propose and implement our design approach to\nreconfiguration to manage invalid bindings.

Our model's\nparameters are derived from a unique data set provided by a large food bank and\nfood rescue organization in north central Colorado. We find that food supply is\na non-parametric heavy-tailed process that is well-modeled with an extreme\nvalue peaks-over-threshold model. Although the underlying process is\nstochastic, the basic approach of food rescue and redistribution appears to be\nfeasible both at small and large scales. The ultimate efficacy of this model is\nintimately tied to the rate at which food expires and hence the ability to\npreserve and quickly transport and redistribute food. The cost of the\nredistribution is tied to the number and density of participating suppliers,\nand costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional\ndonors to participate. Our results show that with sufficient funding and\nmanpower, a significant amount of food can be rescued from the waste stream and\nused to feed the hungry.",

Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure\nfrom bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently\nworked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of\ninformation by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,\nefficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research\nas an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark\nis needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but\nbiological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional\nengineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of\ncomputability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the\nprevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,\nconventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).\nHowever, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here\nthat biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us\ntowards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must\nturn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can\nand should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.\nBiological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then\nthe focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but\ncomputation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier.

The resultant 'device shrinking'\nreduces the soft error tolerance of the VLSI circuits, as very little energy is\nneeded to change their states. Safety critical systems are very sensitive to\nsoft errors. A bit flip due to soft error can change the value of critical\nvariable and consequently the system control flow can completely be changed\nwhich leads to system failure.

    "summary": "Space and time are basic categories of any top-level ontology. They are\nfundamental assumptions for the mode of existence of those individuals which\nare said to be in space and time. In the present paper the ontology of space in\nthe General Formal Ontology (GFO) is expounded. This ontology is represented as\na theory BT (Brentano Theory), which is specified by a set of axioms formalized\nin first-order logic. This theory uses four primitive relations: SReg(x) (x is\nspace region), spart(x, y) (x is spatial part of y), sb(x, y) (x is spatial\nboundary of y), and scoinc(x, y) (x and y spatially coincide). This ontology is\ninspired by ideas of Franz Brentano. The investigation and exploration of Franz\nBrentano's ideas on space and time began about twenty years ago by work of R.M.\nChisholm, B. Smith and A. Varzi. The present paper takes up this line of\nresearch and makes a further step in establishing an ontology of space which is\nbased on rigorous logical methods and on principles of the new philosophical\napproach of integrative realism.",

    "summary": "For Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and System-on-Chip (SOC)\ndesigns, Cell - Based Design (CBD) is the most prevalent practice as it\nguarantees a shorter design cycle, minimizes errors and is easier to maintain.\nIn modern ASIC design, standard cell methodology is practiced with sizable\nlibraries of cells, each containing multiple implementations of the same logic\nfunctionality, in order to give the designer differing options based on area,\nspeed or power consumption. For such library cells, thorough verification of\nfunctionality and timing is crucial for the overall success of the chip, as\neven a small error can prove fatal due to the repeated use of the cell in the\ndesign. Both formal and simulation based methods are being used in the industry\nfor cell verification. We propose a method using the latter approach that\ngenerates an optimized set of test vectors for verification of sequential\ncells, which are guaranteed to give complete Single Input Change transition\ncoverage with minimal redundancy. Knowledge of the cell functionality by means\nof the State Table is the only prerequisite of this procedure.",

In medical environments, MPU\ndecodes the mopcs and executes a series of medical sub-processes and sends out\nsecondary commands to the medical machine. Whereas operands in a typical\ncomputer system are numerical and logical entities, the operands in medical\nmachine are objects such as such as patients, blood samples, tissues, operating\nrooms, medical staff, medical bills, patient payments, etc. We follow the\nfunctional overlap between the two processes and evolve the design of medical\ncomputer systems and networks.",

To evaluate the requirements of such a\nsystem in terms of sensors and signal processing we compare two designs. The\nfirst one uses only one scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode and the\npower in the alpha frequency band. The second one uses sixteen scalp EEG\nelectrodes and machine learning methods. The role of muscular activity is also\nevaluated using five electrodes positioned on the face and the neck. Results\nshow that the first design enabled 70% of the participants to successfully\ncontrol the game, whereas 100% of the participants managed to do it with the\nsecond design based on machine learning. Subjective questionnaires confirm\nthese results: users globally felt to have control in both designs, with an\nincreased feeling of control in the second one. Offline analysis of face and\nneck muscle activity shows that this activity could also be used to distinguish\nbetween relaxation and concentration tasks. Results suggest that the\ncombination of muscular and brain activity could improve performance of this\nkind of system.

    "summary": "Emerging sonography techniques often imply increasing in the number of\ntransducer elements involved in the imaging process. Consequently, larger\namounts of data must be acquired and processed by the beamformer. The\nsignificant growth in the amounts of data effects both machinery size and power\nconsumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems\nreduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected\nsignals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate\nreduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite\nRate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which\ncombines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in\nCompressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual\ntransducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is\nlimited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous\nparameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the\nlow-rate samples. In our work, we manage to achieve such SNR enhancement, by\nbeamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer\nto this process as \"compressed beamforming\". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound\ndata, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly\neight-fold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.",

Various systems provide reconfiguration support and offer high-level\nreconfiguration directives to develop adaptive context-aware applications, but\ndo not address this performance bottleneck. We address this issue and implement\nseamless caching of virtual stubs within our PCRA1 for improved performance. In\nthis paper we present and describe our transparent caching support and also\nprovide its performance evaluation.",

The scope of the engagement was to establish a standard set of\nprocesses based on CMMI\\textregistered and ITIL\\textregistered Framework across\nfour business verticals scattered in Europe, United States and Asia. The\nservices of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were\nleveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as\nthe Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS\nimplementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at\nthe organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the\nbusiness verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and\nmanaged by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be\nachieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity. This called for a need to\ndevise an innovative implementation solution before moving to a process\nimplementation model which proposed Project Managers implementing processes\nthemself. While there are process models and frameworks available in the market\nfor establishing processes in an organization, there is no model that\nelaborates activities to be performed by the SQA for effective implementation\nof processes.

    "summary": "The digital gates are basic electronic component of any digital circuit.\nDigital circuit should be simplified in order to reduce its cost by reducing\nnumber of digital gates required to implement it. To achieve this, we use\nBoolean expression that helps in obtaining minimum number of terms and does not\ncontain any redundant pair. Karnaugh map(K-map) and Quine-McCluskey(QM) methods\nare well known methods to simplify Boolean expression. K-map method becomes\ncomplex beyond five variable Boolean expression. Quine-McCluskey method is\ncomputer based technique for minimization of Boolean function and it is faster\nthan K-map method.

    "summary": "With the advances in computational technologies over the last decade, large\norganizations have been investing in Information Technology to automate their\ninternal processes to cut costs and efficiently support their business\nprojects. However, this comes to a price. Business requirements always change.\nLikewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of\nthem, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and\nconfigure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by\ndifferent types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing\nwas conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.\nEssentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,\nself-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT\nprocesses without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model\nbased on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,\nnamely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security\npermissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of\nthe original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to\nturn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments\nconducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization\nfor C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business\nrequirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++\nare to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and\nMac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring\nmodel.",

    "summary": "A novel design for a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator is presented and\ndedicated to power many sections of a typical cellular handset. However, these\nbaseband, RF, and audio sections have different requirements that influence\nwhich LDO is most appropriate. After discussion of the specific requirements,\ndifferent LDOs are recommended. Also, some LDO design techniques are briefly\ndiscussed to demonstrate how an LDO may be optimized for a specific level of\nperformance. Cellular phone designs require linear regulators with lowdropout,\nlow-noise, high PSRR, low quiescent current (Iq), and low-cost. They need to\ndeliver a stable output and use smallvalue output capacitors. Ideally, one\ndevice would have all these characteristics and one low-dropout linear\nregulator (LDO) could be used anywhere in the phone without worry. But in\npractice, the various cell phone blocks are best powered by LDOs with different\nperformance characteristics. This paper provides a new design methodology to\nchoosing the right LDO to power each cell phone and especially for the Voltage\nPhase-Locked loops (VPLLs) blocks. Fabricated in a 0.18 {\\mu}m CMOS process,\nthe measured results show the adopted topology achieves a better phase noise\nthan the conventional saturation current source. and the spread of the current\nlimitation (without matching) is 100mA, the VPLLs system demonstrates a phase\nnoise of 782 nv/sqrtHz at 100-kHz, and 33 nv/sqrtHz at 1 MHz, while quiescent\ncurrent 33 {\\mu}A from a 2.6 V supply voltage.",

There are instances\nwhere highly critical tasks need to be introduced at a least expected\ncatastrophe and it cannot be ensured to meet all deadline in selected\nprocessors because of the arrival pattern of such tasks and they bear low\ntolerance of time to meet the required target.

Previous studies\nhave reported that under specific conditions, i.e. when a random train of\nPoissonian distributed spikes are used as inputs, and weight changes occur\naccording to STDP, it has been shown that the BCM rule is an emergent property.\nHere, the applied STDP rule can be either classical pair-based STDP rule, or\nthe more powerful triplet-based STDP rule. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nuse of two distinct VLSI circuit implementations of STDP to examine whether BCM\nlearning is an emergent property of STDP. These circuits are stimulated with\nrandom Poissonian spike trains. The first circuit implements the classical\npair-based STDP, while the second circuit realizes a previously described\ntriplet-based STDP rule. These two circuits are simulated using 0.35 um CMOS\nstandard model in HSpice simulator.

    "summary": "The Portuguese Technological Plan for Education (TPE) was established to\nmodernize schools and to consolidate the role of Information and Communication\nTechnologies (ICT) in order to promote the academic success of students and\nallow schools to be transformed into technological enriched environments\nthrough a significant learning and knowledge building in a participatory,\ncollaborative and sharing logic. With this work we aimed to establish dynamical\ninteractions students-content- teacher in order to overcome a diagnosed\nstudents' lack of effort towards studying curriculum chemistry content. Our\nmethodology design is a theoretical and descriptive one, carried out in a\nsecondary school during the 2009/2010 school year, in order to answer the\nquestion \"How to improve the engagement of K-12 students in chemistry\nclasses?\". Students, gathered in small groups were asked to create digital\nlearning resources (DLR) during classes. The teacher assumed the role of the\nsupervisor, coacher and facilitator of every task that had to be taken or\nchosen by the students. To enhance interaction student-student and\nstudent-teacher, a Twitter account and a Ning site were created for the class.\nBoth supported the Social Learning Environment (SLE) that was intended to be\ncreated. The data collected led us to satisfactory results in what concerns the\ngoals of the study. The affordances and constraints of SLE as an open\narchitecture that has potential to facilitate collaborative learning are\ndelineated. Future work should focus on mechanisms that allow assessment both\nof the methodology used and the students' generated content in order to improve\nstudents' learning in this environment.",

    "summary": "Wireless communication has penetrated into all fields of technology,\nespecially in mobility, where wireless transactions are gaining importance with\nimprovements in standards like 3G and 4G. There are many technologies that\nsupport the wireless forms of interactions between devices. One among them is\nNFC - Near Field Communication. In addition to NFC, other external technologies\nlike Quick Response (QR) Codes assist in establishing interactions among\nparticipating devices. In this paper, we examine an approach that will involve\nstandards and technologies like NFC, QR Codes and Cloud Infrastructure to\ndesign a mobile application which will perform desired functionalities. Cloud\nStorage is used as a reservoir to store the artifacts used by the application.\nDevelopment and testing of the application is initially carried out on\nemulators or simulators followed by testing on real handsets/devices.",

    "publish": "2012-03-09T13:40:22Z", 
    "summary": "A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of spatially\ndistributed autonomous devices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical\nor environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure,\nmotion or pollutants, at different locations. During RF transmission energy\nconsumed by critically energy-constrained sensor nodes in a WSN is related to\nthe life time system, but the life time of the system is inversely proportional\nto the energy consumed by sensor nodes. In that regard, modulated\nbackscattering (MB) is a promising design choice, in which sensor nodes send\ntheir data just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the\nincident signal coming from an RF source. Hence wireless passive sensor\nnetworks (WPSN) designed to operate using MB do not have the lifetime\nconstraints. In this we are going to investigate the system analytically. To\nobtain interference-free communication connectivity with the WPSN nodes number\nof RF sources is determined and analyzed in terms of output power and the\ntransmission frequency of RF sources, network size, RF source and WPSN node\ncharacteristics. The results of this paper reveal that communication coverage\nand RF Source Power can be practically maintained in WPSN through careful\nselection of design parameters",

    "summary": "MIPS machine code is very structured: registers used before are likely to be\nused again, some instructions and registers are used more heavily than others,\nsome instructions often follow each other and so on. Standard file compression\nutilities, such as gzip and bzip2, does not take full advantage of the\nstructure because they work on byte-boundaries and don't see the underlying\ninstruction fields. My idea is to filter opcodes, registers and immediates from\nMIPS binary code into distinct streams and compress them individually to\nachieve better compression ratios. Several different ways to split MIPS code\ninto streams are considered. The results presented in this paper shows that a\nsimple filter can reduce final compressed size by up to 10 % with gzip and\nbzip2.",

    "summary": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are gaining recognition in\ndeveloping countries like India. This paper describes the various components of\nour prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System\n(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted\nunits, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises\ncomprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the\nvehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service\n(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server\npredicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time\nobservations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.\nThis information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using\nstation units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via\nGPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility\nwhich automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along\nthe new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any\nroute. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for\npassengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus\nlocations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport\nauthority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of\ntrips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a\ncampus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses. The\nautomatic real-time passenger information system has the potential of making\nthe public transport system an attractive alternative for city-dwellers,\nthereby contributing to fewer private vehicles on the road, leading to lower\ncongestion levels and less pollution.",

    "summary": "This paper mainly investigates the circular open dimension problem (CODP),\nwhich consists of packing a set of circles of known radii into a strip of fixed\nwidth and unlimited length without overlapping. The objective is to minimize\nthe length of the strip. An iterated tabu search approach, named ITS, is\nproposed. ITS starts from a randomly generated solution and attempts to gain\nimprovements by a tabu search procedure. After that, if the obtained solution\nis not feasible, a perturbation operator is subsequently employed to\nreconstruct the incumbent solution and an acceptance criterion is implemented\nto determine whether or not accept the perturbed solution. This process is\nrepeated until a feasible solution has been found or the allowed computation\ntime has been elapsed. Computational experiments based on well-known benchmark\ninstances show that ITS produces quite competitive results with respect to the\nbest known results. For 18 representative CODP instances taken from the\nliterature, ITS succeeds in improving 13 best known results within reasonable\ntime. In addition, for another challenging related variant: the problem of\npacking arbitrary sized circles into a circular container, ITS also succeeds in\nimproving many best known results. Supplementary experiments are also provided\nto analyze the influence of the perturbation operator, as well as the\nacceptance criterion.",

    "publish": "2012-06-24T12:36:06Z", 
    "summary": "There is growing recognition that the overall client-vendor relationship, and\nnot only the contract, plays a critical role in Information Technology\nOutsourcing (ITO) success. However, our understanding of how ITO relationships\nfunction is limited. This paper contributes to this understanding by reviewing\nempirical literature on ITO success in terms of relationship satisfaction. A\nkey finding is that the majority of reviewed studies concentrates on client\nsatisfaction, thus neglecting the vendor perspective. We argue that this raises\nquestions about the construct validity of these studies. Consequently, concerns\nexist about the validity and reliability of their empirical findings. Some\nscholars have acknowledged the problem and use a dyadic perspective. However, a\nreview of these studies reveals that the authors have underestimated their\ncontributions and do not explain why there is a problem. Therefore, the purpose\nof this paper is to highlight their contributions by comparing the findings of\nthe dyadic perspective studies with those of the \"client perspective\" research.\nIn doing so, we assess whether the dyadic studies produce better explanations\nfor ITO success than the client-oriented studies. We argue that this is indeed\nthe case, by producing a better view on how underlying mechanisms of ITO\nrelationships work.",

    "publish": "2012-07-02T06:34:33Z", 
    "summary": "Complex shapes are widely used to design products in several industries such\nas aeronautics, automotive and domestic appliances. Several variations of their\ncurvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or\nthe machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of\nseveral parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of\nshapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure\nparts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several\ndeep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High\nSpeed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity\nlevel because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is\ngenerally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be\nsufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to\nan important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the\nCAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise\nchoice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for\nprismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely\nimplemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds\nof CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging\ndies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining\nareas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these\nareas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining\npreparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of\ncomplex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas\nextracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models\nof the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant\nduring machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he\ncarried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is\nbased on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which\nrepresent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical\nfeatures which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the\nidentification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.\nDetailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging\ndies is presented in the last part of the paper.",

    "summary": "An extremely important part of the finishing line is the pickling process, in\nwhich oxides formed during the hot rolling stage are removed from the surface\nof the steel sheets. The efficiency of the pickling process is mainly dependent\non the nature of the oxide present at the surface of the steel, but, also, on\nprocess parameters such as bath composition and time duration are relevant.\nWhen acid concentration, solution temperatures and line speed are not properly\nbalanced, in fact, sheet defects like under pickling or over pickling may\nhappen and their occurrence does have a very serious effect on cold-reduction\nperformance and surface appearance of the finished product. Furthermore,\nproduct damage from handling or improper equipment adjustment can render the\nsteel unsuitable for further processing. This is the reason why it is important\nthat process significant parameters are controlled and maintained as accurately\nas possible in order to avoid these undesired phenomena. In the present work, a\ncontrol algorithm, composed by two different modules, i.e. decision tree and\nrectangular Basis Function Network, has been implemented to aim of predicting\npickling defects and suggesting the optimal speed or the admissible speed range\nof the steel strip in the process line. In this way the most suitable line\nspeed value can be set in an automatic way or by the technical personnel.",

The time-average statistical\nproperties and the corresponding variance are also investigated to justify that\nthe proposed simulators achieve good convergence performance.\n  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed for various statistical\nproperties to validate the proposed simulators. Results show that the\nsimulators provide fast convergence to all desired statistical properties,\nincluding the probability density function (PDF), various auto- and\ncross-correlations, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fading duration\n(AFD).\n  While various tests and measurements in dense scattering urban and forest\nenvironments indicate that mobile-to-mobile channels may experience cascaded\nRayleigh fading, the proposed statistical models can be applied to simulate the\nunderlying channels.",

    "summary": "We propose that designing a manufacturer's equipment-based service value\nproposition in outcome-based contracts is the design of a new business model\ncapable of managing threats to the firm's viability that can arise from the\ncontextual variety of use that customers may subject the firm's value\npropositions. Furthermore, manufacturers need to understand these emerging\nbusiness models as the capability of managing both asset and service provision\nto achieve use outcomes with customers, including emotional outcomes such as\ncustomer experience. Service-Dominant Logic proposes that all \"goods are a\ndistribution mechanism for service provision\", upon which we propose a\nvalue-centric approach to understanding the interactions between the asset and\nservice provision, and suggest a viable systems approach towards reorganising\nthe firm to achieve such a business model. Three case studies of B2B\nequipment-based service systems were analysed to understand customers'\nco-creation activities in achieving outcomes, in which we found that the\nco-creation of complex multi-dimensional value could be delivered through the\ndifferent value propositions of the firm catering to different aspects\n(dimensions) of the value to be co-created. The study provides a way for\nmanagers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of firms in\nadopting emerging business models that design for value co-creation in what are\nultimately complex socio- technical systems.",

    "summary": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) multistatic radar can be used for target detection and\ntracking in buildings and rooms. Target detection and tracking relies on\naccurate knowledge of the bistatic delay. Noise, measurement error, and the\nproblem of dense, overlapping multipath signals in the measured UWB channel\nimpulse response (CIR) all contribute to make bistatic delay estimation\nchallenging. It is often assumed that a calibration CIR, that is, a measurement\nfrom when no person is present, is easily subtracted from a newly captured CIR.\nWe show this is often not the case. We propose modeling the difference between\na current set of CIRs and a set of calibration CIRs as a hidden Markov model\n(HMM). Multiple experimental deployments are performed to collect CIR data and\ntest the performance of this model and compare its performance to existing\nmethods. Our experimental results show an RMSE of 2.85 ns and 2.76 ns for our\nHMM-based approach, compared to a thresholding method which, if the ideal\nthreshold is known a priori, achieves 3.28 ns and 4.58 ns. By using the\nBaum-Welch algorithm, the HMM-based estimator is shown to be very robust to\ninitial parameter settings. Localization performance is also improved using the\nHMM-based bistatic delay estimates.",

It starts with a\nweak hardware unit, determines if and when a strong unit is needed, and\nseamlessly migrates to the strong one when necessary. Guadalupe not only makes\nmore computing resources available to mobile web browsing but also improves its\nenergy proportionality. Based on Chrome for Android and TI OMAP4, We provide a\nprototype browser implementation for resource loading and rendering. Compared\nto Chrome for Android, we show that Guadalupe browser for rendering can\nincrease other 3D application's frame rate by up to 767% and save 4.7% of the\nentire system's energy consumption.

Electric load\nprofiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by\nmorning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand\nin the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning\nappliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM\npilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and\nReunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF,\ninstitutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME)\nand construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and\nseveral other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions,\narchitects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal\nconception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of\noptimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of\npassive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy\nefficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort\nwithin the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building\nsimulation software (CODYRUN).

We describe this idea by discussing its basic design components\nwithin a generic algorithmic scheme and we propose some simple and intuitive\nstrategies to guide the search when traversing the neighborhood tree. We\nconduct a thorough experimental analysis of this approach by considering two\ndifferent problem domains, namely, the Total Weighted Tardiness Problem\n(SMTWTP), and the more sophisticated Location Routing Problem (LRP). We show\nthat independently of the considered domain, the approach is highly\ncompetitive.

    "summary": "Over the past few years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based on-chip\nresonators have shown significant potential for sensing and high frequency\nsignal processing applications. This is due to their excellent features like\nsmall size, large frequency-quality factor product, low power consumption, low\ncost batch fabrication, and integrability with CMOS IC technology. Radio\nfrequency communication circuits like reference oscillators, filters, and\nmixers based on such MEMS resonators can be utilized for meeting the increasing\ncount of RF components likely to be demanded by the next generation\nmulti-band/multi-mode wireless devices. MEMS resonators can provide a feasible\nalternative to the present day well established quartz crystal technology that\nis riddled with major drawbacks like relatively large size, high cost, and low\ncompatibility with IC chips. This article presents a survey of the developments\nin this field of resonant MEMS structures with detailed enumeration on the\nvarious micromechanical resonator types, modes of vibration, equivalent\nmechanical and electrical models, materials and technologies used for\nfabrication, and the application of the resonators for implementing oscillators\nand filters. These are followed by a discussion on the challenges for RF MEMS\ntechnology in comparison to quartz crystal technology; like high precision,\nstability, reliability, need for hermetic packaging etc. which remain to be\naddressed for enabling the inclusion of micromechanical resonators into\ntomorrow's highly integrated communication systems.",

    "summary": "In this paper,we present Generic System Verilog Universal Verification\nMethodology based Reusable Verification Environment for efficient verification\nof Image Signal Processing IP's/SoC's. With the tight schedules on all projects\nit is important to have a strong verification methodology which contributes to\nFirst Silicon Success. Deploy methodologies which enforce full functional\ncoverage and verification of corner cases through pseudo random test scenarios\nis required. Also, standardization of verification flow is needed. Previously,\ninside imaging group of ST, Specman (e)/Verilog based Verification Environment\nfor IP/Subsystem level verification and C/C++/Verilog based Directed\nVerification Environment for SoC Level Verification was used for Functional\nVerification. Different Verification Environments were used at IP level and SoC\nlevel. Different Verification/Validation Methodologies were used for SoC\nVerification across multiple sites. Verification teams were also looking for\nthe ways how to catch bugs early in the design cycle? Thus, Generic System\nVerilog Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based Reusable Verification\nEnvironment is required to avoid the problem of having so many methodologies\nand provides a standard unified solution which compiles on all tools. The main\naim of development of this Generic and automatic verification environment is to\ndevelop an efficient and unified verification environment (at IP/Subsystem/SoC\nLevel) which reuses the already developed Verification components and also\nsequences written at IP/Subsystem level can be reused at SoC Level both with\nHost BFM and actual Core using Incisive Software Extension (ISX) and Virtual\nRegister Interface (VRI)/Verification Abstraction Layer (VAL) approaches.\nIP-XACT based tools are used for automatically configuring the environment for\nvarious imaging IPs/SoCs.",

    "publish": "2013-01-29T15:24:10Z", 
    "summary": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. In this paper, we propose a new\nlow power coding technique by decreasing the number of switching activities on\nthe buses which use transition signaling to transmit data. This approach\ndedicates the symbols with less ones to high probability data. MFLP unlike the\nmost low power encoding does not rely on spatial redundancy. Due to this\nsuperiority, MFLP is unique in power decreasing in the Network on Chip (NoC).\nNot only does this algorithm reduce the power consumption, but also it can\ncompress the data. It offers a tradeoff to designers to choose between\ncompression and power; that is, the more power consumption decrease we need,\nthe less compression we earn. This coding uses tree based infrastructure in\norder to decrease the number of ones to reduce the switching activities, and\nthe power consumption consequently. The proposed algorithm constructs the tree\nwith this contribution that code words with less ones are allocated to more\nfrequent data. The experimental results for the outside and inside of the NoC\nindicate that the proposed coding algorithm reduces the switching activity up\nto 30 and 45%, the link power consumption up to 35 and 46% and the total power\ndissipation up to 34.9 and 16% for the outside and inside of the NoC,\nrespectively.",

    "publish": "2013-03-04T15:14:24Z", 
    "summary": "Embedded systems have pervaded all walks of our life. With the increasing\nimportance of mobile embedded systems and flexible applications, considerable\nprogress in research has been made for power management. Power constraints are\nincreasingly becoming the critical component of the design specifications of\nthese systems. It helps in pre-determining the suitable hardware architecture\nfor the target application. The aim of this paper is to present a technique to\nestimate 'pre-run time' and 'power' of a software mapped onto a hardware\nsystem; guaranteeing the compliance of temporal constraints while generating a\nschedule of tasks of software. Real time systems must handle several\nindependent macro-tasks, each represented by a task graph, which includes\ncommunications and precedence constraints. We propose a novel approach for\npower estimation of embedded software using the Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG)\nor task graph model. This methodology uses an existing Hierarchical Concurrent\nFlow Graph (HCFG) technique for the power analysis of the CDFGs. We have\nevaluated our technique for energy efficient scheduling over various task graph\nbenchmarks. The results obtained prove the utility and efficacy of our proposed\napproach for power analysis of embedded software.

    "summary": "Accurate device free localization (DFL) based on received signal strength\n(RSS) measurements requires placement of radio transceivers on all sides of the\ntarget area. Accuracy degrades dramatically if sensors do not surround the\narea. However, law enforcement officers sometimes face situations where it is\nnot possible or practical to place sensors on all sides of the target room or\nbuilding. For example, for an armed subject barricaded in a motel room, police\nmay be able to place sensors in adjacent rooms, but not in front of the room,\nwhere the subject would see them. In this paper, we show that using two\nultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios, in addition to multiple RSS sensors,\nimproves the localization accuracy, particularly on the axis where no sensors\nare placed (which we call the x-axis). We introduce three methods for combining\nthe RSS and UWB data. By using UWB radios together with RSS sensors, it is\nstill possible to localize a person through walls even when the devices are\nplaced only on two sides of the target area. Including the data from the UWB\nradios can reduce the localization area of uncertainty by more than 60%.",

    "summary": "The stringent power budget of fine grained power managed digital integrated\ncircuits have driven chip designers to optimize power at the cost of area and\ndelay, which were the traditional cost criteria for circuit optimization. The\nemerging scenario motivates us to revisit the classical operator scheduling\nproblem under the availability of DVFS enabled functional units that can\ntrade-off cycles with power. We study the design space defined due to this\ntrade-off and present a branch-and-bound(B/B) algorithm to explore this state\nspace and report the pareto-optimal front with respect to area and power. The\nscheduling also aims at maximum resource sharing and is able to attain\nsufficient area and power gains for complex benchmarks when timing constraints\nare relaxed by sufficient amount. Experimental results show that the algorithm\nthat operates without any user constraint(area/power) is able to solve the\nproblem for most available benchmarks, and the use of power budget or area\nbudget constraints leads to significant performance gain.",

As a result of enhanced civilization and modernization, the\nhuman nature demands more comfort to his life. The man seeks ways to do things\neasily and which saves time. So thus, the automatic gates are one of the\nexamples that human nature invent to bring comfort and ease in its daily life.\nTo this end, we model and design an automatic sliding door with a room light\ncontrol system to provide the mentioned needs. This was achieved by considering\nsome factors such as economy, availability of components and research\nmaterials, efficiency, compatibility and portability and also durability in the\ndesign process. The performance of the system after test met design\nspecifications. This system works on the principle of breaking an infrared beam\nof light, sensed by a photodiode. It consists of two transmitting infrared\ndiodes and two receiving photo-diodes. The first one is for someone coming in\nand the second one is for someone going out of the room. The photodiodes are\nconnected to comparators, which give a lower output when the beam is broken and\nhigh output when transmitting normally. The general operation of the work and\nperformance is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the\ndoor and how close he/she is in closer to the door. The door is meant to open\nautomatically but in a case where there is no power supply trying to force the\ndoor open would damage the mechanical control system of the unit.

Both strategies rely on\nphysical-layer abstraction tools for predicting the link performance. We will\nshow that, in both cases, it is possible to increase the average spectral\nefficiency while at the same time keeping the outage probability under a given\nthreshold. To do so, the forward link strategy will rely on introducing some\nlatency in the data stream by using retransmissions.

    "summary": "In the multicore era, the time to computational results is increasingly\ndetermined by how quickly operands are accessed by cores, rather than by the\nspeed of computation per operand. From high-performance computing (HPC) to\nmobile application processors, low multicore utilization rates result from the\nslowness of accessing off-chip operands, i.e. the memory wall.

    "summary": "In this work author applies well known web search algorithm Hyperlink -\nInduced Topic Search (HITS) to problem of ranking football teams in English\nPremier League (EPL). The algorithm allows the ranking of the teams using the\nnotions of hubs and authorities well known for ranking pages in the World Wide\nWeb. Results of the games introduced as a graph where losing team 'gives a\nlink' to a winning team and, if draw registered both team give links to each\nother. In case of a win link is weighted as three points in adjacent matrix and\nin case of draw as one point. Author uses notion of authority in order to\ndefine team which win a game and hub as a team which lose a game, the winner of\nthe competition defined as the 'worst' hub, team that didn't reinforced any\nother team. Using this ranking system, the champion's team, which is a 'worst\nhub' must not lose, or draw games to other 'good authorities' teams. If by the\nend of the competition there are teams with an equal number of wins and losses\nthen the team which has beaten more teams with higher authority ranks, wins.",

    "summary": "Paper cutting is a simple process of slicing large rolls of paper,\njumbo-reels, into various sub-rolls with variable widths based on demands risen\nby customers. Since the variability is high due to collected various orders\ninto a pool, the process turns to be production scheduling problem, which\nrequires optimisation so as to minimise the final remaining amount of paper\nwasted. The problem holds characteristics similar one-dimensional bin-packing\nproblem to some extends and differs with some respects. This paper introduces a\nmodelling attempt as a scheduling problem with an integer programming approach\nfor optimisation purposes. Then, a constructive heuristic algorithm revising\none of well-known approaches, called Best-fit algorithm, is introduced to solve\nthe problem. The illustrative examples provided shows the near optimum solution\nprovided with very low complexity .",

    "summary": "In this paper, we presented the design and development of a new integrated\ndevice for measuring heart rate using fingertip to improve estimating the heart\nrate. As heart related diseases are increasing day by day, the need for an\naccurate and affordable heart rate measuring device or heart monitor is\nessential to ensure quality of health. However, most heart rate measuring tools\nand environments are expensive and do not follow ergonomics. Our proposed Heart\nRate Measuring (HRM) device is economical and user friendly and uses optical\ntechnology to detect the flow of blood through index finger. Three phases are\nused to detect pulses on the fingertip that include pulse detection, signal\nextraction, and pulse amplification. Qualitative and quantitative performance\nevaluation of the device on real signals shows accuracy in heart rate\nestimation, even under intense of physical activity. We compared the\nperformance of HRM device with Electrocardiogram reports and manual pulse\nmeasurement of heartbeat of 90 human subjects of different ages. The results\nshowed that the error rate of the device is negligible.",

    "summary": "The normal operation of power system relies on accurate state estimation that\nfaithfully reflects the physical aspects of the electrical power grids.\nHowever, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection\nattacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state\nestimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending\nmechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state\nestimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data\ninjection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We\ncharacterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables\nwith minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a\ngraph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and\nreduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the\nproposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces\ncomputational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation\ncompared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the\nproposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system\ntestcases.",

    "summary": "Digital Rights Management (DRM) prevents end-users from using content in a\nmanner inconsistent with its creator's wishes. The license describing these\nuse-conditions typically accompanies the content as its metadata. A resulting\nproblem is that the license and the content can get separated and lose track of\neach other. The best metadata have two distinct qualities--they are created\nautomatically without user intervention, and they are embedded within the data\nthat they describe. If licenses are also created and transported this way, data\nwill always have licenses, and the licenses will be readily examinable. When\ntwo or more datasets are combined, a new dataset, and with it a new license,\nare created. This new license is a function of the licenses of the component\ndatasets and any additional conditions that the person combining the datasets\nmight want to impose. Following the notion of a data-purpose algebra, we model\nthis phenomenon by interpreting the transfer and conjunction of data as\ninducing an algebraic operation on the corresponding licenses. When a dataset\npasses from one source to the next its license is transformed in a\ndeterministic way, and similarly when datasets are combined the associated\nlicenses are combined in a non-trivial algebraic manner. Modern,\ncomputer-savvy, licensing regimes such as Creative Commons allow writing the\nlicense in a special kind of language called Creative Commons Rights Expression\nLanguage (ccREL). ccREL allows creating and embedding the license using RDFa\nutilizing XHTML.

The paper shows that improved surveillance\ntechnologies can yield 4% to 6% reduction of aircraft on taxiway, and therefore\nemissions, in addition to the savings currently observed by implementing\nthreshold starategies under evaluation at Boston Logan Airport and other busy\nairports during congested periods. These calculated benefits contrast sharply\nwith our previous work, which relied on simplified airport ramp areas with a\nsingle departure spot, and where fewer environmental and economic benefits of\nadvanced surface surveillance systems could be established. Our work is\nillustrated by its application to New-York LaGuardia and Seattle Tacoma\nairports.",

    "title": "Impact of Gate Assignment on Gate-Holding Departure Control Strategies", 
    "publish": "2013-06-14T15:35:49Z", 
    "summary": "Gate holding reduces congestion by reducing the number of aircraft present on\nthe airport surface at any time, while not starving the runway. Because some\ndeparting flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving\nflights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared.\nThis is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that\nminimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time\ngap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment\nrobust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to\nsimulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The\nmodel is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia\nAirport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport\ndeparture process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment\nto assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The\nresults show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate\nconflicts caused by gate holding compared to the current gate assignment.\nTherefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure\ncontrol to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate\nresources.",

Four proposals are presented to customize the roughening approach.\nSimulations are presented showing that the roughening approach can benefit the\nparticle PHD filter, especially when the sample size is small.",

    "summary": "Nowadays, high-speed machining is usually used for production of hardened\nmaterial parts with complex shapes such as dies and molds. In such parts, tool\npaths generated for bottom machining feature with the conventional parallel\nplane strategy induced many feed rate reductions, especially when boundaries of\nthe feature have a lot of curvatures and are not parallel. Several machining\nexperiments on hardened material lead to the conclusion that a tool path\nimplying stable cutting conditions might guarantee a better part surface\nintegrity. To ensure this stability, the shape machined must be decomposed when\nconventional strategies are not suitable. In this paper, an experimental\napproach based on high-speed performance simulation is conducted on a master\nbottom machining feature in order to highlight the influence of the curvatures\ntowards a suitable decomposition of machining area. The decomposition is\nachieved through the construction of intermediate curves between the closed\nboundaries of the feature. These intermediate curves are used as guidance curve\nfor the tool paths generation with an alternative machining strategy called\n\"guidance curve strategy\". For the construction of intermediate curves, key\nparameters reflecting the influence of their proximity with each closed\nboundary and the influence of the curvatures of this latter are introduced.\nBased on the results, a method for defining guidance curves in four steps is\nproposed.",

    "publish": "2013-07-11T08:48:13Z", 
    "summary": "Historically, VLSI designers have focused on increasing the speed and\nreducing the area of digital systems. However, the evolution of portable\nsystems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought\npower dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces\ncooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.\nMoreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power\ndissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since\ndynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,\nlowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold\nvoltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case\nof static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e\nwhen there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC\npower and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without\ndisturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore\nit leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in\nshort channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library\nfor the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device\ndimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to\nobtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and\ntransistor threshold. In this paper CMOS Cell library has been implemented\nusing TSMC (0.18um) and TSMC (90nm) technology using HEP2 tool of IC designing\nfrom Mentor Graphics for various analysis and simulations.",

    "publish": "2013-11-05T12:12:30Z", 
    "summary": "In this paper, we present a methodology and a tool to derive simple but yet\naccurate stochastic Markov processes for the description of the energy\nscavenged by outdoor solar sources. In particular, we target photovoltaic\npanels with small form factors, as those exploited by embedded communication\ndevices such as wireless sensor nodes or, concerning modern cellular system\ntechnology, by small-cells. Our models are especially useful for the\ntheoretical investigation and the simulation of energetically self-sufficient\ncommunication systems including these devices. The Markov models that we derive\nin this paper are obtained from extensive solar radiation databases, that are\nwidely available online. Basically, from hourly radiance patterns, we derive\nthe corresponding amount of energy (current and voltage) that is accumulated\nover time, and we finally use it to represent the scavenged energy in terms of\nits relevant statistics. Toward this end, two clustering approaches for the raw\nradiance data are described and the resulting Markov models are compared\nagainst the empirical distributions. Our results indicate that Markov models\nwith just two states provide a rough characterization of the real data traces.\nWhile these could be sufficiently accurate for certain applications, slightly\nincreasing the number of states to, e.g., eight, allows the representation of\nthe real energy inflow process with an excellent level of accuracy in terms of\nfirst and second order statistics. Our tool has been developed using Matlab(TM)\nand is available under the GPL license at[1].",

    "summary": "We show that no existing continuous-time, binary value-domain model for\ndigital circuits is able to correctly capture glitch propagation. Prominent\nexamples of such models are based on pure delay channels (P), inertial delay\nchannels (I), or the elaborate PID channels proposed by Bellido-D\\'iaz et al.\nWe accomplish our goal by considering the solvability/non-solvability border of\na simple problem called Short-Pulse Filtration (SPF), which is closely related\nto arbitration and synchronization. On one hand, we prove that SPF is solvable\nin bounded time in any such model that provides channels with non-constant\ndelay, like I and PID. This is in opposition to the impossibility of solving\nbounded SPF in real (physical) circuit models. On the other hand, for binary\ncircuit models with constant-delay channels, we prove that SPF cannot be solved\neven in unbounded time; again in opposition to physical circuit models.\nConsequently, indeed none of the binary value-domain models proposed so far\n(and that we are aware of) faithfully captures glitch propagation of real\ncircuits. We finally show that these modeling mismatches do not hold for the\nweaker eventual SPF problem.",

    "summary": "A mashup is a combination of information from more than one source, mixed up\nin a way to create something new, or at least useful. Anyone can find mashups\non the internet, but these are always specifically designed for a predefined\npurpose. To change that fact, we implemented a new platform we called the SMART\nplatform. SMART enables the user to make his own choices as for the REST web\nservices he needs to call in order to build an intelligent personalized mashup,\nfrom a Google-like simple search interface, without needing any programming\nskills. In order to achieve this goal, we defined an ontology that can hold\nREST web services descriptions. These descriptions encapsulate mainly, the\ninput type needed for a service, its output type, and the kind of relation that\nties the input to the output. Then, by matching the user input query keywords,\nwith the REST web services definitions in our ontology, we can find registered\nservices individuals in this ontology, and construct the raw REST query for\neach service found. The wrap up from the keywords, into semantic definitions,\nin order to find the matching service individual, then the wrap down from the\nsemantic service description of the found individual, to the raw REST call, and\nfinally the wrap up of the result again into semantic individuals, is done for\ntwo main purposes: the first to let the user use simple keywords in order to\nbuild complex mashups, and the second to benefit from the ontology inference\nengine in a way, where services instances can be tied together into an\nintelligent mashup, simply by making each service output individuals, stand as\nthe next service input.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a cross wavelet transform based method for\nElectrocardiogram signal analysis where parameters are identified from wavelet\ncross spectrum and wavelet cross coherence of ECG patterns. Most of the ECG\nanalysing systems use explicit time plane features for cardiac pattern\nclassification. Application of this proposed technique for classification\neliminates the need for extraction of various explicit time plane features and\nhence reduces the complexity of the system. The cross-correlation is the\nmeasure of similarity between two waveforms or two time series and the cross\nexamination reveals localized similarities in time and scale. Parameters\nextracted from Wavelet Cross Spectrum (WCS) and Wavelet Coherence (WCOH) is\nused for classification. A pathologically varying pattern in QT zone of\ninferior lead III shows the presence of Inferior Myocardial Infarction (IMI).\nThe Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence is used for the cross\nexamination of single normal and abnormal (IMI) beats. A normal template beat\nis selected as the absolute normal pattern. Computation of the WCS and WCOH of\nthe selected normal template and various other normal and abnormal beats\nreveals the existence of variation among patterns under study. The Wavelet\ncross spectrum and Wavelet coherence of various ECG patterns shows\ndistinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is\nthe QRS complex location and R2 is the T wave region. Parameters are identified\nfor classification of Type 1 IMI (non Q type, with ST elevation and attenuated\nQRS complex) and Type 2 IMI (Q type MI with deep Q and inverted T) and normal\nsubjects. Accuracy of the proposed classification method is obtained as 99.43%\nfor normal and abnormal class and 88.5% and 87.02% for Type I and Type II\nrespectively.",

In this\ncontext, distributed generators (DGs) are exploited to achieve other objectives\nbeyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power losses along the\ndistribution lines. The aim of this work is that of designing a full-fledged\nsystem that extends existing state of the art algorithms for the distributed\nminimization of power losses. We take into account practical aspects such as\nthe design of a communication and coordination protocol that is resilient to\nlink failures and manages channel access, message delivery and DG coordination.\nThus, we analyze the performance of the resulting optimization and\ncommunication scheme in terms of power loss reduction, reduction of aggregate\npower demand, convergence rate and resilience to communication link failures.\nAfter that, we discuss the results of a thorough simulation campaign, obtained\nusing topologies generated through a statistical approach that has been\nvalidated in previous research, by also assessing the performance deviation\nwith respect to localized schemes, where the DGs are operated independently.\nOur results reveal that the convergence and stability performance of the\nselected algorithms vary greatly. However, configurations exist for which\nconvergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just\n30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved. Also,\nsome of the considered approaches are quite robust against link failures as\nthey still provide gains with respect to the localized solutions for failure\nrates as high as 50%.",

Its basic\nprinciple is to detect the changes in the statistics of some radio quality\nmeasurements in order to infer the presence of people and objects in the radio\npath. However, the localisation accuracy of RTI suffers from complicated radio\npropagation behaviours such as multipath fading and shadowing. In order to\nimprove RTI localisation accuracy, we propose to use inexpensive and energy\nefficient electronically switched directional (ESD) antennas to improve the\nquality of radio link behaviour observations, and therefore, the localisation\naccuracy of RTI. We implement a directional RTI (dRTI) system to understand how\ndirectional antennas can be used to improve RTI localisation accuracy. We also\nstudy the impact of the choice of antenna directions on the localisation\naccuracy of dRTI and propose methods to effectively choose informative antenna\ndirections to improve localisation accuracy while reducing overhead.

The Andrienko framework\nis intended to be applicable to all types of data, however, it does not\nconsider relational (graph) data. We therefore extended both their data model\nand task framework for temporal graph data, and instantiated the extended\nversion to produce a comprehensive list of tasks of interest during exploratory\nanalysis of temporal graph data. As expected, our instantiation of the\nframework resulted in a very large task list; with more than 144 variations of\nattribute based tasks alone, it is too large to fit in a standard journal\npaper, hence we provide the detailed listing in this document.",

    "summary": "Spatial interactions between agents (humans, animals, or machines) carry\ninformation of high value to human or electronic observers. However, not all\nthe information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and\nthus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises.\nThe Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising\ndevelopment towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in\nthe past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction\ndomains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with\nlateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion;\ntherefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring\nbetween flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in\nthis paper QTC3Dis presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can\ndeal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on\ntransformations of the Frenet-Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of\nthe moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition\nand properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an\napplication of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is\nnow extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct\nyet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.",

In fact, the penalty can be driven to\nzero with sufficiently large First In First Outs and the removal of\nmultiple-loop communication links. We present an example mesh-connected Generic\nArray Logic chip multiprocessor and show it has a less than 1% performance\n(throughput) reduction on average compared to the corresponding synchronous\nsystem for many DSP workloads.

    "summary": "The indoor radio propagation channel is typically modeled as a two-state\ntime-variant process where one of the states represents the channel when the\nenvironment is static, whereas the other state characterizes the medium when it\nis altered by people. In this paper, the aforementioned process is augmented\nwith an additional state. It is shown that the changes in received signal\nstrength are dictated by: i) electronic noise, when a person is not present in\nthe monitored area; ii) reflection, when a person is moving in the close\nvicinity of the line-of-sight; iii) shadowing, when a person is obstructing the\nline-of-sight component of the transmitter-receiver pair. Statistical and\nspatial models for the three states are derived and the models are empirically\nvalidated. Based on the models, a simplistic device-free localization\napplication is designed which aims to: first, estimate the temporal state of\nthe channel using a hidden Markov model; second, track a person using a\nparticle filter. The results suggest that the tracking accuracy is enhanced by\nat least 65% while the link's sensitivity region is increased by 100% or more\nwith respect to empirical models presented in earlier works.",

Yet, few of them pay attention to\ndefining urban areas with micro data in a fine-scaled manner with large extend\nscale by incorporating the morphological and functional characteristics. This\npaper investigates an automated framework to delineate urban areas in the\nparcel level, using increasingly available ordnance surveys for generating all\nparcels (or geo-units) and ubiquitous points of interest (POIs) for inferring\ndensity of each parcel. A vector cellular automata model was adopted for\nidentifying urban parcels from all generated parcels, taking into account\ndensity, neighborhood condition, and other spatial variables of each parcel. We\napplied this approach for mapping urban areas of all 654 Chinese cities and\ncompared them with those interpreted from mid-resolution remote sensing images\nand inferred by population density and road intersections.

    "summary": "Storing digital information, ensuring the accuracy, steady and uninterrupted\naccess to the data are considered as fundamental challenges in enterprise-class\norganizations and companies. In recent years, new types of storage systems such\nas solid state disks (SSD) have been introduced. Unlike hard disks that have\nmechanical structure, SSDs are based on flash memory and thus have electronic\nstructure. Generally a SSD consists of a number of flash memory chips, some\nbuffers of the volatile memory type, and an embedded microprocessor, which have\nbeen interconnected by a port. This microprocessor run a small file system\nwhich called flash translation layer (FTL). This software controls and\nschedules buffers, data transfers and all flash memory tasks. SSDs have some\nadvantages over hard disks such as high speed, low energy consumption, lower\nheat and noise, resistance against damage, and smaller size. Besides, some\ndisadvantages such as limited endurance and high price are still challenging.\nIn this study, the effort is to combine two common technologies - SLC and MLC\nchips - used in the manufacture of SSDs in a single SSD to decrease the side\neffects of current SSDs. The idea of using multi-layer SSD is regarded as an\nefficient solution in this field.",

To obtain a potential\ndiagnosis from a raw MCC/IMS measurement, several computational steps are\nnecessary, which so far have required manual interaction, e.g., human\nevaluation of discovered peaks. We have recently proposed an automated pipeline\nfor this task that does not require human intervention during the analysis.\nNevertheless, there is a need for improved methods for each computational step.\nIn comparison to gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data, MCC/IMS\ndata is easier and less expensive to obtain, but peaks are more diffuse and\nthere is a higher noise level. MCC/IMS measurements can be described as samples\nof mixture models (i.e., of convex combinations) of two-dimensional probability\ndistributions.

Although\nthe AMMEM filter is a variety of the maximum-minimum exclusive mean (MMEM)\nfilter, however, the AMMEM filter inherits the advantages, and overcomes the\ndrawbacks, compared with the MMEM filter. To increase the various performances\nof noise removal, the AMMEM filter uses an adaptive size window, introduces two\nflexible factors, projection factor P and detection factor T, and limits the\ncalculation scope of the AVG. The experimental results show the AMMEM filter\nmakes a significant improvement in terms of noise detection, image restoration,\nand computational efficiency.

Our technique uses integer\nlinear programming, with an energy cost model to select a good set of basic\nblocks to place into RAM, without impacting stack or data storage.\n  We evaluate our optimization on a common ARM microcontroller and succeed in\nreducing the average power consumption by up to 41% and reducing energy\nconsumption by up to 22%, while increasing execution time. A case study is\npresented, where an application executes code then sleeps for a period of time.\nFor this example we show that our optimization could allow the application to\nrun on battery for up to 32% longer.

    "summary": "Modern digital circuit design relies on fast digital timing simulation tools\nand, hence, on accurate binary-valued circuit models that faithfully model\nsignal propagation, even throughout a complex design. Unfortunately, it was\nrecently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued\ncircuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and\ninertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple\nShort-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability\nto suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded\nsingle-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded\ntime or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer\nfrom this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution\nchannels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output\ntransition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based\non involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example\nof such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order\nanalog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We\nprove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history\nchannels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a\nlower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide\nan unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit\nmodels based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is\npossible in physical circuits. To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence\nthe very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch\npropagation.",

For improving the reliability, a routing algorithm to achieve maximum\nperformance under fault is proposed. Finally, in the architecture level, we\npropose two new NoC structures using bi-directional links for the performance\noptimization. In particular, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance\nthe network-on-chip(NoC) performance utilizing bidirectional channels. We also\npropose a flexible NoC architecture which takes advantage of a dynamic\ndistributed routing algorithm and improves the NoC communication performance\nwith moderate energy overhead. From the simulation results on both synthetic\ntraffic and real workload traces, significant performance improvement in terms\nof latency and throughput can be achieved.",

    "summary": "Tic-Tac-Toe game can be played by two players where the square block (3 x 3)\ncan be filled with a cross (X) or a circle (O). The game will toggle between\nthe players by giving the chance for each player to mark their move. When one\nof the players make a combination of 3 same markers in a horizontal, vertical\nor diagonal line the program will display which player has won, whether X or O.\nIn this paper, we implement a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game in LabVIEW. The game is\ndesigned so that two players can play tic-tac-toe using LabVIEW software. The\nprogram will contain a display function and a select function to place the\nsymbol as well as toggle between the symbols allowing each player a turn to\nplay the game. The program will update after each player makes their move and\ncheck for the conditions of game as it goes on. Overall program works without\nany bugs and is able to use",

We addresse several case\nstudies to illustrate the progress of research and utilization on big models,\nincluding mapping urban areas for all Chinese cities, performing parcel-level\nurban simulation, and several ongoing research projects. Most of these\napplications can be adopted across the country, and all of them are focusing on\na fine-scale level, such as a parcel, a block, or a township (sub-district),\nwhich is not the same with the existing studies using conventional models that\nare only suitable for a certain single or two cities or regions, or for a\nlarger area but have to significantly sacrifice the data resolution.

To this end, this paper proposes\nMetamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M$^2$I) communication mechanism,\nwhere a MI coil antenna is enclosed by a metamaterial shell that can enhance\nthe magnetic fields around the MI transceivers. As a result, the M$^2$I\ncommunication system can achieve tens of meters communication range by using\npocket-sized antennas. In this paper, an analytical channel model is developed\nto explore the fundamentals of the M$^2$I mechanism, in the aspects of\ncommunication range and channel capacity, and the susceptibility to various\nhostile and complex environments.

Unfortunately, prior analysis methods for validating timing correctness\nin embedded systems become quite pessimistic when suspension delays are\npresent. In this paper, we consider the problem of supporting two common types\nof I/O applications in a multiprocessor system, that is, write-only\napplications and read-write applications. For the write-only application model,\nwe present a much improved analysis technique that results in only O(m)\nsuspension-related utilization loss, where m is the number of processors. For\nthe second application model, we present a flexible I/O placement strategy and\na corresponding new scheduling algorithm, which can completely circumvent the\nnegative impact due to read- and write-induced suspension delays. We illustrate\nthe feasibility of the proposed I/O-placement-based schedule via a case study\nimplementation.

    "summary": "As the complexity of the scan algorithm is dependent on the number of design\nregisters, large SoC scan designs can no longer be verified in RTL simulation\nunless partitioned into smaller sub-blocks. This paper proposes a methodology\nto decrease scan-chain verification time utilizing SCE-MI, a widely used\ncommunication protocol for emulation, and an FPGA-based emulation platform. A\nhigh-level (SystemC) testbench and FPGA synthesizable hardware transactor\nmodels are developed for the scan-chain ISCAS89 S400 benchmark circuit for\nhigh-speed communication between the host CPU workstation and the FPGA\nemulator. The emulation results are compared to other verification\nmethodologies (RTL Simulation, Simulation Acceleration, and Transaction-based\nemulation), and found to be 82% faster than regular RTL simulation. In\naddition, the emulation runs in the MHz speed range, allowing the incorporation\nof software applications, drivers, and operating systems, as opposed to the Hz\nrange in RTL simulation or sub-megahertz range as accomplished in\ntransaction-based emulation. In addition, the integration of scan testing and\nacceleration/emulation platforms allows more complex DFT methods to be\ndeveloped and tested on a large scale system, decreasing the time to market for\nproducts.",

    "summary": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, aims to\ndisaggregate a household's electricity consumption into constituent appliances.\nMore than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of\nseveral novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two\ncore challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances\nand ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These\nchallenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of\nappliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches\nhave attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high\nsampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number\nof sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an\ninexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use\nthe reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in\nPLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for\nan appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on\ntype and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC\nmodems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.",

We develop a novel hybrid maximum likelihood (HML)\nclassification scheme based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM)\nalgorithm. GEM is capable of finding ML estimates numerically that are\nextremely hard to obtain otherwise. Assuming a good initialization technique is\navailable for GEM, we show that the classification performance can be greatly\nimproved with multiple sensors compared to that with a single sensor,\nespecially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. We further demonstrate\nthe superior performance of our approach when simulated annealing (SA) with\nuniform as well as nonuniform grids is employed for initialization of GEM in\nlow SNR regions. The proposed GEM based approach employs only a small number of\nsamples (in the order of hundreds) at a given sensor node to perform both time\nand phase synchronization, signal power estimation, followed by modulation\nclassification.

One of the major challenges associated with wireless\nsensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection\nof segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on\ndetecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and\nsensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools\ncapable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and\nunusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE\nDetector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless\nsensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic\ninferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently\nsearch across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify,\nretrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the\ndata streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the\nimplementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system.\nSecondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations\ncollected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in\nQueensland, Australia. The experimental results show that the SOUE-Detector can\nefficiently detect segment outliers and unusual events with high levels of\nprecision and recall.",

A positive capacitive feedback (PCF) around the second\nstage introduces a left half plane (LHP) zero which cancels the phase shift\nintroduced by the non-dominant pole, considerably. The dominant pole is at the\noutput node which means that increasing the load capacitance has minimal effect\non stability. Moreover, a simple and effective method is proposed to enhance\nslew rate.

    "title": "STC: Coarse-Grained Vehicular Data Based Travel Speed Sensing by   Leveraging Spatial-Temporal Correlation", 
    "publish": "2015-04-17T03:40:39Z", 
    "summary": "As an important information for traffic condition evaluation, trip planning,\ntransportation management, etc., average travel speed for a road means the\naverage speed of vehicles travelling through this road in a given time\nduration. Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data\nalways depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are\ntherefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an\ninfrastructure-free way, can be used to collect data including real-time\nlocations and velocities of vehicles for road travel speed estimation, which is\na quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always\ncoarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel\nspeeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed\naccurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the\nspatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the\ntime-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the\ntime consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly\ncalculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time\nlagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at\ndifferent roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation,\nwe further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to\na minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for\nroads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate\nexperiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the\nincompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed\nestimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in\ncomparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.",

    "summary": "In recent years there has been an increasing use of embedded systems because\nof advances in technology, the reduction of the costs of electronic equipment\nand mainly the popularity of mobile devices. Many of these systems implement\nlow power consumption policies to extend their autonomy, usually because they\nhave a reduced amount of resources and the great majority of them use electric\npower from batteries. One way to minimize the power consumption of these\ndevices is through of the application of low power consumption techniques. From\nthe various techniques presented in the literature - the intra-task Dynamic\nVoltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) has played an important role. The main aim\nof DVFS is to allow each task to manage the minimum resources necessary for\ntasks execution, this way reducing the processor power consumption and, at the\nsame time, respecting the task deadlines when considered a real-time system\ncontext. Therefore, this paper aims to apply a systematic literature review\nwith the goal of identifying and presenting the main methods using the\nintra-task DVFS technique, applied in the context of real-time systems to\nreduce energy consumption on the processor. Finally, this work will show the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each cataloged methodology.",

A typical blog may consist of texts, images, audios and\nvideos etc. Most of the blogs work as personal online diaries, while others may\nfocus on specific interest such as photographs (photoblog), art (artblog),\ntravel (tourblog), IT (techblog) etc. Another type of blogging called\nmicroblogging is also very well known now-a-days which contains very short\nposts. Like the developed countries, the users of blogs are gradually\nincreasing in the developing countries e.g. Bangladesh. Due to the nature of\nopen access to all users, some people misuse it to spread fake news to achieve\nindividual or political goals. Some of them also post vulgar materials that\nmake an embarrass situation for other bloggers. Even, sometimes it indulges the\nreputation of the victim. The only way to overcome this problem is to bring all\nthe posts under supervision of the blog moderator. But it totally contradicts\nwith blogging concepts. In this paper, we have implemented an algorithm that\nwould help to prevent the offensive entries from being posted. These entries\nwould go through a supervision process to justify themselves as legal posts.\nFrom the analysis of the result, we have shown that this approach can eliminate\nthe chaotic situations in blogosphere at a great extent.

The basic mathematical tool used for\nemotion recognition is Pattern recognition which involves three operations,\nnamely, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. This paper\nintroduces a procedure for emotion recognition using Hidden Markov Models\n(HMM), which is used to divide five emotional states: anger, surprise,\nhappiness, sadness and neutral state. The approach is based on standard speech\nrecognition technology using hidden continuous markov model by selection of low\nlevel features and the design of the recognition system. Emotional Speech\nDatabase from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed\nusing several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states. The accuracy of\nrecognizing five different emotions for both genders of classification is 80%\nfor anger-emotion which is achieved by using the best combination of\n39-dimensioanl feature vector for every frame (13 MFCCs, 13 Delta Coefficients\nand 13 Acceleration Coefficients) and a classifier using HMM.

    "summary": "We study the problem of scheduling periodic real-time tasks so as to meet\ntheir individual minimum reward requirements. A task generates jobs that can be\ngiven arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains\nrewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this\nmodel is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing\nreward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these\nmodels, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim\nto fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers\nbetter fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward\nrequirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility\noptimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy\nto be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition\ncan serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains\na greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility\noptimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation\nbound for the policy under general cases.",

    "publish": "2012-08-07T15:00:27Z", 
    "summary": "E-health innovations support empowered customers. It offers the ability for\ncustomers to have greater control and ready access applications of health\ninformation, clinical information, and social interaction between interested\ngroups. However, providing empowerment in any state of interaction levels to\ncustomers (patients) in a healthcare organization is challenging tasks.\nCustomers are empowered in the sense of controlling the process of interaction\nbetween a firm with its customers, and among customers themselves. This paper\ndiscusses dimension of customers' empowerment in e-health business process. We\npropose reference model of Personal Health Cycle (PHC) as a holistic view of\nhealthcare business process. The PHC is used to define and distinct electronic\nhealth record (EHR) from electronic medical record (EMR) and customers\nempowerment.",

    "summary": "Introduction of Smart phones redefined the usage of mobile phones in the\ncommunication world. Smart phones are equipped with various sophisticated\nfeatures such as Wi-Fi, GPS navigation, high resolution camera, touch screen\nwith broadband access which helps the mobile phone users to keep in touch with\nthe modern world. Many of these features are primarily integrated with the\nmobile operating system which is out of reach to public, by which the users\ncan't manipulate those features. Google came up with an innovative operation\nsystem termed as ANDROID, which is open system architecture with customizable\nthird party development and debugging environment which helps the user's to\nmanipulate the features and to create their own customizable applications. In\nthis paper, 'Emergency Based Remote Collateral Tracking System' application\nusing Google's Android Mobile Platform is addressed. Emergency is divided into\nthree categories: heart beat based emergency, security threats like personal\nsafety and road accidents. This application is targeted to a person who is\ndriving a vehicle. Heart rate monitoring device is integrated with our\napplication to sense the heart beat of a person driving the vehicle and if\nthere is any abnormalities in the heart beat, then our application performs a\ndual role. One in which, application uses a GPS to track the location\ninformation of the user and send those location information as a message via\nSMS, email and post it on Facebook wall Simultaneously, an emergency signal is\nsent to Arduino Microcontroller.This application is written in JAVA programming\nlanguage which runs on Eclipse Integrated Development Kit.",

    "title": "Adding Methodological Testing to Naur's Anti-formalism", 
    "publish": "2012-08-18T10:58:40Z", 
    "summary": "Peter Naur is the leading critic of formalist computing because of his\nextensive writings that disprove the now dominate characterization of human\nthought as cognitive information processing. Naur criticizes the ideological\nposition that only discourse that adopts computer inspired forms are\nacceptable. Lakatosian philosophy of the methodology of scientific research\nprogrammes (MSRP) is added to Naur's studies to allow testing of computing\ntheories. After discussing Naur's criticism of mechanical cognitive information\nprocessing, I show how to add MSRP competition to Naur's descriptive\nphilosophy. Next, Naur's claim that computing can not become scientific until\norganizational issues involving ideological suppression of discussions of\ncomputing and human thinking are solved is corroborated by institutional\nsuppression of my 1970s attempts to criticize structured programming (SP).\n  Various problems in computing related philosophy are discussed. First, I\nargue that my MSRP based degenerating research programme disproof of SP is\nbetter than Naur's programming as a human activity, Demillo's social processes\nand Fetzer's unprovable causal nature. Three areas for post ideologically based\ncomputing study are discussed: computing as a path to rediscovering 19th\ncentury conceptions of infinity, axiom of choice testing facilitated by\ncomputing and relation to physical theory, and testing concrete complexity\nmethods based on efficiency proof analysis.",

    "summary": "The World Wide Web is a popular and interactive medium to distribute\ninformation in this scenario. The web is huge, diverse, ever changing, widely\ndisseminated global information service center. We are familiar with terms like\ne-commerce, e-governance, e-market, e-finance, e-learning, e-banking etc. for\nan organization it is new challenge to maintain direct contact with customers\nbecause of the rapid growth in e-commerce, e-publishing and electronic service\ndelivery. To deal with this there is need of intelligent marketing strategies\nand CRM (customer relationship management) i.e. the effective way of\nintegrating enterprise applications in real time. Web mining is the vast field\nthat helps to understand various concepts of different fields. Web usage mining\ntechniques are attempted to reason about different materialized issues of\nBusiness Intelligence which include marketing expertise as domain knowledge and\nare specifically designed for electronic commerce purposes. To this end, the\nchapter provides an introduction to the field of Web mining and examines\nexisting as well as potential Web mining applications applicable for different\nbusiness function, like marketing, human resources, and fiscal administration.\nSuggestions for improving information technology infrastructure are made, which\ncan help businesses interested in Web mining hit the ground running.",

    "summary": "A mechanism for the reduction of dynamic energy dissipation in the computing\ncircuit is described. The resonant circuit with controlled switches conserves\nthe stored energy by recovering upto 90% of energy that would be otherwise lost\nduring logic state transitions. This energy-conserving approach preserves\nthermodynamic entropy, ideally preventing heat generation in the system. This\napproach is used in a proposed resonant clocking and logic application without\ndynamic energy dissipation.",

    "publish": "2012-09-12T16:08:18Z", 
    "summary": "This is an opinion paper regarding a proposal of a model for a Ecosystemm\nGovernance. In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS)\nand Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the\nrequirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the\nrapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making.\nWhereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has\nbeen used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation\nof knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and\ndisseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control,\nanalysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the\nunderstanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage\nglobal corporations and provide customers with products and services of value.\nIn this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an\necosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the\ncustomer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its\ndistribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or\nsometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part\nof day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business\nneeds, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources,\nwhich makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the\nSociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the\nmodel proposed regarding an ecosystem. Finally, whereas the summary above, the\nmain objective of this opinion paper is to propose the guidelines for a\nSociotechnical Management Model of Governance for an Ecosystem.",
