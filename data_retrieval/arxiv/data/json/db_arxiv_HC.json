    "summary": "The electronic presentation of text in small display windows is mushrooming.\nIn the present paper, four ways of presenting text in a small display window\nwere examined and compared to a Normal Page condition: rapid serial visual\npresentation (RSVP), RSVP with a Completion Meter, Sentence-by-Sentence\npresentation, and Sentence-by-Sentence presentation with a Completion Meter.\nDependent measures were reading efficiency - speed and comprehension - and\npreference. For designers of hardware or software with small display windows,\nthe results suggest the following: (1) Though RSVP is disliked by readers, the\npresent methods of allowing self-pacing and regressions in RSVP, unlike earlier\ntested methods, are efficient and feasible. (2) Slower reading in RSVP should\nbe achieved by increasing pauses between sentences or by repeating sentences,\nnot by decreasing the within-sentence rate. (3) Completion meters do not\ninterfere with performance, and are usually preferred. (4) The space-saving\nSentence-by-Sentence format is as efficient and as preferred as the Normal Page\nformat."

    "summary": "Training in motor skills such as athletics, dance, or gymnastics is not\npossible today except in the direct presence of the coach/instructor. This\npaper describes a computer vision based gesture recognition system which is\nused to metamorphose the user into a Virtual person, e.g. as a Kathakali\ndancer, which is graphically recreated at a near or diatant location. Thus this\ncan be seen by an off-site coach using low-bandwidth joint-motion data which\npermits real time animation. The metamorphosis involves altering the appearance\nand identity of the user and also creating a specific environment possibly in\ninteraction with other virtual creatures.\n  A robust vision module is used to identify the user, based on very simple\nbinary image processing in real time which also manages to resolve\nself-occlusion, correct for clothing/colour and other variations among users.\nGestures are identified by locating key points at the shoulder, elbow and wrist\njoint, which are then recreated in an articulated humanoid model, which in this\ninstance, representes a Kathakali dancer in elaborate traditional dress. Unlike\nglove based or other and movement tracking systems, this application requires\nthe user to wear no hardwire devices and is aimed at making gesture tracking\nsimpler, cheaper, and more user friendly."

Second, how these price equilibria might\ninvolve price dispersion on-line. Third, why prices may be higher on-line.\nFourth, why established firms can, but need not, be more reluctant than newly\ncreated firm to adopt e-commerce. For this purpose we develop a model where\ne-commerce reduces consumers' search costs, involves trade-offs for consumers,\nand reduces retailing costs."

We discuss potential benefits of conversation analysis\nfor design, and we describe our strategies for integrating the conversation\nanalyst in the design process. Since the analyst on our team had no previous\nexposure to design or engineering, and none of the other members of our team\nhad any experience with conversation analysis, we needed to build a foundation\nfor our interaction. One of our key strategies was to pair the conversation\nanalyst with a designer in a highly interactive collaboration. Our tactics have\nbeen effective on our project, leading to valuable results that we believe we\ncould not have obtained using another method. We hope that this paper can serve\nas a practical guide to those interested in establishing a productive and\nefficient working relationship between a conversation analyst and the other\nmembers of a design team."

    "summary": "Web pages contain a large variety of information, but are largely designed\nfor use by graphical web browsers. Mobile access to web-based information often\nrequires presenting HTML web pages using channels that are limited in their\ngraphical capabilities such as small-screens or audio-only interfaces. Content\ntranscoding and annotations have been explored as methods for intelligently\npresenting HTML documents. Much of this work has focused on transcoding for\nsmall-screen devices such as are found on PDAs and cell phones. Here, we focus\non the use of annotations and transcoding for presenting HTML content through a\nvoice user interface instantiated in VoiceXML. This transcoded voice interface\nis designed with an assumption that it will not be used for extended web\nbrowsing by voice, but rather to quickly gain directed access to information on\nweb pages. We have found repeated structures that are common in the\npresentation of data on web pages that are well suited for voice presentation\nand navigation. In this paper, we describe these structures and their use in an\nannotation system we have implemented that produces a VoiceXML interface to\ninformation originally embedded in HTML documents. We describe the transcoding\nprocess used to translate HTML into VoiceXML, including transcoding features we\nhave designed to lead to highly usable VoiceXML code."

The interaction is kept the same\nfor all devices, and different presentation information is provided for\ndifferent devices. This way, tailored user interfaces for many different\ndevices can be created without multiplying development and maintenance work.

Drawing on\nobservational research on the use of existing communication technology, we\nargue (as have others in the past) that determination of availability is often\na joint process, and often one that takes the form of a negotiation (whether\nimplicit or explicit). We briefly describe our current research on applying\nmachine learning to infer degrees of conversational engagement from observed\nconversational behavior.

    "summary": "As computers become more ubiquitous, traditional two-dimensional interfaces\nmust be replaced with interfaces based on a three-dimensional metaphor.\nHowever, these interfaces must still be as simple and functional as their\ntwo-dimensional predecessors. This paper introduces SWiM, a new interface for\nmoving application windows between various screens, such as wall displays,\nlaptop monitors, and desktop displays, in a three-dimensional physical\nenvironment. SWiM was designed based on the results of initial \"paper and\npencil\" user tests of three possible interfaces. The results of these tests led\nto a map-like interface where users select the destination display for their\napplication from various icons. If the destination is a mobile display it is\nnot displayed on the map. Instead users can select the screen's name from a\nlist of all possible destination displays. User testing of SWiM was conducted\nto discover whether it is easy to learn and use. Users that were asked to use\nSWiM without any instructions found the interface as intuitive to use as users\nwho were given a demonstration. The results show that SWiM combines simplicity\nand functionality to create an interface that is easy to learn and easy to use."

    "summary": "Pervasive personal communication technologies offer the potential for\nimportant social benefits for individual users, but also the potential for\nsignificant social difficulties and costs. In research on face-to-face social\ninteraction, ambiguity is often identified as an important resource for\nresolving social difficulties. In this paper, we discuss two design cases of\npersonal communication systems, one based on fieldwork of a commercial system\nand another based on an unrealized design concept. The cases illustrate how\nuser behavior concerning a particular social difficulty, unexplained\nunresponsiveness, can be influenced by technological issues that result in\ninteractional ambiguity. The cases also highlight the need to balance the\nutility of ambiguity against the utility of usability and communicative\nclarity."

This\npaper proposes a philosophy of input method design by seeing it as a\nnonintrusive plug-in text service framework. Such design allows new\nfunctionalities of text processing to be attached onto a running application\nwithout any tweaking of code. We also introduce OpenVanilla, a cross-platform\nframework that is designed with the above-mentioned model in mind. Frameworks\nlike OpenVanilla have shown that an input method can be more than just a text\nentry tool: it offers a convenient way for developing various text service and\nlanguage tools."

The two-dimensional area of the\ntouchpad is subdivided into 5 virtual sliders, each controlling the intensity\nof a color (red, green, blue, yellow, and white). The physical interaction\nmethodology is modeled directly after ubiquitous mechanical sliders and dimmers\nwhich tend to be used for intensity/volume control. Our abstraction to a\npressure-sensitive touchpad provides advantages and introduces additional\nbenefits over such existing devices."

We report here on an\napplied conversation analytic study of small-group sociable talk, emphasizing\nstructural and temporal aspects that can inform computational models. In\nparticular, we examine the mechanics of multiple simultaneous conversational\nfloors - how participants initiate a new floor amidst an on-going floor, and\nhow they subsequently show their affiliation with one floor over another.

    "summary": "This paper presents a state-of-art review of empirical research on\nobject-oriented (OO) design. Many claims about the cognitive benefits of the OO\nparadigm have been made by its advocates. These claims concern the ease of\ndesigning and reusing software at the individual level as well as the benefits\nof this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature,\nits seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of\nthe main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO\ndesign are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical\nstudies of OOD. We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the\nbasis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO\ndesigners, (2) compare OO design with procedural design and, (3) discuss a\ntypology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims\nabout naturalness and ease of OO design. The next part discusses results on OO\nsoftware reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO\nversus procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and\n(3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on\nreusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OO design by teams. We\npresent results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and\ninteractions with clients. Then we assess claims about OOD at the software\ndesign team level. In a general conclusion, we discuss the limitations of these\nstudies and give some directions for future research."

    "summary": "The goal of our study is to evaluate the effect on program comprehension of\nthree factors that have not previously been studied in a single experiment.\nThese factors are programmer expertise (expert vs. novice), programming task\n(documentation vs. reuse), and the development of understanding over time\n(phase 1 vs. phase 2). This study is carried out in the context of the mental\nmodel approach to comprehension based on van Dijk and Kintsch's model (1983).\nOne key aspect of this model is the distinction between two kinds of\nrepresentation the reader might construct from a text: 1) the textbase, which\nrefers to what is said in the text and how it is said, and 2) the situation\nmodel, which represents the situation referred to by the text. We have\nevaluated the effect of the three factors mentioned above on the development of\nboth the textbase (or program model) and the situation model in object-oriented\nprogram comprehension. We found a four-way interaction of expertise, phase,\ntask and type of model. For the documentation group we found that experts and\nnovices differ in the elaboration of their situation model but not their\nprogram model. There was no interaction of expertise with phase and type of\nmodel in the documentation group. For the reuse group, there was a three-way\ninteraction between phase, expertise and type of model. For the novice reuse\ngroup, the effect of the phase was to increase the construction of the\nsituation model but not the program model. With respect to the task, our\nresults show that novices do not spontaneously construct a strong situation\nmodel but are able to do so if the task demands it."

This paper presents an approach based on protocol analysis\nfor quantifying the influence of participant roles during PRMs. Three views are\nused to characterize the seven defined participant roles. The project view\ndefines three roles supervisor, procedure expert and developer. The meeting\nview defines two roles: author and reviewer, and the task view defines the\nroles reflecting direct and indirect interest in the artifact under review. The\nanalysis, based on log-linear modeling, shows that review activities have\ndifferent patterns, depending on their focus: form or content. The influence of\neach role is analyzed with respect to this focus. Interpretation of the\nquantitative data leads to the suggestion that PRMs could be improved by\ncreating three different types of reviews, each of which collects together\nspecific roles: form review, cognitive synchronization review and content\nreview."

Eight professional programmers\nexperienced with procedural programming languages and either experienced or not\nexperienced in object-oriented design strategies related to two central aspects\nof the object-oriented paradigm: (1) associating actions, i.e., execution\nsteps, of a complex plan to different objects and revising a complex plan, and\n(2) defining simple plans at different levels in the class hierarchy. As\nregards the development of complex plans elements attached to different\nobjects, our results show that, for beginners in OOP, the description of\nobjects and the description of actions are not always integrated in an early\ndesign phase, particularly for the declarative problem whereas, for the\nprogrammers experienced in OOP, the description of objects and the description\nof actions tend to be integrated in their first drafts of solutions whichever\nthe problem type. The analysis of design strategies reveal the use of different\nknowledge according to subjects' language experience: (1) schemas related to\nprocedural languages; actions are organized in an execution order, or (2)\nschemas related to object-oriented languages; actions and objects are\nintegrated, and actions are organised around objects."

    "summary": "The objective of this research is to analyse the ways members of open-source\nsoftware communities participate in design. In particular we focus on how users\nof an Open Source (OS) programming language (Python) participate in adding new\nfunctionalities to the language. Indeed, in the OS communities, users are\nhighly skilled in computer sciences; they do not correspond to the common\nrepresentation of end-users and can potentially participate to the design\nprocess. Our study characterizes the Python galaxy and analyses a formal\nprocess to introduce new functionalities to the language called Python\nEnhancement Proposal (PEP) from the idea of language evolution to the PEP\nimplementation. The analysis of a particular pushed-by-users PEP from one\napplication domain community (financial), shows: that the design process is\ndistributed and specialized between online and physical interactions spaces;\nand there are some cross participants between users and developers communities\nwhich may reveal boundary spanners roles."

Design involves the use of generic knowledge as well as episodic\nknowledge about past designs for analogous problems : in this way, it involves\nthe reuse of past designs. We analyse this mechanism of reuse from a\nsocio-cognitive viewpoint. According to a purely cognitive approach, reuse\ninvolves cognitive mechanisms linked to the problem solving activity itself.\nOur socio-cognitive approach accounts for these phenomena as well as reuse\nmechanisms linked to cooperation, in particular coordination, and\nconfrontation/integration of viewpoints."

One key\naspect of this theoretical approach is the distinction between two kinds of\nrepresentation the reader might construct from a text: the textbase and the\nsituation model. On the basis of results of an experiment we have conducted, we\nevaluate the cognitive validity of this distinction in OO program\nunderstanding.

Empirical studies on design with reuse and\non software documenting provide evidence for a generalized cognitive model.\nFirst, these studies emphasize the cyclical nature of design: cycles of\nplanning, writing and revising occur. Second, natural language documentation\nfollows the hierarchy of cognitive entities manipulated during design.\nSimilarly software reuse involves exploiting various types of knowledge\ndepending on the phase of design in which reuse is involved. We suggest that\nthese observations can be explained based on cognitive models of text\nprocessing: the van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) model of text comprehension, and\nthe Hayes and Flower (1980) model of text production. Based on our generalized\ncognitive model, we suggest a framework for documenting reusable components."

    "summary": "Today, people use multiple devices to fulfill their information needs.\nHowever, designers design each device individually, without accounting for the\nother devices that users may also use. In many cases, the applications on all\nthese devices are designed to be functional replicates of each other. We argue\nthat this results in an over-reliance on data synchronization across devices,\nversion control nightmares, and increased burden of file management. In this\npaper, we present the idea of a \\textit{personal information ecosystem}, an\nanalogy to biological ecosystems, which allows us to discuss the\ninter-relationships among these devices to fulfill the information needs of the\nuser. There is a need for designers to design devices as part of a complete\necosystem, not as independent devices that simply share data replicated across\nthem. To help us understand this domain and to facilitate the dialogue and\nstudy of such systems, we present the terminology, classifications of the\ninterdependencies among different devices, and resulting implications for\ndesign."

This approach has been developed by a\nmultidisciplinary team made up of software engineers and cognitive\npsychologists. The basis of this approach is to improve our understanding of\nsoftware development by observing professionals at work. The goal is to derive\nlines of conduct or good practices based on observations and analyses of the\nprocesses that are naturally used by software engineers. The strategy involved\nis derived from a standard approach in cognitive science. It is based on the\nvideotaping of the activities of software engineers, transcription of the\nvideos, coding of the transcription, defining categories from the coded\nepisodes and defining cognitive behaviors or dialogs from the categories. This\nproject presents two original contributions that make this approach generic in\nsoftware engineering. The first contribution is the introduction of a formal\nhierarchical coding scheme, which will enable comparison of various types of\nobservations. The second is the merging of psychological and statistical\nanalysis approaches to build a cognitive model. The details of this new\napproach are illustrated with the initial data obtained from the analysis of\ntechnical review meetings."

We examine the effect of expertise in three dimensions of\ncomprehension strategies: the scope of the comprehension, the top-down versus\nbottom-up direction of the processes, and the guidance of the comprehension\nactivity. Overall, subjects were similar in the scope of their comprehension,\nalthough the experts tended to consult more files. We found strong evidence of\ntop-down, inference-driven behaviors, as well as multiple guidance in expert\ncomprehension. We also found evidence of execution-based guidance and less use\nof top-down processes in novice comprehension. Guidance by inheritance and\ncomposition relationships in the OO program was not dominant, but nevertheless\nplayed a substantial role in expert program comprehension. However, these\nstatic relationships more closely tied to the OO nature of the program were\nexploited poorly by novices. To conclude, these results are discussed with\nrespect to the literature on procedural program comprehension."

We conducted cognitive ergonomics research work during the definition\nphase of an aeronautical design project in which the participants work in\nConcurrent Engineering. We recorded, retranscribed and analysed 7\nmulti-speciality meetings. These meetings were organised, as needed, to assess\nthe integration of the solutions of each speciality into a global solution. We\nfound that there are three main design proposal assessment modes which can be\ncombined in these meetings: (a) analytical assessment mode, (b) comparative\nassessment mode (c) analogical assessment mode.

    "summary": "Open Source Software (OSS) development challenges traditional software\nengineering practices. In particular, OSS projects are managed by a large\nnumber of volunteers, working freely on the tasks they choose to undertake. OSS\nprojects also rarely rely on explicit system-level design, or on project plans\nor schedules. Moreover, OSS developers work in arbitrary locations and\ncollaborate almost exclusively over the Internet, using simple tools such as\nemail and software code tracking databases (e.g. CVS). All the characteristics\nabove make OSS development akin to weaving a tapestry of heterogeneous\ncomponents. The OSS design process relies on various types of actors: people\nwith prescribed roles, but also elements coming from a variety of information\nspaces (such as email and software code). The objective of our research is to\nunderstand the specific hybrid weaving accomplished by the actors of this\ndistributed, collective design process. This, in turn, challenges traditional\nmethodologies used to understand distributed software engineering: OSS\ndevelopment is simply too \"fibrous\" to lend itself well to analysis under a\nsingle methodological lens. In this paper, we describe the methodological\nframework we articulated to analyze collaborative design in the Open Source\nworld. Our framework focuses on the links between the heterogeneous components\nof a project's hybrid network. We combine ethnography, text mining, and\nsocio-technical network analysis and visualization to understand OSS\ndevelopment in its totality. This way, we are able to simultaneously consider\nthe social, technical, and cognitive aspects of OSS development. We describe\nour methodology in detail, and discuss its implications for future research on\ndistributed collective practices."

But in some cases, this view is not easy to use on a braille\ndevice. In such cases, it would be much more useful to let applications provide\ntheir own braille feedback, specially adapted to visually impaired users. Such\napplications would then need the ability to output braille ; however, allowing\nboth screen readers and applications access a wide panel of braille devices is\nnot a trivial task. We present an abstraction layer that applications may use\nto communicate with braille devices. They do not need to deal with the\nspecificities of each device, but can do so if necessary.

    "summary": "Tremendous research effort was invested in audio browsers and machine\nlearning techniques to decode the structure of Web pages in order to put them\ninto an audio format. In this paper, we address a simpler and efficient\nsolution for the creation of an audio browser of VOICEXML generated from\nRSS/Atom stream feeds. We developed a multimodal (audio and graphical) portal\napplication that offers RSS/Atom feeds. By utilizing sing our system, the user\ncan interact using voice or graphic commands, listen and watch digital content,\nsuch as news, blogs feeds, podcasts, and even access email and personal\nschedules. The portal system permits the use of security credentials\n(user/password authentication) to collect secure RSS/Atom stream in the\nmultimodal browser to connect the user to specific personal services. A series\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RSS reader\nand navigator. Our system is extremely beneficial for a wide range of\napplications, from interfaces for the visual impaired users to browsers for\nmobile telephonic interfaces."

    "summary": "The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware\ncapabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets\nbecome available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not\nsatisfactorily answer the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global\nstructure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities.\nTo address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for\nnetworks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations:\nnode-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while\narbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better\nsupport the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction\ntechniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging\nselections from either a node-link or a matrix, flexibly manipulate the\nNodeTrix representation to explore the dataset, and create meaningful summary\nvisualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying\nNodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate\nthe capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means\nof communicating results."

    "summary": "The new requirement for \"collaboration\" between multidisciplinary\ncollaborators induces to exchange and share adequate information on the\nproduct, processes throughout the products' lifecycle. Thus, effective capture\nof information, and also its extraction, recording, exchange, sharing, and\nreuse become increasingly critical. These lead companies to adopt new improved\nmethodologies in managing the exchange and sharing of information. The aim of\nthis paper is to describe a collaborative framework system to exchange and\nshare information, which is based on: (i) The Product Process Collaboration\nOrganization model (PPCO) which defines product and process information, and\nthe various collaboration methods for the organizations involved in the supply\nchain. (ii) Viewpoint model describes relationships between each actor and the\ncomprehensive Product/Process model, defining each actor's \"domain of interest\"\nwithin the evolving product definition. (iii) A layer which defines the\ncomprehensive organization and collaboration relationships between the actors\nwithin the supply chain. (iv) Based on the above relationships, the last layer\nproposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on\nXML, is developed that supports optimal exchange/sharing of information. To\nillustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to\ncollaborative design of a new piston for an automotive engine. The focus is on\nuser-viewpoint integration to ensure that the adequate information is retrieved\nfrom the PPCO."

    "summary": "Nowadays, to achieve competitive advantage, the industrial companies are\nconsidering that success is sustained to great product development. That is to\nmanage the product throughout its entire lifecycle. Achieving this goal\nrequires a tight collaboration between actors from a wide variety of domains,\nusing different software tools producing various product data types and\nformats. The actors' collaboration is mainly based on the exchange /share\nproduct information. The representation of the actors' viewpoints is the\nunderlying requirement of the collaborative product development. The multiple\nviewpoints approach was designed to provide an organizational framework\nfollowing the actors' perspectives in the collaboration, and their\nrelationships. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple\nintegration of product information as different views, promotes gathering of\nactors' interest, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing\nsupport for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a\nmultiple viewpoints representation is proposed. The product, process,\norganization information models are discussed. A series of issues referring to\nthe viewpoints representation are discussed in detail. Based on XML standard,\ntaking electrical connector as an example, an application case of part of\nproduct information modeling is stated."

The paper first presents this representation, then\ndescribes an empirical study (17 participants) aimed at assessing the utility\nand usability of each view. Subjective judgements in questionnaires and\ndebriefings were varied: 7 participants preferred the IV view, 4 the OV one,\nand 6 could not choose between the two.

An experimental study was\ncarried out to determine whether oral messages including coarse information on\nthe locations of graphical objects on the current display may facilitate target\ndetection tasks sufficiently for making it worth while to integrate such\nmessages in GUIs. The display spatial layout varied in order to test the\ninfluence of visual presentation structure on the contribution of these\nmessages to facilitating visual search on crowded displays. Finally, three\nlevels of task difficulty were defined, based mainly on the target visual\ncomplexity and the number of distractors in the scene. The findings suggest\nthat spatial information messages improve participants' visual search\nperformances significantly; they are more appropriate to radial structures than\nto matrix, random and elleptic structures; and, they are particularly useful\nfor performing difficult visual search tasks."

    "summary": "It has been reported that virtual reality can be a useful tool for ergonomics\nstudy. The proposed integrated simulation system aims at measuring operator's\nperformance in an interactive way for 2D control panel design. By incorporating\nsome sophisticated virtual reality hardware/software, the system allows natural\nhuman-system and/or human-human interaction in a simulated virtual environment;\nenables dynamic objective measurement of human performance; and evaluates the\nquality of the system design in human factors perspective based on the\nmeasurement. It can also be for operation training for some 2D control panels."

Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that\nappropriate verbal messages can improve both target selection time and\naccuracy.

    "summary": "Input multimodality combining speech and hand gestures has motivated numerous\nusability studies. Contrastingly, issues relating to the design and ergonomic\nevaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual\nmodalities have not yet been addressed extensively. The experimental study\npresented here addresses one of these issues. Its aim is to assess the actual\nefficiency and usability of oral system messages including brief spatial\ninformation for helping users to locate objects on crowded displays rapidly.\nTarget presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were\nchosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target\npresentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode\n(MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks\n(120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation\nmode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors.\nMultimodal target presentation proved to be more efficient than visual target\npresentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on\nmultimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by\na majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to\nvisual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and\ntask difficulty: (i) messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for\n2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of\n2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing; (ii) message\nusefulness increased with task difficulty. Most of these results are\nstatistically significant."

We add a branch to this model, divided into three\ncomponents: Data capture, analysis and cue extraction, and finally\ninterpretation of those cues. We show the different data flows between this\narchitecture's components depending on the entry point of the emotion branch\nwithin the system. We then illustrate our model by describing our application\ncase: capturing a ballet dancer's movement to extract the emotions he expresses\nand use these emotions to generate graphical content that is displayed on\nstage."

Data\ncollection was based on observations (by the cognitive ergonomics researcher)\nand simultaneous verbalisations (by the designers) in empirical studies\nconducted in the context of industrial design projects. The contribution of\nthis research is typical of cognitive ergonomics, in that it provides data on\nactual activities implemented by designers in their actual work situation\n(rather than on prescribed and/or idealised processes and methods). Data\npresented concern global strategies (the way in which designers actually\norganise their activity) and local strategies (reuse in design). Results from\ncognitive ergonomics and other research that challenges the way in which people\nare supposed to work with existing systems are generally not received warmly.\nAbundant corroboration of such results is required before industry may consider\ntaking them into account. The opportunistic organisation of design activity is\ntaken here as an example of this reluctance. The results concerning this aspect\nof design have been verified repeatedly, but only prototypes and experimental\nsystems implementing some of the requirements formulated on their basis, are\nunder development."

    "summary": "This article presents a cognitively oriented viewpoint on design. It focuses\non cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive\nactivity implemented by designers during their work on professional design\nprojects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's\nsymbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or\nsome other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we\nconsider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately\ncharacterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion\nof the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This\npresentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels\nof abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external\nrepresentations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.\nDesigning is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its\nstrategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different\nways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a\n\"generic design\" stance, we claim that design can take different forms\ndepending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for\ndimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.\nWe discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive\ndesign research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of\nrepresentational structures and activities by an outline of some directions\nregarding their functional linkages."

    "summary": "Nowadays, more and more surgical interventions are carried out in Minimally\nInvasive Surgery, to make the post-operative constraints less painful for the\npatient. Actually, new surgical tools or medical products are designed after\ninformal discussions between surgeons and designers. The user requirements\ndocuments are the main document used by the mechanical designers to design and\nimprove the product. Medical terms, often used by surgeons and employed to\nexplain their needs, don't allow for an instantaneous understanding by\ndesigners. Unfortunately, this relation causes a dysfunction in the definition\ncycle of the product. Our aim is to work on the design process, its assistance\nthanks to methods and tools and on its organisation for better understandings\nand more complementarities between surgeons and designers. We propose on this\narticle a design method already tested in the informatics domain: User Centred\nDesign which takes the user into account more effectively in the process\ndesign. We already propose a scenario oriented design method centred on the\nuser and represented as a scenario (Scenario-Based Design). We start in this\narticle by clarifying these concepts before detailing their implementation for\nthe design of a new surgical tool."

In this paper, we describe a\nco-operative design case study where we analyse some annotation practices,\nmainly focused on design minutes recorded during project reviews. We point out\nspecific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,\nwe propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to\nsupport communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of\nannotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary\nannotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a\nset of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing\nexpress/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory\ndebates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,\nand we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design\ncontext, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.\nAfter the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse\nannotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section\nis dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and\ndefine the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic\nannotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based\non our approach."

    "summary": "All of the countries within Africa experience a serious shortage of medical\nprofessionals, particularly specialists, a problem that is only exacerbated by\nhigh emigration of doctors with better prospects overseas. As a result, those\nthat remain in Africa, particularly those practicing in rural regions,\nexperience a shortage of specialists and other colleagues with whom to exchange\nideas. Telemedicine and teleconsultation are key areas that attempt to address\nthis problem by leveraging remote expertise for local problems. This paper\npresents an overview of teleconsultation in the developing world, with a\nparticular focus on how lessons learned apply to Africa. By teleconsultation,\nwe are addressing non-real-time communication between health care professionals\nfor the purposes of providing expertise and informal recommendations, without\nthe real-time, interactive requirements typical of diagnosis and patient care,\nwhich is impractical for the vast majority of existing medical practices. From\nthese previous experiences, we draw a set of guidelines and examine their\nrelevance to Ghana in particular. Based on 6 weeks of needs assessment, we\nidentify key variables that guide our framework, and then illustrate how our\nframework is used to inform the iterative design of a prototype system."

The underlying rationale for this paper is that\nspreadsheet training courses should specifically address risk management in the\ndevelopment process both from a generic and a domain-specific viewpoint. This\nresearch specifically focuses on one of these namely those generic issues of\nrisk management that should be present in a training course that attempts to\nmeet good-practice within industry. A pilot questionnaire was constructed\nshowing a possible minimum set of risk management issues and sent to academics\nand industry practitioners for feedback. The findings from this pilot survey\nwill be used to refine the questionnaire for sending to a larger body of\npossible respondents. It is expected these findings will form the basis of a\nrisk management teaching approach to be trialled in a number of selected\nongoing spreadsheet training courses."

We\npresent a paradigm for organizing and interpreting spreadsheet engineering\nrecommendations. It systematically addresses the myriad choices made when\ndeveloping a spreadsheet, and explicitly considers resource constraints and\nother development parameters. This paradigm provides a framework for\nevaluation, comparison, and selection of methodologies, and a list of essential\nelements for developers or codifiers of new methodologies. This paradigm\nidentifies gaps in our knowledge that merit further research."

Logical areas, semantic classes and\ndata modules are abstract representations of spreadsheet programs that are\nmeant to reduce the auditing and comprehension effort, especially for large and\nregular spreadsheets. The toolkit is integrated as a plug-in in the Gnumeric\nspreadsheet system for Linux. It can process large, industry scale spreadsheet\nprograms in reasonable time and is tightly integrated with its host spreadsheet\nsystem. Users can generate hierarchical and graph-based representations of\ntheir spreadsheets. This allows them to spot conceptual similarities in\ndifferent regions of the spreadsheet, that would otherwise not fit on a screen.\nAs it is assumed that the learning effort for effective use of such a tool\nshould be kept low, we aim for intuitive handling of most of the tool's\nfunctions."

    "summary": "This paper extends a spreadsheet visualization technique by using layout\ninformation. The original approach identifies logically or semantically related\ncells by relying exclusively on the content of cells for identifying semantic\nclasses. A disadvantage of semantic classes is that users have to supply\nparameters which describe the possible shapes of these blocks. The correct\nparametrization requires a certain degree of experience and is thus not\nsuitable for untrained users. To avoid this constraint, the approach reported\nin this paper uses row/column-labels as well as common format information for\nlocating areas with common, recurring semantics. Heuristics are provided to\ndistinguish between cell groups with intended common semantics and cell groups\nrelated in an ad-hoc manner."

However, due to\nthe very nature of spreadsheets, their evolution is particularly tricky and\ntherefore error-prone. In our strive to develop tools and methodologies to\nimprove spreadsheet quality, we analysed consolidation spreadsheets of an\ninternationally operating company for the errors they contain. The paper\npresents the results of the field audit, involving 78 spreadsheets with 60,446\nnon-empty cells. As a by-product, the study performed was also to validate our\nanalysis tools in an industrial context. The evaluated auditing tool offers the\nauditor a new view on the formula structure of the spreadsheet by grouping\nsimilar formulas into equivalence classes. Our auditing approach defines three\nsimilarity criteria between formulae, namely copy, logical and structural\nequivalence. To improve the visualization of large spreadsheets, equivalences\nand data dependencies are displayed in separated windows that are interlinked\nwith the spreadsheet. The auditing approach helps to find irregularities in the\ngeometrical pattern of similar formulas."

A disparity exists in\nthe business world between the importance of spreadsheets on financial data\n(created by A&F Professionals) and the resources devoted to: The development\nand oversight of global spreadsheet standards; A recognized and accredited\ncertification in spreadsheet proficiency; Corporate sponsored and required\ntraining; Awareness of emerging technologies as it relates to spreadsheet use.\nThis management paper focuses on the current topics relevant to the largest\nuser group (A&F Professionals) of the most widely used financial software\napplication, spreadsheets, also known as the accountant's hammer."

    "summary": "The DidaTab project (Didactics of Spreadsheet, teaching and learning\nspreadsheets) is a three year project (2005-2007) funded by the French Ministry\nof Research and dedicated to the study of personal and classroom uses of\nspreadsheets in the French context, focussing on the processes of appropriation\nand uses by secondary school students. In this paper, we present an overview of\nthe project, briefly report the studies performed in the framework of the\nDidaTab project, and give the main results we obtained. We then explore the new\nresearch tracks we intend to develop, more in connection with EuSpRIG. Our main\nresult is that the use of spreadsheet during secondary education (grade 6 to\n12) is rather sparse for school work (and even more seldom at home) and that\nstudent competencies are weak. Curricula have to be reviewed to include more\ntraining of dynamics tabular tools (including databases queries) in order to\nensure sufficient mastery of computer tools that have became necessary in many\neducational activities."

    "summary": "Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a\nfair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve\nreadability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when\nthey are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to\nunderstand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance.\n  As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was\nconducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of\ncrossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance.\nSixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six\ndrawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra\neye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have\nlittle impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a\npath between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the\npath go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view\nto further confirmation in future work."

We propose a probabilistic framework that models evolution of\nuser satisfaction, on top of his/her continuous frustration at not finding the\nrequired information. It is found that the cumulative satisfaction profile of a\nweb-searching individual can be modeled effectively as the sum of random number\nof random terms, where each term is mutually independent random variable,\noriginating from 'memoryless' Poisson flow. Evolution of satisfaction over the\nentire time interval of user's browsing was modeled with auto-correlation\nanalysis. A utilitarian marker, magnitude of greater than unity of which\ndescribe happy web-searching operations; and an empirical limit that connects\nuser's satisfaction with his frustration level - are proposed too. Presence of\npertinent information in the very first page of a web-site and magnitude of the\ndecay parameter of user satisfaction (frustration, irritation etc.), are found\nto be two key aspects that dominate web-browser's psychology. The proposed\nmodel employed different combination of decay parameter, searching time and\nnumber of helpful web-sites. Obtained results are found to match the results\nfrom three real-life case-studies."

    "summary": "The old Bulgarian keyboard standard BDS 5237-78 was developed for use mostly\non typewriter machines. The wide distribution of the computers forced the\nupdate of this standard. On one hand this is because of the need to support\nsymbols such as the Bulgarian quotation marks, the Cyrillic letter I with grave\naccent, the long dash, etc. On the other hand the so called \"phonetic layout\"\nbecame popular and this layout is not standartized by BDS. In this work we are\nanalyzing the possibilities to improve the keyboard layout according to BDS\n5237-78, as well as the traditional phonetic layout. At the same time we are\nmaking a comparison with the new proposed Bulgarian keyboard layout standard\nBDS 5237:2006. We are proposing an algorithm for placement of additional\nsymbols on the keys of the keyboard in a way that makes easy for the users to\nfind the symbols even when they are not inscripted on the keys. We are giving\nformal definitions and illustrations of four keyboard layouts - three extended\nkeyboard layouts for typing in \"Cyrillic\" mode (BDS, traditional phonetic and\nphonetic according to the new proposed BDS 5237:2006) and one extended layout\nfor typing in \"Latin\" mode."

    "summary": "Very little has been explored about the narrative as a process when\nconstructing entertainment for interactive media. Simultaneously, the interest\nin narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations, seeing the narrative\nas a structure, obscure the examination of the process of selecting, arranging\nand rendering story material. To correct this deficiency, a method for a\nnarrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring\nnarration as a process, is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties\nof the interactive media. This method focuses on the initial phase where\nestablishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation\nthat precedes its systematization and computation. The aim is to give designers\na comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with\ncreativity, and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between\nnarration, spatiality and interactivity. The method aided the practise of a\ndiscipline that was established through a qualitative study conducted as part\nof a university course in rapid prototyping. The results demonstrated that the\nmethod aided time-constrained design processes, simultaneously detecting\ninconsistencies that would prevent the team from making improvements. The\nmethod gave the team a shared vocabulary and outlook, allowing them to progress\nwithout interfering with the creative flow. This enabled the team to reason\nabout the process and easily advice design stakeholders. The study also\nprovides directions for future developments within research of narrative\nprocesses in game design."

Moreover, from the remaining 52 subjects, only 6 (8%) were\nconfident enough to make prompt comparisons between items and an immediate\npurchasing choice, while 17 respondents (22%) expressed the need for being away\nfrom persuasive elements. The remaining 29 respondents (38%) reported having a\nsuboptimal strategy for making their shopping decisions (i.e. buying all items,\nnot buying, or choosing randomly). Therefore, the majority of our participants\n(70% = 32% + 38%) had social and information needs when making purchasing\ndecisions. This result motivates the development of applications that would\nallow consumers to ask shopping questions to their social network while\non-the-go."

The\nlong-term objective is to formulate specifications for remote\ncollaborative-design systems, especially for supporting the use of different\nsemiotic modalities (multi-modal interaction). According to their function for\ndesign, interaction, and collaboration, we distinguish different gesture\nfamilies: representational (entity designating or specifying), organisational\n(management of discourse, interaction, or functional design actions),\nfocalising, discourse and interaction modulating, and disambiguating gestures.\nDiscussion and conclusion concern the following points. It is impossible to\nattribute fixed functions to particular gesture forms. \"Designating\" gestures\nmay also have a design function. The gestures identified in A1 possess a\ncertain generic character. The gestures identified are neither systematically\nirreplaceable, nor optional accessories to speech or drawing. We discuss the\npossibilities for gesture in computer-supported collaborative software systems.\nThe paper closes on our contribution to gesture studies and cognitive design\nresearch."

The proposed solution includes a framework in\nwhich the applications can plug into, to get their application commands and\ncorresponding tags in to the new command execution application.We also propose\na mechanism where user can generate her own set of tags for a command and share\nthose with peers."

    "summary": "This article presents the Cogni-CISMeF project, which aims at improving the\nhealth information search engine CISMeF, by including a conversational agent\nthat interacts with the user in natural language. To study the cognitive\nprocesses involved during information search, a bottom-up methodology was\nadopted. An experiment has been set up to obtain human dialogs related to such\nsearches. The analysis of these dialogs underlines the establishment of a\ncommon ground and accommodation effects to the user. A model of artificial\nagent is proposed, that guides the user by proposing examples, assistance and\nchoices."

    "summary": "A location and tracking system becomes very important to our future world of\npervasive computing. An algorithm for accurate location information is being\nincorporated in the human walking model and in the blind human walking model.\nWe want to implement an accurate location tracking mechanism using Zigbee along\nwith GPS, we have incorporated Markov chain algorithm for establishing\naccuracy. Normal Human and blind human walking steps were actually taken in the\nknown environment within our campus and the Markov chain algorithm was used for\nsmoothening the stepwise variation in location updates. A comparison module is\nalso implemented to show the difference between normal human and blind human\nwalking step variations. This accuracy is used for designing a blind tracking\ndevice so that the device can be used by the blind for finding the path without\nobstacles. We present a system level approach to localizing and tracking Human\nand blind users on a basis of different sources of location information [GPS\nplus Zigbee]. The system can be applied outdoors especially for avoiding\naccidents, GPS as the source of location data. Performance evaluation shows\nthat the system is accurate and it is a future path finding device with service\nfor the blind."

    "summary": "Context is a rich concept and is an elusive concept to define. The concept of\ncontext has been studied by philosophers, linguists, psychologists, and\nrecently by computer scientists. Within each research community the term\ncontext was interpreted in a certain way that is well-suited for their goals,\nhowever no attempt was made to define context. In many areas of research in\ncomputer science, notably on web-based services, human-computer interaction\n(HCI), ubiquitous computing applications, and context-aware systems there is a\nneed to provide a formal operational definition of context. In this brief\nsurvey an account of the early work on context, as well as the recent work on\nmany working definitions of context, context modeling, and a formalization of\ncontext are given. An attempt is made to unify the different context models\nwithin the formalization. A brief commentary on the usefulness of the\nformalization in the development of context-aware and dependable systems is\nincluded."

Study 2\ncompared the two versions of iScale to free recall, a control condition that\ndoes not influence the reconstruction process. Significant differences between\niScale and free recall were found. Overall, iScale resulted in an increase in\nthe amount, the richness, and the test-retest reliability of recalled\ninformation.

Moreover, as common\nsense knowledge varies from group to group of people, it can be used for\ndeveloping applications capable of giving different feedback for different\ntarget groups, as the applications presented along this chapter illustrate,\nallowing, in this way, interface personalization taking into account cultural\nissues. For the purpose of using common sense knowledge in the development and\ndesign of computer systems, it is necessary to provide an architecture that\nallows it. This chapter presents LIAs approaches for common sense knowledge\nacquisition, representation and use, as well as for natural language\nprocessing, contributing with those ones who intent to get into this\nchallenging world to get started."

We argue\nthat online experiments can be just as valid---both internally and\nexternally---as laboratory and field experiments, while requiring far less\nmoney and time to design and to conduct. In this paper, we first describe the\nbenefits of conducting experiments in online labor markets; we then use one\nsuch market to replicate three classic experiments and confirm their results.\nWe confirm that subjects (1) reverse decisions in response to how a\ndecision-problem is framed, (2) have pro-social preferences (value payoffs to\nothers positively), and (3) respond to priming by altering their choices. We\nalso conduct a labor supply field experiment in which we confirm that workers\nhave upward sloping labor supply curves. In addition to reporting these\nresults, we discuss the unique threats to validity in an online setting and\npropose methods for coping with these threats. We also discuss the external\nvalidity of results from online domains and explain why online results can have\nexternal validity equal to or even better than that of traditional methods,\ndepending on the research question. We conclude with our views on the potential\nrole that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then\nrecommend software development priorities and best practices."

    "summary": "The P300 speller is being considered as an independent brain-computer\ninterface. That means it measures the user's intent, and does not require the\nuser to move any muscles. In particular it should not require eye fixation of\nthe desired character. However, it has been shown that posterior electrodes\nprovide significant discriminative information, which is likely related to\nvisual processing. These findings imply the need for studies controlling the\neffect of eye movements. In experiments with a 3x3 character matrix, attention\nand eye fixation was directed to different characters. In the event-related\npotentials, a P300 occurred for the attended character, and N200 was seen for\nthe trials showing the focussed character. It occurred at posterior sites,\nreaching its peak at 200ms after stimulus onset. The results suggest that gaze\ndirection plays an important role in P300 speller paradigm. By controlling gaze\ndirection it is possible to separate voluntary and involuntary EEG responses to\nthe highlighting of characters."

    "summary": "Successful collaboration depends on effective communication. Ongoing group\nawareness facilitates communication by enabling workers to be more informed\nabout their collaborators, about their activities, and about the interpersonal\ndependencies among people working together. In this paper we present MyUnity, a\nnew system that aids workers in building group awareness. The system uses\nmultiple sources, both automatic and user-provided, to report colleagues'\nlocation, availability, current tasks, and preferred communication channels.\nInformation is aggregated, fused and presented as a simple presence state for\neach worker. Workers can each independently control what information is\ncollected by the system, allowing them to participate in the system without\ncompromising their privacy. Results from a four-week field study show MyUnity\nincreased group awareness and fostered an increased sense of community in the\nworkplace. Results provide insights into the utility of awareness systems in\nthe workplace."

    "summary": "Nowadays cell phone is the most common communicating used by mass people. SMS\nbased communication is a cheap and popular communication method. It is human\ntendency to have the opportunity to write SMS in their mother language. Text\ninput in mother language is more flexible when the alphabets of that language\nare printed on the keypad. Bangla mobile keypad based on phonetics has been\nproposed earlier. But the keypad is not scientific from frequency and\nflexibility point of view. Since it is not a feasible solution in this paper we\nhave proposed an efficient Bengali keypad for cell phone and other cellular\ndevice. The proposed keypad is based on the frequency of the alphabets in\nBengali language and also with the view of structure of human finger movements.\nWe took the two points in count to provide a flexible and fast cell phone\nkeypad."

    "summary": "The enhanced frequency based keypad is designed to speed up the typing\nprocess. This paper will show that the proposed layout will increase the typing\nspeed and be flexible for thumb. Traditional cell phone keypad is not a\nscientific keypad from the frequency point of view. Approaches have been\nexplored to speed up the typing process. We found that no manufacturer has\nconsidered the frequency of the alphabet. The current architecture does not\nprovide flexibility although the users are accustomed to the currently\navailable multi-tapping keypad. Since the currently available keypad layouts\nare not best suited for users, this paper will suggest a keypad for cell phone\nand other cellular device based on the frequency of the alphabet in English\nlanguage and also with the view of structure of human finger movements to\nprovide a flexible and fast cell phone keypad. It also takes into consideration\nthe key jamming problem that was available in typewriter. At first we\nidentified those keys of cell phone, which are easily reachable and create less\npressure on the thumb. Thus the key frequency order is calculated from\nanatomical point of view. In our proposed layout we arranged the alphabet in\nthe frequent keys based on the frequency of the alphabet."

The\nanalysis is restricted to gesticulations and emblems. The data analysed come\nfrom an empirical study conducted on an architectural design meeting. Based on\na previous analysis of the data, guided by our model of design as the\nconstruction of representations, we distinguish representational and\norganisational functions. The results of the present analysis are that, even if\nform-function association tendencies exist, gestures with a particular function\nmay take various forms, and particular gestural movements as regards form can\nfulfil different functions. Reconsidering these results and other research on\ngesture, we formulate the assumption that, if formal characteristics do not\nallow differentiating functional gestures in collaboration, context-dependent,\nsemantic characteristics may be more appropriate. We also envision the\npossibility that closer inspection of the data reveal tendencies of another\nnature."

    "summary": "A number of data acquisition systems depend on human interface to access\ncomputer for measuring, processing and analyzing data and to prepare it for\npresentation and storage. Data acquisition software is installed on the\ncomputer and all intended operations are performed manually. The data\nacquisition software requires user intervention for operations like selection\nof measurement setup, acquisition and storage of data to computer. The duty of\nusers becomes laborious if the data acquisition process lasts for a long\nduration and requires continuous repetition of steps. An appropriate solution\nto overcome such problem is to replace the physical operator with a virtual\nuser. This software generated simulated user sits at the data acquisition\nprocess through out and automate all the intended steps of data acquisition.\nThis paper presents a new approach for data acquisition by using keyboard\nemulation technique. A keyboard emulation software is developed which runs\nbeside the main data acquisition software and acts as a virtual user. All the\noperations which require user interface are performed through fully automated\ncomputer program. The developed software/system is executed in a real time\nenvironment and the functionality of the software is verified. In the end,\npotential application areas of the designed keyboard emulation software are\nexplored."

In order to test this system a pilot study\nhas been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand\nthe potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists\nwho 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional\nrehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another\nusing a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown\nthe MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation."

It is vital that these\napplications are able to adapt to the user, as a person, and to its current\nsituation, whatever that is. Therefore, the premises for evolution towards a\nlearning society and a knowledge economy are present. Hence, there is a\nstringent demand for new learner-centred frameworks that allow active\nparticipation of learners in knowledge creation within communities,\norganizations, territories and society, at large. This paper presents the\nmulti-agent architecture of our context-aware system and the learning scenarios\nwithin ubiquitous learning environments that the system provides support for.\nThis architecture is the outcome of our endeavour to develop ePH, a system for\nsharing public interest information and knowledge, which is accessible through\nalways-on, context-aware services."

    "summary": "With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home\ncare, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of\nthe household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants\n(users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive\napplications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in\ndiverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The\ncore challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess\noccurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according\nto the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive\ncomputing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right\ninformation and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a\ncontext-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most\nimportant component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level\ndescription of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the\nmodel multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.\nBased on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach\nusing CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task\nrecognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.\nMoreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is\nalso discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task\nsupporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle\nand environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results\nof the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good\nefficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity\ninference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life."

Successful\nvideo games deliver experience that impact players on a level of arousal.\nTherefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a\ngame achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional\nusability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and\ninterview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we\ncapture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate\nmicro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the\npost-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their\nfeelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret\nphysiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key\npoints in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the\nparticipant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the\nnegative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a\npositive impact on player's experience."

Though PDM is heavily benefiting industry but PDM community is facing\na very serious unresolved issue in PDM system development with flexible and\nuser friendly graphical user interface for efficient human machine\ncommunication. PDM systems offer different services and functionalities at a\ntime but the graphical user interfaces of most of the PDM systems are not\ndesigned in a way that a user (especially a new user) can easily learn and use\nthem. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in field of Human\nComputer Interaction; resultant data provides the information about graphical\nuser interface development using rich internet applications. The accomplished\ngoal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a proposition of a\nconceptual model for the implementation of a flexible web based graphical user\ninterface. The proposed conceptual model was successfully designed into\nimplementation model and a resultant prototype putting values to the field is\nnow available. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,\nimplementation designs and developed prototype is also discussed in this paper.\nMoreover in the end, prototype is compared with respective functions of\nexisting PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness\nagainst targeted challenge"

    "summary": "The location determination in obstructed area can be very challenging\nespecially if Global Positioning System are blocked. Users will find it\ndifficult to navigate directly on-site in such condition, especially indoor car\npark lot or obstructed environment. Sometimes, it needs to combine with other\nsensors and positioning methods in order to determine the location with more\nintelligent, reliable and ubiquity. By using ubiquitous positioning in mobile\nnavigation system, it is a promising ubiquitous location technique in a mobile\nphone since as it is a familiar personal electronic device for many people.\nHowever, as research on ubiquitous positioning systems goes beyond basic\nmethods there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed\nubiquitous positioning systems. System developers are also lacking of good\nframeworks for understanding different options during building ubiquitous\npositioning systems. This paper proposes taxonomy to address both of these\nproblems. The proposed taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of\npapers and articles on positioning estimation that can be used to determine\nlocation everywhere on mobile navigation system. For researchers the taxonomy\ncan also be used as an aid for scoping out future research in the area of\nubiquitous positioning."

This approach is very similar to\nthe GPS paradigm. Traditionally, three orthogonal slices in the patient data\nare presented on a distant screen.

Autocorrelation with some specific lag is computed for the\nresidual signal to derive these features.

With three examples of graphical interaction, we show\nhow to express them with the architecture, how to implement them, and how this\nimproves programming usability.

In the past decade, on-line multiuser virtual environments have\noffered a solution for training teams whose members are geographically\ndispersed. In order to develop on effective team training activity, a high\nsense of presence among the participant needs to be reached. Previous research\nstudies reported being able to reach a high level of presence even when using\ninexpensive technology such as laptop and headset. This study evaluates the\nlevel of presence of ten subjects who have to perform a team-building activity\nin a multi-user virtual environment using a laptop computer and a headset. The\nauthors are interested in determining which user characterizes, such as gender,\nage and knowledge of computers, have a strong correlation with the level of\nsense of presence. The results of this study showed that female participants\nwere more likely to engage in the activity and perceived fewer negative\neffects. Participants who reported less negative effects such as feeling tired,\ndizzy, or experiencing eye strain during the team-building activity reached a\nhigher level of sense of presence."

    "summary": "Most of energy efficiency and carbon reduction initiatives and concepts\nattempt to regulate and optimize machines behavior, and therefore, human\nbehavior itself is left neglected. Although most of energy and resource\nconsumption is the result of machines functioning and behavior (including\ndomesticated animals such as cows), these behaviors themselves are actually in\nanswer to humans demands and needs, and therefore, can be considered the\nindirect results of humans behavior. Resolving the source of problems, i.e.,\nthe unhealthy human behavior, not only reduces these footprints including\nenergy and water consumption, and GHG emissions, it also helps increasing the\nquality of life in society. Here, we propose an approach which focuses on\nadjusting humans behavior toward eliminating unnecessary demand on the machines\nthat consequently lowers the consumption. This goal is achieved by creating a\nsocial environment in which directed and selective interactions help humans to\nadjust to healthier behavior. The solution consists of human-friendly\ninterfaces and also artificial intelligence software in order to learn and\nemulate human interactions."

    "summary": "This paper presents a technology that enables the watching of videos at very\nhigh speed. Subtitles are widely used in DVD movies, and provide useful\nsupplemental information for understanding video contents. We propose a\n\"two-level fast-forwarding\" scheme for videos with subtitles, which controls\nthe speed of playback depending on the context: very fast during segments\nwithout language, such as subtitles or speech, and \"understandably fast\" during\nsegments with such language. This makes it possible to watch videos at a higher\nspeed than usual while preserving the entertainment values of the contents. We\nalso propose \"centering\" and \"fading\" features for the display of subtitles to\nreduce fatigue when watching high-speed video. We implement a versatile video\nencoder that enables movie viewing with two-level fast-forwarding on any mobile\ndevice by specifying the speed of playback, the reading rate, or the overall\nviewing time. The effectiveness of our proposed method was demonstrated in an\nevaluation study."

    "summary": "We present a controlled, quantitative study with 12 participants comparing\ninteraction with a haptically enhanced mixing board against interaction with a\nmouse in an abstract task that is motivated by several practical parameter\nspace exploration settings.\n  The study participants received 24 sets of one to eight integer values\nbetween 0 and 127, which they had to match by making adjustments with physical\nor graphical sliders. Based on recorded slider motion path data, we developed\nan analysis algorithm that identifies and measures different types of activity\nintervals, including error time moving irrelevant sliders and end time in\nbreaks after completing each trial item. Our results showed a significant\nincrease in speed of the mixing board interaction accompanied by reduced\nperceived cognitive load when compared with the traditional mouse-based GUI\ninteraction. The gains in speed are largely due to the improved times required\nfor the hand to reach for the first slider (acquisition time) and also when\nmoving between different ones, while the actual time spent manipulating\nrelevant sliders is very similar for either input device. These results agree\nstrongly with qualitative predictions from Fitts' Law that the larger targets\nafforded by the mixer handles contributed to its faster performance. For\nfurther investigation, we computed a measure of motion simultaneity based on\nvelocity correlation, which allowed to identify types of items for which\nincreased simultaneous adjustments occur.\n  For continuous parameter space exploration our findings suggest that mixing\nboards are a good option to provide detailed multi-value control. The strengths\nof this input method particularly show in settings where screen space is\nprecious and undisrupted visual focus is crucial."

First efforts to visualize are made by the data providers\nthemselves. Data aggregators go a step beyond: they collect data from different\nopen data repositories and make them comparable by providing data sets from\ndifferent providers and showing different statistics in the same chart. Another\napproach is to visualize two different indicators in a scatter plot or on a\nmap. The integration of several data sets in one graph can have several\ndrawbacks: different scales and units are mixed, the graph gets visually\ncluttered and one cannot easily distinguish between different indicators. Our\napproach marks a combination of (1) the integration of live data from different\ndata sources, (2) presenting different indicators in coordinated visualizations\nand (3) allows adding user visualizations to enrich official statistics with\npersonal data. Each indicator gets its own visualization, which fits best for\nthe individual indicator in case of visualization type, scale, unit etc. The\ndifferent visualizations are linked, so that related items can easily be\nidentified by using mouse over effects on data items."

The\nadvent of crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and\nCrowdFlower offer an intriguing new avenue for performing remote usability\ntesting with potentially many users, quick turn-around, and significant cost\nsavings. To investigate the potential of such crowdsourced usability testing,\nwe conducted two similar (though not completely parallel) usability studies\nwhich evaluated a graduate school's website: one via a traditional usability\nlab setting, and the other using crowdsourcing. While we find crowdsourcing\nexhibits some notable limitations in comparison to the traditional lab\nenvironment, its applicability and value for usability testing is clearly\nevidenced. We discuss both methodological differences for crowdsourced\nusability testing, as well as empirical contrasts to results from more\ntraditional, face-to-face usability testing."

Until now, most of the efforts to\nintegrate MKM services into editing environments are done on an individual\nbasis which results in high creation and maintenance costs. In this paper, I\npropose an architecture which allows editing environments and MKM services to\nbe integrated in a more efficient way. This is accomplished by integrating\neditors and services only once with a real-time document synchronization and\nservice broker. Doing so, simplifies the development of services as well as of\neditor integrations. My experience suggests that integrating new services into\nan arbitrary number of already integrated editors can take as little as 3-4\nhours of work."

As\nmobile phones are becoming the crucial source of accessing the contents of the\nWorld Wide Web which was originally designed for personal computers, has opened\nup a new challenge of accommodating the web contents in to the smaller mobile\ndevices. This paper proposes an approach towards building a model for rendering\nthe web pages in mobile devices. The proposed model is based on a\nmulti-dimensional web page segment evaluation model. The incorporation of\npersonalization in the proposed model makes the rendering user-centric. The\nproposed model is validated with a prototype implementation."

    "summary": "This paper explores using RSS measurements on many links in a wireless\nnetwork to estimate the breathing rate of a person, and the location where the\nbreathing is occurring, in a home, while the person is sitting, laying down,\nstanding, or sleeping. The main challenge in breathing rate estimation is that\n\"motion interference\", i.e., movements other than a person's breathing,\ngenerally cause larger changes in RSS than inhalation and exhalation. We\ndevelop a method to estimate breathing rate despite motion interference, and\ndemonstrate its performance during multiple short (3-7 minute) tests and during\na longer 66 minute test. Further, for the same experiments, we show the\nlocation of the breathing person can be estimated, to within about 2 m average\nerror in a 56 square meter apartment. Being able to locate a breathing person\nwho is not otherwise moving, without calibration, is important for applications\nin search and rescue, health care, and security."

    "summary": "In recent years videogame companies have recognized the role of player\nengagement as a major factor in user experience and enjoyment. This encouraged\na greater investment in new types of game controllers such as the WiiMote, Rock\nBand instruments and the Kinect. However, the native software of these\ncontrollers was not originally designed to be used in other game applications.\nThis work addresses this issue by building a middleware framework, which maps\nbody poses or voice commands to actions in any game. This not only warrants a\nmore natural and customized user-experience but it also defines an\ninteroperable virtual controller. In this version of the framework, body poses\nand voice commands are respectively recognized through the Kinect's built-in\ncameras and microphones. The acquired data is then translated into the native\ninteraction scheme in real time using a lightweight method based on spatial\nrestrictions. The system is also prepared to use Nintendo's Wiimote as an\nauxiliary and unobtrusive gamepad for physically or verbally impractical\ncommands. System validation was performed by analyzing the performance of\ncertain tasks and examining user reports. Both confirmed this approach as a\npractical and alluring alternative to the game's native interaction scheme. In\nsum, this framework provides a game-controlling tool that is totally\ncustomizable and very flexible, thus expanding the market of game consumers."

    "summary": "This research explores the accessibility issues with regard to the e-commerce\nwebsites in developing countries, through a study of Sri Lankan hotel websites.\nA web survey and a web content analysis were conducted as the methods to elicit\ndata on web accessibility. Factors preventing accessibility were hypothesized\nas an initial experiment. Affecting design elements are identified through web\ncontent analysis, the results of which are utilized to develop specific\nimplications for improving web accessibility. The hypothesis tests show that\nthere is no significant correlation between accessibility and geographical or\neconomic factors. However, physical impairments of users have a considerable\ninfluence on the accessibility of web page user interface if it has been\ndesigned without full consideration of the needs of all users. Especially,\nvisual and mobility impaired users experience poor accessibility. Poor\nreadability and less navigable page designs are two observable issues, which\npose threats to accessibility. The lack of conformance to W3C accessibility\nguidelines and the poor design process are the specific shortcomings which\nreduce the overall accessibility. Guidelines aim to improve the accessibility\nof sites with a strategic focus. Further enhancements are suggested with\nadherence to principles, user centered design and developing customizable web\nportals compatible for connections with differing speeds. Re-ordering search\nresults has been suggested as one of the finest step towards making the web\ncontent accessible for users with differing needs. A need for developing new\ndesign models for differencing user groups and implementing web accessibility\nstrategy are emphasized as vital steps towards effective information\ndissemination via e-commerce websites in the developing countries."

To\nfully test related software and algorithms, researchers require a diverse pool\nof data with known and desired features. Test data do not always provide this,\nor only partially. Here we propose the paradigm WYDIWYGS (What You Draw Is What\nYou Get). Its embodiment, Sketch Pad ND, is a tool that allows users to\ngenerate high-dimensional data in the same interface they also use for\nvisualization. This provides for an immersive and direct data generation\nactivity, and furthermore it also enables users to interactively edit and clean\nexisting high-dimensional data from possible artifacts. Sketch Pad ND offers\ntwo visualization paradigms, one based on parallel coordinates and the other\nbased on a relatively new framework using an N-D polygon to navigate in\nhigh-dimensional space. The first interface allows users to draw arbitrary\nprofiles of probability density functions along each dimension axis and sketch\nshapes for data density and connections between adjacent dimensions. The second\ninterface embraces the idea of sculpting. Users can carve data at arbitrary\norientations and refine them wherever necessary. This guarantees the data\ngenerated is truly high-dimensional. We demonstrate our tool's usefulness in\nreal data visualization scenarios."

Therefore many people are\nnow working with computer for longer hours of time. There is no doubt that this\nincorporation of computer has helped users a lot but it also brings problems to\nthe users. One of the problems is Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Five hundred\nand thirty one (531) questionnaires were personally administered to different\ncategories of people that use computer in various works of life, ranging from\nbanking sector, civil service, educational sector, health sector to private\nsector. The distribution cut across different professions. A statistical\nanalysis was conducted on the data obtained using frequency distribution,\nPearson Correlation and Linear Regression. The result obtained showed that\n94.3% of the respondents suffered pain from one or more parts of the body.\n86.8% of the respondents suffered from eyestrain, 63.9% suffered from low back\npain, 67.4% with wrist pain, 64.7% finger pain while the least suffered pain\nwas foot pain which only 19% responded positively to it. There are significant\nrelationships between duration of computer usage, type of chair used, type and\nsize of monitor used and the incidence of RSI. RSI modeled was formulated\nthrough linear regression which showed that a unit change in computer will\nresult in corresponding 1.76 unit increases in RSI and a unit change in\nergonomic deficiency will also result in corresponding 0.66 increases in RSI.\nThe existence of RSI was established and it was discovered that the more time\nspent on the computer system, the more the proximity of having strain or pain\nin one or more part(s) of the body."

They have started to include accessibility features\nthat enable the inclusion of disabled people. However, these inclusive efforts\nstill fall short considering the possibilities of such devices.

    "summary": "Mobile phones pervade our daily lives and play ever expanding roles in many\ncontexts. Their ubiquitousness makes them pivotal in empowering disabled\npeople. However, if no inclusive approaches are provided, it becomes a strong\nvehicle of exclusion. Even though current solutions try to compensate for the\nlack of sight, not all information reaches the blind user. Good spatial ability\nis still required to make sense of the device and its interface, as well as the\nneed to memorize positions on screen or keys and associated actions in a\nkeypad. Those problems are compounded by many individual attributes such as\nage, age of blindness onset or tactile sensitivity which often are forgotten by\ndesigners. Worse, the entire blind population is recurrently thought of as\nhomogeneous (often stereotypically so). Thus all users face the same solutions,\nignoring their specific capabilities and needs. We usually ignore this\ndiversity as we have the ability to adapt and become experts in interfaces that\nwere probably maladjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always within\nreach. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which\nwidens this gap amongst blind people. It is paramount to understand the impact\nof individual differences and their relationship with demands to enable the\ndeployment of more inclusive solutions. We explore individual differences among\nblind people and assess how they are related with mobile interface demands,\nboth at low (e.g. performing an on-screen gesture) and high level (text-entry)\ntasks. Results confirmed that different ability levels have significant impact\non the performance attained by a blind person. Particularly, otherwise ignored\nattributes like tactile acuity, pressure sensitivity, spatial ability or verbal\nIQ have shown to be matched with specific mobile demands and parametrizations."

Human gesture recognition in mobile interaction\nappears as an important area to provide suitable on-the-move usability. We\npresent a body space based approach to improve mobile device interaction and\nmobile performance, which we named as Mnemonical Body Shortcuts. The human body\nis presented as a rich repository of meaningful relations which are always\navailable to interact with. These body-based gestures allow the user to\nnaturally interact with mobile devices with no movement limitations.\nPreliminary studies using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology were\nperformed, validating Mnemonical Body Shortcuts as an appropriate new mobile\ninteraction mechanism. Following those studies, we developed inertial sensing\nprototypes using an accelerometer, ending in the construction and user testing\nof a gestural interface for mobile devices capable of properly recognizing\nMnemonical Body Shortcuts and also providing suitable user control mechanisms\nand audio, visual and haptic feedback."

Having to surpass and deal with these difficulties\nthat arise with their condition is something that we can help diminish. They\nare one sense down when trying to understand their surrounding environments and\ngather information about what is happening around them. Nowadays, mobile\ndevices present significant computing and technological capacity which has been\nincreasing to the point where it is very common for most people to have access\nto a device with Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and both high processing and storage\ncapacities. This allows us to think of applications that can do so much to help\npeople with difficulties. In the particular case of blind people, the lack of\nvisual information can be bypassed with other contextual information retrieved\nby their own personal devices. Our goal is to provide information to blind\nusers, be able to give them information about the context that surrounds them.\nWe wanted to provide the blind users with the tools to create information and\nbe able to share this information between each other, information about people,\nlocations or objects. Our approach was to split the project into a data and\ninformation gathering phase where we did our field search and interviewed and\nelaborated on how is the situation of environment perception for blind users,\nfollowed by a technical phase where we implement a system based on the first\nstage. Our results gathered from both the collecting phase and our implementing\nphase showed that there is potential to use these tools in the blind community\nand that they welcome the possibilities and horizons that it opens them."

In the Intelligent User Interface, where the dialog\nsituations are unknown in advance, fuzzy structured and artificial intelligence\nis crucial, the redesign described above is impossible. To solve this and other\nproblems, we propose the data, information and knowledge based technology of\nSmart/ Intelligent User Interface (IUI) design, which interacts with users and\nsystems in natural and other languages, utilizing the principles of Situational\nControl and Fuzzy Logic theories, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics,\nKnowledge Base technologies and others. The proposed technology of IUI design\nis defined by multi-agents of Situational Control and of data, information and\nknowledge, modelling of Fuzzy Logic Inference, Generalization, Representation\nand Explanation of knowledge, Planning and Decision-making, Dialog Control,\nReasoning and Systems Thinking, Fuzzy Control of organizational unit in\nreal-time, fuzzy conditions, heterogeneous domains, and multi-lingual\ncommunication under uncertainty and in Fuzzy Environment."

Regarding to the Canvas application in designing\ninteractive graphical user interface, vision-impaired users may miss important\ninformation on web sites. This paper utilizes the content-based image retrieval\n(CBIR) technique as well as code mapping embedded in a Firefox extension to\npresent a novel approach in order to make Canvas interactive user interface\naccessible. This extension replaces Canvas with an accessible equivalent HTML\nenvironment.

    "summary": "Pen pressure is an input channel typically available in tablet pen device. To\ndate, little attention has been paid to the use of pressure in the domain of\ngraphical interaction, its usage largely limited to drawing and painting\nprogram, typically for varying brush characteristic such as stroke width,\nopacity and color. In this paper, we explore the use of pressure in 3D curve\ndrawing. The act of controlling pressure using pen, pencil and brush in real\nlife appears effortless, but to mimic this natural ability to control pressure\nusing a pressure sensitive pen in the realm of electronic medium is difficult.\nPrevious pressure based interaction work have proposed various signal\nprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy in pressure control, but a\none-for-all signal processing solution tend not to work for different curve\ntypes. We propose instead a framework which applies signal processing\ntechniques tuned to individual curve type. A neural network classifier is used\nas a curve classifier. Based on the classification, a custom combination of\nsignal processing techniques is then applied. Results obtained point to the\nfeasibility and advantage of the approach."

    "summary": "The automobile is always a point of interest where new technology has been\ndeployed. Because of this interest, human-vehicle interaction has been an\nappealing area for much research in recent years. The current in-vehicle design\nhas been improved but still possesses some of the design from the traditional\ninteraction style. In this paper, we propose a new user-oriented model for\nin-vehicle interaction model known as i-Interaction. The i-Interaction model\nprovides user with an intuitive approach to interact with the In-Vehicle\nInformation System (IVIS) by the keypad entry. It is the intent that the\nproposed usability testing for this model will help improve the way research\nand development is implemented from this topic. This model does not only\nprovide the user with a direct interaction in vehicles but also introduce a new\nprospective that other research has not addressed."

    "summary": "Usability is often defined as the ability of a system to carry out specific\ntasks by specific users in a specific context. Usability evaluation involves\ntesting the system for its expected usability. Usability testing is performed\nin natural environment (field) or artificial environment (laboratory). The\nresult of usability evaluation is affected by the environment in which it is\ncarried out. Previous studies have focused only on the physical environment\n(lab and field) effect on the results but rarely focused on the effect of\nsocial environment (people present during testing). Therefore, this study aims\nto review how important it is to take context into account during usability\nevaluation. Context is explored through the theory of behaviour settings,\naccording to which behaviour of individuals is strongly influenced by the\nphysical as well as the social environment in which they function. The result\nof this review indicates that the physical and social context plays a\nsubstantial role in usability evaluations. Further, it also suggests that the\nusability evaluation model should encompass context as an important component\nin the framework."

This has been a topic of active research\nsince the Web started and a large body of work exists. However, new online\nservices as well as advances in Web and mobile technologies clearly changed the\nmeaning behind \"browsing the Web\" and require a fresh look at the problem and\nresearch, specifically in respect to whether the used models are still\nappropriate. Platforms such as YouTube, Netflix or last.fm have started to\nreplace the traditional media channels (cinema, television, radio) and media\ndistribution formats (CD, DVD, Blu-ray). Social networks (e.g., Facebook) and\nplatforms for browser games attracted whole new, particularly less tech-savvy\naudiences. Furthermore, advances in mobile technologies and devices made\nbrowsing \"on-the-move\" the norm and changed the user behavior as in the mobile\ncase browsing is often being influenced by the user's location and context in\nthe physical world. Commonly used datasets, such as web server access logs or\nsearch engines transaction logs, are inherently not capable of capturing the\nbrowsing behavior of users in all these facets. DOBBS (DERI Online Behavior\nStudy) is an effort to create such a dataset in a non-intrusive, completely\nanonymous and privacy-preserving way. To this end, DOBBS provides a browser\nadd-on that users can install, which keeps track of their browsing behavior\n(e.g., how much time they spent on the Web, how long they stay on a website,\nhow often they visit a website, how they use their browser, etc.). In this\npaper, we outline the motivation behind DOBBS, describe the add-on and captured\ndata in detail, and present some first results to highlight the strengths of\nDOBBS."

Much of this work involves the\nuse of high-bandwidth communications or targeted sensory experiences using\nlarge format displays. There are also existing remote access technologies but\nthese suffer from limited functionality (providing text, voice, video or\none-way desktop sharing), are often poorly supported in the security-conscious\ncorporate environment and require complicated set up processes. There is\ncurrently no singular piece of remote collaboration technology that is suitable\nfor the delivery of high-quality planning and scheduling services to clients at\na mining site from a remote operating centre. In response to this issue, as\npart of a research and technology development effort between CSIRO and a mining\nengineering firm, we have developed a concept of remote mining engineer (RME)\nand conducted a functional requirements analysis for delivering mining\nengineering services to mine sites remotely. Based on the obtained\nrequirements, a further study was performed to characterise existing\ntechnologies and to identify the scope for future work in designing and\nprototyping a network based system for RME. We report on the method and\nfindings of this study in this paper."

    "summary": "Effective communication and strong therapeutic relationships are critical to\nsuccessful mental health interventions. For example, in 1957 Carl Rogers, a\npioneer of person-centred therapy, proposed that an empowering relationship\ncould, in and of itself, create the necessary and sufficient conditions for\npositive therapeutic outcomes [1]. Whilst modern psychological theories no\nlonger favour an exclusive focus on relationships, positive relationships and\nthe dynamics of client-therapist communication remain cornerstones of mental\nhealth intervention theories. A more recent meta-review concluded that across\nall interventions models, irrespective of the theoretical approach, the quality\nof the relationship between therapists and clients is the second leading\ndeterminant of successful clinical outcomes [2]. Over the past ten years we\n(David Coyle and Gavin Doherty) have designed and evaluated a wide range to\nsystems that provide support for psychological (or talk- based) mental health\ninterventions [3]. Here we briefly consider two recent examples. In each case\nour aim was to enhance communication and reshape clinical practice in a manner\nthat empowers patients. gNats Island is a computer game that supports\nface-to-face interventions for adolescents [4]. MindBalance is an online\ntreatment programme for adults experiencing difficulties with depression [5]."

The key question behind\nthe CHI 2012 paper was: can we apply intention binding to provide an implicit\nmeasure for the experience of control in human-computer interactions?

    "summary": "Web accessibility is actually the most important aspect for providing access\nto information and interaction for people with disabilities. However, it seems\nthat the ability of users with disabilities to navigate over the Web is not\ndependent on the graphical complexity, but on the markup used to create the\nstructure of the website. Consequently, it is necessary to design some software\nassistants to help all users to mark themselves in space during a navigation\nsession. In this paper, we propose an assistant for browsing on the Internet to\nallow user to get one s bearings within Web navigation. We describe our\napproach which puts at the disposal of the user a visited site map, thus giving\nan explicit representation of virtual space.

    "summary": "The standard QWERTY keyboard was developed in the late 1800s for the\ntypewriters. As people were acquainted with that the same layout was retained\nfor the computer keyboards. Many people feel that the QWERTY layout is not very\nefficient layout and there have been many inventions on different layouts of\ncharacter keys.\n  In order to improve the key arrangement, two major issues should be\naddressed. (i) The improved key arrangement should offer significantly improved\nproductivity. (ii) The training time for learning the improved key arrangement\nshould be minimized.\n  This article analyzes 10 inventions from US patent database each of which\nhave proposed a new layout giving us some specific advantage. The inventions\ntry to achieve one or more of the following advantages, viz., to reduce finger\nmovements during typing, to achieve speed in data entry, to reduce errors in\ntyping, making keyboard easy to learn, making easy for children to find keys,\nreduce stress in hands and finger and suitability for special purpose\ncomputers."

    "summary": "A computer keyboard consists of several sections and each section consists of\nseveral numbers of keys. The text entry section contains the standard character\nkeys, navigation section contains cursor movement and page control keys,\nnumeric keypad contains numeric keys and function keys section contain function\nkeys and special keys. Although the increased number of keys helps smooth\ninteraction with a computer there are situations where it is necessary to\nreduce the number of keys.\n  The need for reducing number of keys in a keyboard creates a technical\ncontradiction. Generally more number of keys can support more number of\nfunctions and less number of keys can support less number of functions. We need\nmore number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard),\nbut we want only less number of keys (Contradiction). This contradiction has\nbeen solved by using multi-stroke mechanism.\n  There may be different purposes to reduce the number of keys in a keyboard.\nSome of them intend to reduce the size of the keyboard while some others intend\nto increase the speed of typing. But all of these inventions use multi-stroke\nmechanism to generate more number of signals from less number of keys."

But there are many situations where the user may\nlike to work on his computer under low light conditions, such as, during\nnights, while traveling in flights/ trains having low lights, working in the\ngarden during evening etc. So it is necessary to provide some light to the\nlaptop to operate the keyboard under low light situations.\n  Luminescence of the keyboard is a desirable feature for portable computers.\nThere may be several methods to illuminate the keyboard, the most crude may be\ncarrying an external light and fixing at a point where it can light the\nkeyboard. But solutions like this are not very convenient. The inventors have\nbeen looking for better solutions. This article analyses 6 patents on keyboard\nillumination.\n  A good illumination system do not consume more battery, do not increase the\nsize and weight of the laptop, do not increase heat inside the laptop box, and\ndo not cost much to manufacture. The light should uniformly illuminate the\nwhole keyboard and should not throw light on other areas that are not required."

    "summary": "This paper examines coordination in transparent work environments -\nenvironments where the content of work artifacts, and the actions taken on\nthese artifacts, are fully visible to organizational members. Our qualitative\nstudy of a community of open source software developers revealed a coordination\nsystem characterized by interest-based, asynchronous interaction and knowledge\ntransfer. At the core of asynchronous knowledge transfer, lies the concept of\nquasi-codification, which occurs when rich process knowledge is implicitly\nencoded in work artifacts. Our findings suggest that members are able to more\nselectively form dependencies, monitor the trajectory of projects, and make\ntheir work understandable to others which facilitates coordination. We discuss\ntwo important characteristics that enable coordination activities in a\ntransparent environment: the presence of an imagined audience that dictates the\nway artifacts are crafted, and experience within the environment, that allows\nindividuals to derive knowledge from these artifacts. By showing how\ntransparency influences coordination, this research challenges previous\nconceptions of coordination for complex, collaborative work."

    "summary": "Background: Plant breeders are utilising an increasingly diverse range of\ndata types in order to identify lines that have desirable characteristics which\nare suitable to be taken forward in plant breeding programmes. There are a\nnumber of key morphological and physiological traits such as disease resistance\nand yield that are required to be maintained, and improved upon if a commercial\nvariety is to be successful. Computational tools that provide the ability to\npull this data together, and integrate with pedigree structure, will enable\nbreeders to make better decisions on which plant lines are used in crossings to\nmeet both critical demands for increased yield/production and adaptation to\nclimate change. Results: We have used a large and unique set of experimental\nbarley (H. vulgare) data to develop a prototype pedigree visualization system\nand performed a subjective user evaluation with domain experts to guide and\ndirect the development of an interactive pedigree visualization tool which we\nhave called Helium. Conclusions: We show that Helium allows users to easily\nintegrate a number of data types along with large plant pedigrees to offer an\nintegrated environment in which they can explore pedigree data. We have also\nverified that users were happy with the abstract representation of pedigrees\nthat we have used in our visualization tool."

    "summary": "Compared to real world tasks, completing tasks in a virtual environment (VE)\nseldom involves the whole spectrum of skills the human body offers. User input\nin a VE is commonly accomplished through simple finger gestures, such as\nwalking in a scene by simply pressing a button, even if this kind of\ninteraction is not very suitable. In order to create a more intuitive and\nnatural interaction, diverse projects try to tackle the problem of locomotion\nin VEs by trying to enable a natural walking movement, which is also supposed\nto increase the level of immersion. Existing solutions such as treadmills are\nstill expensive and need additional fixation of the body. In this paper, we\ndescribe a simple and inexpensive way to build a useful locomotion interface\nusing a conventional sports stepper and an Arduino. This device enables control\nin a VE by walking-in-place and without the need for any additional fixation\ngadgets. We conducted a user study with 10 participants to evaluate the\nimpression on the joy and ease of use, immersion and reliability in comparison\nto other interfaces used for locomotion, such as the Wii Balance Board and a\nWand Joystick. We found out that the stepper is experienced slightly better in\nterms of immersion and joy of use. Furthermore, found that pressing buttons on\na Joystick was perceived to be more reliable."

    "summary": "The analysis of user behavior in digital games has been aided by the\nintroduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides\nunprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed\ngame clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry\ndatasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying\npopulation of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration.\nCategorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g.\nsegmention) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for\nfinding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are\nactionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised\nclustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior\ncategorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual\nplay behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of\nunsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to\ndevelop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft\nplayers, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with\nrespect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the\ndataset."

Individual power consumption, while providing\nuseful feedback and motivation for energy saving, can be used as a valuable\nsource for presence detection. We conduct pilot experiments in an office\nsetting to collect individual presence data by ultrasonic sensors, acceleration\nsensors, and WiFi access points, in addition to the individual power monitoring\ndata. PresenceSense (PS), a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on power\nmeasurement that trains itself with only unlabeled data, is proposed, analyzed\nand evaluated in the study. Without any labeling efforts, which are usually\ntedious and time consuming, PresenceSense outperforms popular models whose\nparameters are optimized over a large training set. The results are interpreted\nand potential applications of PresenceSense on other data sources are\ndiscussed. The significance of this study attaches to space security, occupancy\nbehavior modeling, and energy saving of plug loads."

    "summary": "Identifying locations of occupants is beneficial to energy management in\nbuildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional\nareas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room\nlevel localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage\nreduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon\nthis observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or\na mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,\nhowever, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.\n  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic\nacoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for\ninfrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be\ncharacterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise\nRIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our\nwork are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is\nimplemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm\nis developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,\na comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from\nRIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of\nten (10) different rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates\nthe potential to be integrated into automatic mapping of building space."

If pie menus are used with multiple depth\nlayers then multiple saccades are required per selection of item, which is\ninefficient because it consumes more time. Also dwell time selection method is\nlimited in performance because higher dwell time suffers from inefficiency\nwhile lower one from inaccuracy. To overcome problems with multiple depth\nlayers and dwell time, we designed Quickpie, an interface for eye gaze based\ntext entry with only one depth layer of pie menu and selection border as\nselection method instead of dwell time. We investigated various parameters like\nnumber of slices in pie menu, width characters and safe region, enlarged angle\nof slice and selection methods to achieve better performance. Our experiment\nresults indicates that six number of slices with width of characters area 120\npx performs better as compared to other designs."

These results describe two views of\nspreadsheet design and use in organizations, and reflect gaps between these two\ngroups and between these groups and the entire population of nearly 1600\nrespondents. Moreover, our results indicate that these gaps have multiple\ndimensions: they reflect not only the context, skill, and practices of\nindividual users but also the policies of large organizations."

    "summary": "The hard coding of input data or constants into spreadsheet formulas is\nwidely recognised as poor spreadsheet model design. However, the importance of\navoiding such practice appears to be underestimated perhaps in light of the\nlack of quantitative error at the time of occurrence and the recognition that\nthis design defect may never result in a bottom-line error. The paper examines\nboth the academic and practitioner view of such hard coding design flaws. The\npractitioner or industry viewpoint is gained indirectly through a review of\ncommercial spreadsheet auditing software. The development of an automated\n(electronic) means for detecting such hard coding is described together with a\ndiscussion of some results obtained through analysis of a number of student and\npractitioner spreadsheet models."

    "summary": "Even relatively simple code analysis can be a daunting task for many first\nyear students. Perceived complexity, coupled with foreign and harsh syntax,\noften outstrips the ability for students to take in what they are seeing in\nterms of their verbal memory. That is, first year students often lack the\nexperience to encode critical building blocks in source code, and their\ninterrelationships, into their own words. We believe this argues for the need\nfor IDEs to provide additional support for representations that would appeal\ndirectly to visual memory. In this paper, we examine this need for intuitive\nsource code visualization tools that are easily accessible to novice\nprogrammers, discuss the requirements for such a tool, and suggest a novel idea\nthat takes advantage of human peripheral vision to achieve stronger overall\ncode structure awareness."

    "summary": "With customer relationship management (CRM) companies move away from a mainly\nproduct-centered view to a customer-centered view. Resulting from this change,\nthe effective management of how to keep contact with customers throughout\ndifferent channels is one of the key success factors in today's business world.\nCompany Web sites have evolved in many industries into an extremely important\nchannel through which customers can be attracted and retained. To analyze and\noptimize this channel, accurate models of how customers browse through the Web\nsite and what information within the site they repeatedly view are crucial.\nTypically, data mining techniques are used for this purpose. However, there\nalready exist numerous models developed in marketing research for traditional\nchannels which could also prove valuable to understanding this new channel. In\nthis paper we propose the application of an extension of the Logarithmic Series\nDistribution (LSD) model repeat-usage of Web-based information and thus to\nanalyze and optimize a Web Site's capability to support one goal of CRM, to\nretain customers. As an example, we use the university's blended learning web\nportal with over a thousand learning resources to demonstrate how the model can\nbe used to evaluate and improve the Web site's effectiveness."

However, applications developed in these tools have high error\nrisk, and no best practices exist. We recommend that advanced, highly\nmathematical applications incorporate these tools with spreadsheets into hybrid\napplications, where developers can apply EuSpRIG best practices. Development of\nhybrid applications can reduce the potential for errors, shorten development\ntime, and enable higher level operations.

Microsoft Excel has essentially become a scratch pad and a data\nbrowser that can quickly be put to use for information gathering and\ndecision-making. However, there is little control in how data comes into Excel,\nand how it gets updated. The information supply chain feeding into Excel\nremains ad hoc and without any centralized IT control. This paper discusses\nsome of the pitfalls of the data collection and maintenance process in Excel.\nIt then suggests service-oriented architecture (SOA) based information\ngathering and control techniques to ameliorate the pitfalls of this scratch pad\nwhile improving the integrity of data, boosting the productivity of the\nbusiness users, and building controls to satisfy the requirements of Section\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."

The unconscious participation occurs independently\nof one's cognitive and educational levels and, if ignored, leads to learning\ninefficiencies and compulsive behaviours, illustrations of which are provided.\nThree practical approaches to a study of subjective user experience are\noutlined as follows: (a) tracing operant conditioning effects of software, (b)\nregistering signs of brain activity psychological or information processing\nmeaning of which is well-explored and (c) exploring submodality interfaces.\nImplications for improvement of current usability study methods, such as\neye-tracking, are generally considered.

    "summary": "Selection methods that require only a single-switch input, such as a button\nclick or blink, are potentially useful for individuals with motor impairments,\nmobile technology users, and individuals wishing to transmit information\nsecurely. We present a single-switch selection method, \"Nomon,\" that is general\nand efficient. Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable\noptions to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast,\ntraditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such\nas drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however,\nhas the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically\nto an individual's clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to\nmake a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time\nto make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by\nallowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection\nprobabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct\n(posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application\nand a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon's performance, we compared the\nwriting application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing\n(row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface\nthan with the scanning interface. An experienced user (author TB, with > 10\nhours practice) wrote at speeds of 9.3 words per minute with Nomon, using 1.2\nclicks per character and making no errors in the final text."

    "summary": "Designing human computer interaction interface is an important and a complex\ntask, but it could be simplified by decomposing task into subcomponents and\nmaintaining relationships among those subcomponents. Task decomposition is a\nstructured approach, applicable in both Software Engineering and Human Computer\nInteraction (HCI) fields depending on specific processes and design artifacts.\nUsing design artifacts applications could be made for analysis and design by\nmaking the hand draw sketches to provide high level of logical design based on\nuser requirements, usage scenarios and essential use cases. To design hand draw\nsketches there are some strategies to be followed .i.e., planning, sequential\nwork flow, and levels of details. In this research paper we are presenting\ndesign artifacts, goals, principles, guidelines and currently faced problems to\nhuman computer interaction design community. Moreover in the end concluded with\nassessed observations in a case study."

This research paper is basically about to propose an\nintelligent, flexible and user friendly machine interface for Product Life\nCycle Management products or PDM Systems since studies show that usability and\nhuman computer interaction issues are a major cause of acceptance problems\nintroducing or using such systems. Going into details of the proposition, we\npresent prototype implementations about theme based on design requirements,\ndesigned designs and technologies involved for the development of human machine\ninterface."

    "summary": "This paper introduces real time inverse arithmetic coding and user interfaces\nbased thereupon. The main idea is that information-efficient data entry can be\nachieved by ensuring that each input's associated display space and ease of\nselection are at all times related to the input's probability of being\nselected. As with data entry based on inverse arithmetic coding, the layout\ninitially depends on the probabilities of the possible inputs; however, real\ntime inverse arithmetic coding differs in that the user's actions are\ninterpreted not to navigate this probability distribution but rather to modify\nit according to a learned update rule, which approximates the conditioning of\nthe probability distribution on the user's actions. Potential applications of\nreal time inverse arithmetic coding include text entry, file browsing,\nintegrated multi-program user interfaces, assistive technologies for users with\nmovement disabilities, and ergonomic input methods."

Mindmaps are visual, graph-based\nrepresenations of concepts, ideas, notes, tasks, etc. They generally take a\nhierarchical or tree branch format, with ideas branching into their\nsubsections. FreePub supports creativity cycles. A user starts such a cycle by\nsetting up her domain of interest using mindmaps. Then, she can browse mindmaps\nand launch search tasks to gather relevant publications from several data\nsources. FreePub, besides publications, identifies helpful supporting material\n(e.g., blog posts, presentations). All retrieved information from FreePub can\nbe imported and organized in mindmaps. FreePub has been fully implemented on\ntop of FreeMind, a popular open-source, mindmapping tool."

First, the presenter's hand movements\ntend to distract the audience's attention from content. Second, the presenter'\ns manipulation tends to obscure content. In this paper we describe a new\nelectronic whiteboard system that supports multi-touch gestures and employs a\nspecial pie menu interface named \"sPieMenu.\" This pie menu is displayed under\nthe presenter's palm and is thus invisible to the audience. A series of\nexperiments shows that the proposed system allows both novice and expert users\nto efficiently manipulate the electronic whiteboard, and that the proposed\nsystem decreases distraction to the audience compared to traditional\napproaches."

However, crossing angle has not been\nused as an aesthetic criterion for graph drawing algorithms so far. In this\npaper, we introduce a force-directed method that aims to construct graph\ndrawings with large crossing angles. Experiments indicate that our method\nsignificantly increases crossing angles.

Our system is a multimodal interface\nconcerned with controlling the computer. The selected modes of interaction are\nspeech and gestures. We are seeing the revolutionary of computers and\ninformation technologies into daily practice. Healthy people use keyboard,\nmouse, trackball, or touchpad for controlling the PC. However these peripheries\nare usually not suitable for handicapped people. They may have problems using\nthese standard peripheries, for example when they suffer from myopathy, or\ncannot move their hands after an injury. Our system has been developed to\nprovide computer access for people with severe disabilities. This system tracks\nthe computer user's Head movements with a video camera and translates them into\nthe movements of the mouse pointer on the screen and the voice as button\npresses. Therefore we are coming with a proposal system that can be used with\nhandicapped people to control the PC."

Programs of the\nnew type - user-driven applications - still deliver to users the best results\nof developers' work but at the same time give users the full control over\napplications and in this way really allow each user to change an application in\nsuch a way as he wants it to look at each particular moment. Users can move and\nresize each and all of the screen objects while an application is running, and\nthis changes the whole programming philosophy."

Four different\nkinds of supporting information are compared, standard exit signs, floor plans\nwith indicated exit routes, guiding lines on the floor and simulated agents\nleading the way. The results indicate that guiding lines are the most efficient\nway to support an evacuation but the natural behavior of following others comes\nvery close.

BCI inhibitor\ncan be defined as a system that monitors user's state and inhibits BCI\ninteraction until specific requirements (e.g. brain activity pattern, user\nattention level) are met. In this pilot study, a hybrid BCI is designed and\ncomposed of a classic synchronous BCI system based on motor imagery and a BCI\ninhibitor. The BCI inhibitor initiates the control period of the BCI when\nrequirements in terms of brain activity are reached (i.e. stability in the beta\nband). Preliminary results with four participants suggest that BCI inhibitor\nsystem can improve BCI performance."

We argue that the internal information\nrepresentation should follow a spatial approach, tying the structure used to\nmanage users with the structure used to manage information, suggesting the use\nof different spaces to represent the information. The gain we expect from this\napproach is the improved capacity to extract information on how people are\ncooperating and their relationship with the information they are working with.\nThe ideas are introduced while focusing on real life emergency planning\nactivities, where we discuss the current shortcomings of the cooperation\nstrategies in use and propose a solution."

    "summary": "Display advertising has been a significant source of revenue for publishers\nand ad networks in online advertising ecosystem. One of the main goals in\ndisplay advertising is to maximize user response rate for advertising\ncampaigns, such as click through rates (CTR) or conversion rates. Although in\nthe online advertising industry we believe that the visual appearance of ads\n(creatives) matters for propensity of user response, there is no published work\nso far to address this topic via a systematic data-driven approach. In this\npaper we quantitatively study the relationship between the visual appearance\nand performance of creatives using large scale data in the world's largest\ndisplay ads exchange system, RightMedia. We designed a set of 43 visual\nfeatures, some of which are novel and some are inspired by related work. We\nextracted these features from real creatives served on RightMedia. We also\ndesigned and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nvisual features for CTR prediction, ranking and performance classification.\nBased on the evaluation results, we selected a subset of features that have the\nmost important impact on CTR. We believe that the findings presented in this\npaper will be very useful for the online advertising industry in designing\nhigh-performance creatives. It also provides the research community with the\nfirst ever data set, initial insights into visual appearance's effect on user\nresponse propensity, and evaluation benchmarks for further study."

In this paper we examine a new kind of tactile cueing for\nnon-visual interaction as a potential solution, building on earlier work on\nvibrotactile Tactons. However, unlike vibrotactile Tactons, we use a pin array\nto stimulate the finger tip. Here, we describe how to design static and dynamic\nTactons by defining their basic components. We then present user tests\nexamining how easy it is to distinguish between different forms of pin array\nTactons demonstrating accurate Tacton sets to represent directions. These\nexperiments demonstrate usable patterns for static, wave and blinking pin array\nTacton sets for guiding a user in one of eight directions. A study is then\ndescribed that shows the benefits of structuring Tactons to convey information\nthrough multiple parameters of the signal. By using multiple independent\nparameters for a Tacton, this study demonstrates participants perceive more\ninformation through a single Tacton. Two applications using these Tactons are\nthen presented: a maze exploration application and an electric circuit\nexploration application designed for use by and tested with visually impaired\nusers."

Additionally, they can also listen to what the teacher was\nsaying when a given note was written. Finally, they can add their own comments\nand documents to their notebooks to extend their lecture notes. We interviewed\nteachers and deployed questionnaires to identify both teachers and pupils'\nhabits: most of the teachers use (or would like to use) digital documents in\ntheir lectures but have problems in sharing these resources with their pupils.\nThe results of this study also show that paper remains the primary medium used\nfor knowledge keeping, sharing and editing by the pupils. Based on these\nobservations, we designed U-Note, which is built on three modules. U-Teach\ncaptures the context of the class: audio recordings, the whiteboard contents,\ntogether with the web pages, videos and slideshows displayed during the lesson.\nU-Study binds pupils' paper notes (taken with an Anoto digital pen) with the\ndata coming from U-Teach and lets pupils access the class materials at home,\nthrough their notebooks.

    "summary": "We propose a new technique to help users to explore geometric shapes without\nvision. This technique is based on a guidance using directional cues with a pin\narray. This is an alternative to the usual technique that consists of raising\nthe pins corresponding to dark pixels around the cursor. In this paper we\ncompare the exploration of geometric shapes with our new technique in unimanual\nand bimanual conditions. The users made fewer errors in unimanual condition\nthan in bimanual condition. However they did not explore the shapes more\nquickly and there was no difference in confidence in their answer."

    "summary": "In this paper we report on a system, \"SpeechJammer\", which can be used to\ndisturb people's speech. In general, human speech is jammed by giving back to\nthe speakers their own utterances at a delay of a few hundred milliseconds.\nThis effect can disturb people without any physical discomfort, and disappears\nimmediately by stop speaking. Furthermore, this effect does not involve anyone\nbut the speaker. We utilize this phenomenon and implemented two prototype\nversions by combining a direction-sensitive microphone and a\ndirection-sensitive speaker, enabling the speech of a specific person to be\ndisturbed. We discuss practical application scenarios of the system, such as\nfacilitating and controlling discussions. Finally, we argue what system\nparameters should be examined in detail in future formal studies based on the\nlessons learned from our preliminary study."

    "summary": "In global economy, turbulent organization environment strongly influences\norganization's operation. Organizations must constantly adapt to changing\ncircumstances and search for new possibilities of gaining competitive\nadvantage. To face this challenge, small organizations base their operation on\ncollaboration within Virtual Organizations (VOs). VO operation is based on\ncollaborative processes. Due to dynamism and required flexibility of\ncollaborative processes, existing business information systems are insufficient\nto efficiently support them. In this paper a novel method for supporting\ncollaborative processes based on process mining techniques is proposed. The\nmethod allows activity patterns in various instances of collaborative processes\nto be identified and used for recommendation of activities. This provides an\nopportunity for better computer support of collaborative processes leading to\nmore efficient and effective realization of business goals."

    "summary": "We carried out a qualitative study to identify the \"missing pieces\" in\ncurrent computing devices and technologies that are preventing people from\neliminating paper from their lives.\n  Most of the existing literature has looked into the work practices of\nbusinesses, while a few have researched how high school and college students\nand teaching assistants at universities work with paper. We were specifically\ninterested in analysing paper use for people in the research side of academia,\nand seeing how our results compare to existing work. We recruited and\ninterviewed participants from academia to understand what kind of tasks they\nuse paper for, what kind of tasks they use computing devices for and what\nmotivates them to use these two media.\n  We found that, despite having access to at least one personal computing\ndevice, the participants preferred to work with paper in many situations. This\nappears to be attributed to certain intrinsic qualities that paper has, such as\nopen format, easy navigation, readability, and the aff?ordances these qualities\nprovide. In order to eventually replace paper with devices, designers of new\ntechnology will have to successfully emulate these qualities."

It is admitted that this field is multidisciplinary and that the\nhuman is the core of the system. It shows two matters of concern:\nmultidisciplinary and human. The first one reveals that each discipline plays\nan important role in the global research and that the collaboration between\neveryone is needed. The second one explains that a growing number of researches\naims at making the human commitment degree increase by giving him/her a\ndecisive role in the human-machine interaction. This paper focuses on these\nboth concerns and presents MICE (Machines Interaction Control in their\nEnvironment) which is a system where the human is the one who makes the\ndecisions to manage the interaction with the machines.

This is true for humanitarian issues also. Such as the issue of\nlanguage and its primitive attraction for its native speakers which is visible\nin the cases of the language spoken at home, outside home, in its choice of\nnewspapers, and TV channels. Everyone finds to accomplish its need by the same\nway. Example includes the preference of using mobile phones in English. The\nsatisfactory answer to this tendency may be the lack of finding the\ntranslations in native language---Bengali terms used in current mobile phones\nare hard to understand by users. I have investigated various mobile phone\nmodels available in Indian market which have lot of problems in Bengali\ninterpretation. I have sort out the root cause of this problem to be the\nconventional accent understand ability. Depending on this I have created a set\nof equivalent terms that I hope to be simpler in use. In this paper I have\nperformed experiments to compare the new terms to the available ones. Our\nfindings show that the newly derived terms do better in term of performance\nthan to current ones. It has also been seen that acceptance of Bengali terms in\nmobile phones might grow if the parameter of simpler and conventional accent\nunderstand ability are met while designing."

    "summary": "Objective: Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leaves affected individuals unable\nto ambulate. Electroencephalogramme (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI)\ncontrolled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like\nambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested\na novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control\nof the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).\n  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following\n10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking\nkinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed\nto generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a\ngoal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the\nKMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops\nat designated points within the VRE.\n  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was\n77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),\nwith chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/-\n1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 sec completion time (perfect =\n211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those\nof random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.\n  Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode\nusers' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced\ncontrol of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve\nsuch BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of\nfuture BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible."

    "summary": "Context information brings new opportunities for efficient and effective\napplications and services on mobile devices. A wide range of research has\nexploited context dependency, i.e., the relations between context(s) and the\noutcome, to achieve significant, quantified, performance gains for a variety of\napplications. These works often have to deal with the challenges of multiple\nsources of context that can lead to a sparse training data set, and the\nchallenge of energy hungry context sensors. Often, they address these\nchallenges in an application specific and ad-hoc manner. We liberate mobile\napplication designers and researchers from these burdens by providing a\nmethodical approach to these challenges. In particular, we 1) define and\nmeasure the context-dependency of three fundamental types of mobile usage in an\napplication agnostic yet practical manner, which can provide clear insight into\nthe performance of potential ap-plication. 2) Address the challenge of data\nsparseness when dealing with multiple and different sources of context in a\nsystematic manner. 3) Present SmartContext to address the energy challenge by\nautomatically selecting among context sources while ensuring the minimum\naccuracy for each estimation event is met.\n  Our analysis and findings are based on usage and context traces collected in\nreal-life settings from 24 iPhone users over a period of one year. We present\nfindings regarding the context dependency of the three principal types of\nmobile usage; visited websites, phone calls, and app usage. Yet, our\nmethodology and the lessons we learn can be readily extended to other\ncontext-dependent mobile usage and system resources as well. Our findings guide\nthe development of context aware systems, and highlight the challenges and\nexpectations regarding the context dependency of mobile usage."

In the paper,\nit is submitted that these discourses could motivate IT professionals in\nundertaking alternative approaches toward the co-construction of\nsocio-technical systems, i.e., social settings where humans cooperate to reach\ncommon goals by means of mediating computational tools. The authors advocate\nfurther discussion about and consolidation of some concepts in design research,\ndesign practice and more generally Information Technology (IT) development,\nlike those of: task-artifact entanglement, universatility (sic) of End-User\nDevelopment (EUD) environments, bricolant/bricoleur end-user, logic of\nbricolage, maieuta-designers (sic), and laissez-faire method to socio-technical\nconstruction. Points backing these and similar concepts are made to promote\nfurther discussion on the need to rethink the main assumptions underlying IT\ndesign and development some fifty years later the coming of age of software and\nmodern IT in the organizational domain."

    "summary": "The paper is concerned with various ways of analysing the subjective\nassessment of displaying digital signage content. In the beginning the brief\ndescription of the signage system evolution is described and next, the carried\nout ex-periment is depicted. The preferences of the 32 subjects were obtained\nusing pairwise comparisons of the designed screen formats. Then the priorities\nwere derived by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1977; 1980)\nframework. The gathered data were modelled and analysed by means of the\nanalysis of variance, multiple regression, conjoint and factor analysis. The\nresults suggest that the application of different methods of preference\nanalysis may provide additional information, which could facilitate more\nin-depth understanding of the given preference structure."

    "summary": "In this paper, results of experimental research on the preattentive mechanism\nin the human-computer interaction (HCI) were presented. Fifty four subjects\nwere asked to find interface elements from various panel structures. The\narrangements were differentiated by their orientation (vertical, horizontal),\ncolour pattern (ordered, unordered) and object background colours (green-blue,\ngreen-red, blue-red). The main finding of the study generally confirms the\nprofits provided by the visual preattentive processing of the colour feature in\ngraphical panel operation efficiency. However, the vertical way of arranging\nthe items in search layouts resulted in decreasing the preattentive effect\nrelated to the item background colour. In regular, chessboard-like patterns of\ndifferent coloured items, the effect of the early vision was less salient than\nin the case of structures with randomly dispersed colours. The reported results\ncan help in designing efficient graphical user-computer interfaces in many\ninteractive information systems."

    "summary": "The main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of a computer\nscreen interface design and its related geometrical characteristics of 36\ngraphical objects on a user's task efficiency. A total of 490 subjects took\npart in laboratory experiments that focused on the direct manipulation of a\nvisual dialogue between a user and a computer. The subjects were asked to\nselect an object from among a group of items randomly placed on the computer\nscreen that were visible exclusively during the visual search process. A model\nexpressing the mean object acquisition time as a function of graphical object\nsize and the configuration was developed and statistically validated. The model\nshowed an influence of geometrical design characteristics of the graphical\nobjects (icons) and their groupings (icon structures) on the observed task\nefficiency. The reported results can be used at those stages of a software\nlifecycle that concentrate on prototyping, designing, and implementing\ngraphical solutions for the efficient graphical user-computer interface."

This study uses our own PHP, and MySQL based tool AWebHUT: Automated\nWeb Homepage Usability Tester to evaluate web usability of full Dmoz\n(www.dmoz.org) Asia web sites (45126 on time stamp 2011-12-03 04:12:46 GMT).\nThe tool uses an extensive automated quantitative analysis of XHTML source code\nof homepages against seventeen organised web usability guidelines. The\nautomated quantitative approach is effective on large scale to achieve better\nusability. The AWebHUT uses four web usability levels such as N: Neutral, V:\nViolate, R: Respect, and E: Error to evaluate web usability. The main objective\nof the study is to produce data which is used to answer research questions, (1)\nAre there any categories of web sites which have usability problems? Which\nones? and (2) Are there any categories in which the usability is typically\nhigher? Why? The findings were indicated that all Asia categories have\nusability problems. Furthermore, there are four web sites which have highest\nweb usability problem with violation percentage 71. One step further, the Asia\ncategory: Weather has highest usability problems with 42.2819 as the average of\nthe violation percentage. The category Weather uses tables and images,\nconsiderable amount of those were not satisfying web usability guidelines which\nrelates to tables and images. One step further, the Asia wants to get the same\nlevel of usability as North America, Europe, and Australia therefore it is\nessential to have an automated web usability evaluation in Asia web sites to\nidentify web usability problems which are important for improving Asia web\nsites."

We present a\nframework for building multi-platform, portable EEG applications with real-time\n3D source reconstruction. The system - Smartphone Brain Scanner - combines an\noff-the-shelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such\nrepresents the first fully mobile system for real-time 3D EEG imaging. We\ndiscuss the benefits and challenges of a fully portable system, including\ntechnical limitations as well as real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain\nactivity. We present examples of the brain activity captured in a simple\nexperiment involving imagined finger tapping, showing that the acquired signal\nin a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab\nequipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using a\noff-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower compared to that obtained using\nhigh density standard EEG equipment, we propose that mobile application\ndevelopment may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new\nopportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings."

    "summary": "Nowadays, the Web has become one of the most widespread platforms for\ninformation change and retrieval. As it becomes easier to publish documents, as\nthe number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of\ndocuments grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and\ntime-consuming operation. Because of the loose interconnection between\ndocuments, people have difficulty remembering where they have been and\nreturning to previously visited pages. Navigation through the web faces\nproblems of locating oneself with respect to space and time. The idea of\ngraphical assistance navigation is to help users to find their paths in\nhyperspace by adapting the style of link presentation to the goals, knowledge\nand other characteristics of an individual user. We first introduce the\nconcepts related to web navigation; we then present an overview of different\ngraphical navigation tools and techniques. We conclude by presenting a\ncomparative table of these tools based on some pertinent criteria."

    "summary": "Isabelle/PIDE is the current Prover IDE technology for Isabelle. It has been\ndeveloped in ML and Scala in the past 4-5 years for this particular proof\nassistant, but with an open mind towards other systems. PIDE is based on an\nasynchronous document model, where the prover receives edits continuously and\nupdates its internal state accordingly. The interpretation of edits and the\npolicies for proof document processing are determined by the prover. The editor\nfront-end merely takes care of visual rendering of formal document content.\n  Here we report on an experiment to connect Coq to the PIDE infrastructure of\nIsabelle. This requires to re-implement the core PIDE protocol layer of\nIsabelle/ML in OCaml. The payload for semantic processing of proof document\ncontent is restricted to lexical analysis in the sense of existing CoqIde\nfunctionality. This is sufficient as proof-of-concept for PIDE connectivity.\nActual proof processing is then a matter of improving Coq towards timeless and\nstateless proof processing, independently of PIDE technicalities. The\nimplementation worked out smoothly and required minimal changes to the refined\nPIDE architecture of Isabelle2013.\n  This experiment substantiates PIDE as general approach to prover interaction.\nIt illustrates how other provers of the greater ITP family can participate by\nfollowing similar reforms of the classic TTY loop as was done for Isabelle in\nthe past few years."

Despite this reality, the notion of 'design', and in\nparticular 'engineering design', is often ambiguous, and at times obscure.\nThus, the transfer of knowledge of this crucial topic to engineering students\nengaged in practical hands-on learning or analytical research is usually\nperplexing to accomplish. In light of this, it becomes worthwhile to dissect\nand reflect on the abstraction of the design process in engineering. In fact,\nthe aim of this article is to investigate the facets of applied design, and\nelaborate on its diversity, complexity and elements. Eventually, by\nconcretizing this subject matter, we hope to slightly assist engineering\nstudents in alleviating some of the vagueness associated with the principle of\ndesign, and enhance their technical skillset during innovative conceptions."

    "summary": "Whenever a visualization researcher is asked about the purpose of\nvisualization, the phrase \"gaining insight\" by and large pops out\ninstinctively. However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of\nvisualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is\nbroadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of\na visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained,\nhow much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that \"saving time\" in\naccomplishing a user's task is the most fundamental objective. By giving\nemphasis to saving time, we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate\nunnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and\nstimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as\nempirical studies, design optimisation and theories of visualization."

    "summary": "Communities present considerable challenges for the design and application of\nsupportive information technology (IT), especially when these develop in\nloosely-integrated, informal and scarcely organized contexts, like it is often\nthe case of Communities of Practice (CoP). An approach that actively supports\nuser communities in the process of IT appropriation can help alleviate the\nimpossibility of the members of these communities to rely on professional\nsupport, and enable even complex forms of tailoring and End-User Development\n(EUD). Although this approach has been already explored by an increasing number\nof researchers, however there is still a lack of a general framework that could\nplay a role in the comparison of existing proposals and in the development of\nnew EUD solutions for CoPs. The paper proposes a conceptual framework and a\nrelated architecture, called Logic of Bricolage, that aims to be a step further\nin this direction to enable better EUD-oriented support for digitized\ncommunities. The framework is described and the architecture instantiated in\nthree concrete EUD environments that specifically regard collaborative\nactivities in order to show the generality and applicability of the framework."

    "summary": "Aesthetics are often used to evaluate the quality of graph drawings. However,\nthe existing aesthetic criteria are useful in judging the extents to which a\ndrawing conforms to particular drawing rules. They have limitations in\nevaluating overall quality. Currently the overall quality of graph drawings is\nmainly evaluated based on personal judgments and user studies. Personal\njudgments are not reliable, while user studies can be costly to run. Therefore,\nthere is a need for a direct measure of overall quality. This measure can be\nused by visualization designers to quickly compare the quality of drawings at\nhand at the design stage and make decisions accordingly. In an attempt to meet\nthis need, we propose a measure that measures overall quality based on\naggregation of individual aesthetic criteria. We present a user study that\nvalidates this measure and demonstrates its capacity in predicting the\nperformance of human graph comprehension. The implications of the proposed\nmeasure for future research are discussed."

    "summary": "Performing controlled user experiments on small devices in naturalistic\nmobile settings has always proved to be a difficult undertaking for many Human\nFactors researchers. Difficulties exist, not least, because mimicking natural\nsmall device usage suffers from a lack of unobtrusive data to guide\nexperimental design, and then validate that the experiment is proceeding\nnaturally.Here we use observational data to derive a set of protocols and a\nsimple checklist of validations which can be built into the design of any\ncontrolled experiment focused on the user interface of a small device. These,\nhave been used within a series of experimental designs to measure the utility\nand application of experimental software. The key-point is the validation\nchecks -- based on the observed behaviour of 400 mobile users -- to ratify that\na controlled experiment is being perceived as natural by the user. While the\ndesign of the experimental route which the user follows is a major factor in\nthe experimental setup, without check validations based on unobtrusive observed\ndata there can be no certainty that an experiment designed to be natural is\nactually progressing as the design implies."

In\norder to help developers choose ideas that meet the end users' needs, we\nundertook a massive collaborative research effort and collected 40000 ideas\nfrom 2150 common people about future mobile services that they would like to\nuse. We inspired each people to produce tens of mobile service ideas. In this\npaper we carry out an analysis for 4000 ideas from the idea database. We had a\nparticular interest in whether peoples' ideas can be used in foreseeing the\ntechnology development needs. The results show that end users produce ideas\nthat are conservative more than novel. Therefore, we claim that consumers'\ntechnology foresight horizon is limited by the existing technological base. The\nsecond finding, linked to the previous one, is that the great majority of the\nideas that consumers expressed could be realised utilizing existing\ntechnologies. The implication of this finding is that the idea database should\nbe an interesting source of ideas for service developers. The third finding of\nthe study, related to the methodology, is that a vast number of ideas can be\ncollected fairly easily but analyzing them cost effectively is a challenge."

    "summary": "Before the computer age, games were played in the physical world where\nplayers would have to interact with real objects and each other, triggering a\nseries of emotions. Nowadays, the computer games have become one of the most\npopular forms of entertainment due to their high-level of attraction and\naccessibility. However, the game industry is always trying to find new ways of\nmaking games more interactive and exciting in order to attract new players, and\none of the recent trends on the area of human-computer interaction is\nBiofeedback.\n  The goal of this dissertation is to study different approaches on the use of\nindirect biofeedback within videogames, with the purpose of creating a better\nhuman-computer interaction, and provide a more appealing and immersive user\nexperience. For this, we focused on the development of a framework capable of\ntesting different indirect biofeedback models within a specified game, in order\nto assess the effect of each of these variations on the user experience. This\nframework is game independent, with the intention of being used on further\nstudies."

    "summary": "A conventional computer keyboard consists of as many as 101 keys. The\nkeyboard has several sections, such as text entry section, navigation section,\nand numeric keypad etc. and each having several keys on the keyboard.\n  The size of the keyboard is a major inconvenience for portable computers, as\nthey cannot be carried easily. Thus there are certain circumstances which\ncompels to reduce the size of a keyboard.\n  Reducing the size of a keyboard leads to several problems. A reduced size\nkeyboard may not contain all the keys available on a full size keyboard; a\nreduced size keyboard may not be convenient to operate, a reduced size keyboard\nmay have a different key layout which is difficult to learn etc.\n  This article illustrates 10 inventions on reducing the size of the keyboard.\nVarious inventions have attempted to solve the contradictions so that the user\nachieves the benefits of both \"reduced size\" and \"typing comfort\"."

Hiragana is used to spell words of Japanese\norigin, while Katakana is used to spell words of western or other foreign\norigin.\n  Two methods are commonly used to input Japanese to the computer. One, the\n'kana input method' that uses a keyboard having 46 Japanese iroha (or kana)\nletter keys. The other method is 'Roma-ji input method', where the Japanese\nletters are composed of English input from a standard QWERTY keyboard. Both the\nmethods have their advantages and disadvantages.\n  This article analyses two inventions on inputting Japanese language through a\ncomputer keyboard. One invention uses a standard English keyboard to input\nJapanese characters, the other invention uses a standard mobile phone key board\nto input the Japanese characters."

    "summary": "The popularity of touchscreen phones has been growing around the world since\nthe iPhones and Android phones were released. More and more mobile phones with\nlarge touchscreen have been produced, however, the phones with small size\ndisplays are still in the majority of touch phones. The foremost interface on\ntouch smartphones is the information input module using soft keyboards.\nTraditional input methods on touch phones have either too small key buttons\n(such as QWERTY) or too many functions (such as 3$\\times$4 keyboard), which are\ninconvenient to use. Moreover, the conventional soft keyboards only use tapping\nto input texts while current touch smartphones allow various gestures on the\ntouchscreen, such as sliding. In this paper, a novel soft keyboard called QWERT\nis proposed for touchscreen-based smartphones. The users can interact with\nphones via finger gestures of tapping or sliding when input text by using the\nQWERT. In doing so, the interactions between users and smartphones will be\nfaster and easier. An experiment carried out on inexperienced human subjects\nshows that they can learn very fast due to their familiarities with QWERTY. A\nsimulation experiment based on a cognitive architecture, ACT-R, was also\nconducted to predict the movement time (MT) of experienced human subjects. The\nsimulation results show that the MT using QWERT outperforms other default\nkeyboards. These outcomes imply that the novel QWERT is a viable option for\ntouch smartphone users. Based on the novel design, an application is released\non Android systems. This application is expected to give better user experience\nfor customers who use touch smartphones."

However, traditional evaluation\nmethods may fail to combine real-time measures, an \"objective\" approach and\ndata contextualization. In this review we look at how adding neuroimaging\ntechniques can respond to such needs. We focus on electroencephalography (EEG),\nas it could be handled effectively during a dedicated evaluation phase. We\nidentify workload, attention, vigilance, fatigue, error recognition, emotions,\nengagement, flow and immersion as being recognizable by EEG. We find that\nworkload, attention and emotions assessments would benefit the most from EEG.\nMoreover, we advocate to study further error recognition through neuroimaging\nto enhance usability and increase user experience."

I start with history from a personal\nperspective, concentrating on the debate between the \"Virtual Reality\" and\n\"Virtual Environment\" labels in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Definitions\nof VR based on specific technologies are shown to be unsatisfactory. I propose\nthe following definition of VR, based on the striking effects of a good VR\nsystem: \"Virtual Reality is the use of computer technology to create the effect\nof an interactive three-dimensional world in which the objects have a sense of\nspatial presence.\" The justification for this definition is discussed in\ndetail, and is favorably compared with the dictionary definitions of \"virtual\"\nand \"reality\".

Our\ntestbed system addresses these limitations by a combination of sensors,\nsoftware filters, architectural components and a RESTful API to track\ninteraction events in real-time, and retrieve current state and historical data\nto learn patterns and recommend user actions. We evaluate the accuracy and\noverhead of our system in a realistic interaction flow. The accuracy was\nmeasured to 83-88% and the overhead compared to a representative\nstate-of-the-art barcode scanner improved by 27%. We also showcase two\napplications built on top of our testbed, one for finding expired items and\ningredients of dishes; and one to monitor your health. The pattern that these\napplications have in common is that they cast the interaction as an\nitem-recommendation problem triggered when the user takes something out. Our\ntestbed could help reveal further user-experience centric interaction patterns\nand new classes of applications for smart fridges that inherently, by relying\non our testbed primitives, mitigate the issues with existing approaches."

    "summary": "The mechanism of communication between users and devices is called interface.\nFrom time to time changes in interface significantly improve our work with\ncomputers even without any serious changes in programs themselves. Main ideas\nin PCs interface were introduced many years ago and since then there are no\nsignificant changes, while new devices show promising ways by using direct\nmanipulation of screen objects. Users' direct action with all the screen\nobjects of our ordinary PCs turns standard screens into touch screens of very\nhigh resolution and not only changes the interface of familiar programs but\ncreates the new type of programs: user-driven applications."

    "summary": "Keyboard, although a popular medium, is not very convenient as it requires a\ncertain amount of skill for effective usage. A mouse on the other hand requires\na good hand-eye co-ordination. Also current computer interfaces also assume a\ncertain level of literacy from the user. It also expect the user to have\ncertain level of proficiency in English. In our country where the literacy\nlevel is as low as 50% in some states, if information technology has to reach\nthe grass root level; these constraints have to be eliminated. As a solution\nfor these, Speech Recognition and hence the concept of Voice operated computer\nsystem comes into picture. In this paper we propose a technique to develop a\nvoice recognition system which will be used for controlling computer via speech\ninput from any user i.e. without the use of mouse and / or keyboard. Once\ndeveloped this system would be of great benefit to physically handicapped\npeople as Instead of scrolling through written procedures on a laptop or\nhandheld computer, they can wear a headset and have their hands and eyes free."

    "summary": "In decision making a key source of uncertainty is people's perception of\ninformation which is influenced by their attitudes toward risk. Both,\nperception of information and risk attitude, affect the interpretation of\ninformation and hence the choice of suitable courses of action in a variety of\ncontexts ranging from project planning to military operations. Visualization\nassociated with the dynamics of cognitive states of people processing\ninformation and making decision is therefore not only important for analysis\nbut has also significant practical applications, in particular in the military\ncommand and control domain. In this paper, we focus on a major concept that\naffect human cognition in this context: reliability of information. We\nintroduce Cognitive Move Diagrams (CMD)---a simple visualization tool---to\nrepresent and evaluate the impact of this concept on decision making. We\ndemonstrate through both a hypothetical example and a subject matter expert\nbased experiment that CMD are effective in visualizing, detecting and\nqualifying human biases."

    "summary": "Task taxonomies for graph and network visualizations focus on tasks commonly\nencountered when analyzing graph connectivity and topology. However, in many\napplication fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology\n(protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs),\nconnectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering,\nand hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as\nBubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering,\nbut evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of\nstandardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new\nset of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of\ngroup-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we\ncharacterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of\nabstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the\ntask taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for\nthe recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and\ncategorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected\nin controlled experiments."

    "summary": "When users search for the routes between two places using map based services,\nthese services compute and provide the top candidate routes based on shortest\ngeometric distances or ideal time consuming. However, other real factors like\nphysical exertion and practical time consuming will influence user experience,\nand the environmental factors like steep slope and traffic jam that result in\nthese real factors need to be considered. For example, when users travel on\nfoot or by bicycle, if there are many steep slopes on the routes, it will be\ndifficult or easy to be tired. In this paper, we propose an approach computing\nweighted distance considering these environmental factors. We rank the\ncandidate route results generated by Google Map using elevation information. We\nintegrate the elevation information in the route results to assist users to\nmake decision. The solution can also be used in other scenarios that need to\nconsider environmental factors."

    "summary": "Effectively showing the relationships between objects in a dataset is one of\nthe main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined\nnotion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as\nprincipal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the\nobjects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other.\nIn another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where\nrelated nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also\nvisualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit\nrepresentation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques,\ncharacterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information:\nnode diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these\nthree types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different\ntasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based\ntasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links\nand group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and\naccuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not\nnegatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group\ndiagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions\ncontradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings.\nTaken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the\ndesign of standard and domain specific visualizations tools."

It could cause\nimportant stress outside the \"zone of comfort\", when stereoscopic effect is too\nstrong. This conflict has already been studied using questionnaires, during\nviewing sessions of several minutes. The present pilot study describes an\nexperimental protocol which compares two different comfort conditions using\nelectroencephalography (EEG) over short viewing sequences. Analyses showed\nsignificant differences both in event-related potentials (ERP) and in frequency\nbands power. An uncomfortable stereoscopy correlates with a weaker negative\ncomponent and a delayed positive component in ERP. It also induces a power\ndecrease in the alpha band and increases in theta and beta bands. With fast\nresponses to stimuli, EEG is likely to enable the conception of adaptive\nsystems, which could tune the stereoscopic experience according to each viewer."

    "summary": "The menu is one of the most widely used elements of a graphical user\ninterface. The objective of a menu system is to provide various commands and\nfunctions to the user in an easy way so that the user can just select the\ndesired operation from a given list instead of typing a complex command in the\ncommand prompt.\n  In a conventional menu system the menu items or options are hard-coded in the\ncomputer program. The programmer or developer composes menu items at the time\nof development. The developer tries to include all options that he feels may be\nrequired by the user in future. Although the items are decided from\n\"requirement analysis\" and other studies, it is difficult to know the exact\nneed of a user at a future period of time. This leads to inclusion of a lot of\nitems in the menu, which leads to user confusion and frustration.\n  Thus there is a need for adaptable menu that can be changed according to user\nrequirement. The items of the adaptable menu should change from user to user\nand from time to time depending on the program context and likelihood of user\nselection.\n  This article defines the Ideal Final Result of a dropdown menu system,\ndefines the desirable functions of an adaptable menu, finds and solves the\ncontradictions faced in achieving the desirable functions, and illustrates six\nselected cases on adaptable menu from US patent database."

    "summary": "Scrolling mechanism is used to display and edit large documents in a limited\nscreen space or window. The scrolling mechanism may include a vertical scroll\nbar or a horizontal scroll bar or both to move the contents of the documents up\nand down or left and right. There may be navigation buttons on the screen\nrepresenting the navigation keys on the keyboard. The user can click these\nbuttons to scroll the screen.\n  There may be very different methods of scrolling such as by using the\n\"thumb\", as popularly used with a PDF document. Scrolling may be achieved\nthrough eyeball tracking in a hands-free environment where the user does not\nhave hands or wants to use hands for other activities. This article illustrates\nten interesting inventions on scrolling selected from US patent database."

    "summary": "The dialog boxes are useful in case of displaying warnings, errors,\nconfirmations etc. in special situations. A typical dialog box is displayed in\na small window with some text message along with a few options for the user to\nselect. However, there are certain difficulties associated in programming and\nimplementing a conventional dialog box, such as, severe programming effort,\nrigidity of the hard coded message, obscuring screen space and so on. There is\na need to overcome these difficulties of the dialog box to make them more\nefficient and useful.\n  The modality of the dialog boxes also creates some limitations. While modal\ndialog boxes needs to be closed explicitly by the user, modeless dialog boxes\ncan grow in number and become difficult to control. Thus, an ideal dialog box\nshould be deprived of all the above-mentioned drawbacks. The dialog box should\nnot obscure the screen. The user should be able open multiple dialog boxes but\nwithout obscuring the screen.\n  This article analyses 5 interesting inventions on dialog boxes selected from\nUS Patent database. Each invention tries to overcome some limitations of a\nconventional dialog box and provides some innovative features. Each solution is\nalso analyzed from a TRIZ perspective."

    "summary": "A touch sensitive screen displays the information on the screen and also\nreceives the input by sensing a user's touch on the same screen. This mechanism\nfacilitates system interaction directly through the screen without needing a\nmouse or keyboard. This method has the advantage to make the system compact by\nremoving keyboard, mouse and similar interactive device.\n  However there are certain difficulties to implement a touch screen interface.\nThe display screens of portable devices are becoming smaller thereby leaving\nlesser space for display of data, menu or touch screen interaction. Besides\nsome screens need to display so much of information that they hardly can afford\nany space to display touch screen buttons.

    "summary": "Windows are used quite frequently in a GUI environment. The greatest\nadvantage of using windows is that each window creates a virtual screen space.\nHence, although the physical screen space is limited to a few inches, use of\nwindows can create unlimited screen space to display innumerable items.\n  The use of windows facilitates the user to open and interact with multiple\nprograms or documents simultaneously in different windows. Sometimes a single\nprogram may also open multiple windows to display various items. The user can\nresize the windows and move their location time to time as desired.\n  However, there are several concerns of a window relating to its size,\nappearance, positioning, color, visibility, resizability etc. For example, the\nwindow should have a minimum and a maximum size, dragging and resizing the\nwindow should be easy, one window should not be obscured by another window,\nwindows should adjust their size and location in order to match with the\nchanges in the resolution and display environment etc.\n  This article illustrates six patents from US Patent database solving problems\nrelating to displaying and resizing of windows. The inventions include\nautomatic resizing and relocating of windows, alternative modes of displaying\nwindows to accommodate within the limited display area, combining both spatial\nand temporal methods to resize the window, locking and minimizing windows and\nmaking the windows invisible on specific situations."

    "summary": "This article presents two studies conducted with an affective dialogue system\nin which text-based system-user communication was used to model, generate, and\npresent different affective and social interaction scenarios. We specifically\ninvestigated the influence of interaction context and roles assigned to the\nsystem and the participants, as well as the impact of pre-structured social\ninteraction patterns that were modelled to mimic aspects of 'social exclusion'\nscenarios. The results of the first study demonstrate that both the social\ncontext of the interaction and the roles assigned to the system influence the\nsystem evaluation, interaction patterns, textual expressions of affective\nstates, as well as emotional self-reports. The results observed for the second\nstudy show the system's ability to partially exclude a participant from a\ntriadic conversation without triggering significantly different affective\nreactions or a more negative system evaluation. The experimental evidence\nprovides insights on the perception, modelling and generation of affective and\nsocial cues in artificial systems that can be realized in different modalities,\nincluding the text modality, thus delivering valuable input for applying\naffective dialogue systems as tools for studying affect and social aspects in\nonline communication."

Often the same functions are provided through both menu and toolbar.\n  Both toolbar and dropdown menu have their own advantages and disadvantages. A\nmenu can provide more options occupying less real estate, while toolbar can\nprovide a single click access without navigating through trees and branches.\n  As a menu and toolbar system shares many common objectives, it is often\nuseful maintain some relationship to coordinate between both the elements of a\nGUI system. The relationships can be easy as both of them often share the same\ninternal function. For example, the print option in a menu will (most likely)\ncall the same function as the print button on the toolbar.\n  This article discusses the similarities and differences between a dropdown\nmenu and toolbar.

The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging\nand dropping objects from one location to another. It saves user from\nremembering and typing a lot of commands.\n  The result of a drag and drop operation may vary depending the type of source\nobject and type of destination object. For example dragging a file and dropping\non a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, dropping that\nfile to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, dropping\nthat file on a printer icon may print that file, dropping that file on the\ntrash can may delete that file, and dropping that file on an executable may\nplay or open or compute or manipulate that file.\n  Although a drag and drop operation prima facie seems to be a simple\noperation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source\nobjects dragged and the type of destination objects selected for dropping.\nThere are many limitations of a conventional drag and drop operation.

    "summary": "In recent years, the use of the automobile as the primary mode of\ntransportation has been increasing and driving has become an important part of\ndaily life. Driving is a multi-sensory experience as drivers rely on their\nsenses to provide them with important information. In a vehicular context human\nsenses are all too often limited and obstructed. Today, road accidents\nconstitute the eighth leading cause of death. The escalation of technology has\npropelled new ways in which driver's senses may be augmented. The enclosed\naspect of a car, allied with the configuration of the controls and displays\ndirected towards the driver, offer significant advantages for augmented reality\n(AR) systems when considering the amount of immersion it can provide to the\nuser. In addition, the inherent mobility and virtually unlimited power autonomy\ntransform cars into perfect mobile computing platforms. However, automobiles\ncurrently present limited network connectivity and thus the created augmented\nobjects are merely providing information captured by in-vehicle sensors,\ncameras and other databases. By combining the new paradigm of Vehicular Ad Hoc\nNetworking (VANET) with AR human machine interfaces, we show that it is\npossible to design novel cooperative Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),\nthat base the creation of AR content on the information collected from\nneighbouring vehicles or roadside infrastructures. As such we implement\nprototypes of both visual and acoustic AR systems, which can significantly\nimprove the driving experience. We believe our results contribute to the\nformulation of a vision where the vehicle is perceived as an extension of the\nbody which permeates the human senses to the world outside the vessel, where\nthe car is used as a better, multi-sensory immersive version of a mobile phone\nthat integrates touch, vision and sound enhancements, leveraging unique\nproperties of VANET."

    "summary": "We describe a completely automated large scale visual recommendation system\nfor fashion. Existing approaches have primarily relied on purely computational\nmodels to solving this problem that ignore the role of users in the system. In\nthis paper, we propose to overcome this limitation by incorporating a\nuser-centric design of visual fashion recommendations. Specifically, we propose\na technique that augments 'user preferences' in models by exploiting elasticity\nin fashion choices. We further design a user study on these choices and gather\nresults from the 'wisdom of crowd' for deeper analysis. Our key insights learnt\nthrough these results suggest that fashion preferences when constrained to a\nparticular class, contain important behavioral signals that are often ignored\nin recommendation design. Further, presence of such classes also reflect strong\ncorrelations to visual perception which can be utilized to provide\naesthetically pleasing user experiences. Finally, we illustrate that user\napproval of visual fashion recommendations can be substantially improved by\ncarefully incorporating these user-centric feedback into the system framework."

    "summary": "As people become more concerned with the need to conserve their power\nconsumption we need to find ways to inform them of how electricity is being\nconsumed within the home. There are a number of devices that have been designed\nusing different forms, sizes, and technologies. We are interested in large\nambient displays that can be read at a glance and from a distance as\ninformative art. However, from these objectives come a number of questions that\nneed to be explored and answered. To what degree might lifestyle factors\ninfluence the design of eco-visualizations? To answer this we need to ask how\npeople with varying lifestyle factors perceive the utility of such devices and\ntheir placement within a home. We explore these questions by creating four\nambient display prototypes. We take our prototypes and subject them to a user\nstudy to gain insight as to the questions posed above. This paper discusses our\nprototypes in detail and the results and findings of our user study."

    "summary": "A graph is a mathematical object consisting of a set of vertices and a set of\nedges connecting vertices. Graphs can be drawn on paper in various ways, but\nuntil recently all published methods of drawing graphs have had undesirable\nproperties: (i) for graphs which are not plane embeddable, intersections\nbetween the lines representing edges appear at points which are not vertices,\ncreating the appearance of vertices where none exist, (ii) vertex labels can be\nplaced inside vertex symbols, but there is no consistent, logical, and visually\nclean place to put edge labels, and (iii) representations of large graphs are\nvisually dense and difficult to interpret. This paper describes a new\ncartographic method of drawing graphs which solves all of these problems, and\nhas other advantages as well. Complements, comparisons and contrasts of graphs\nare usually better shown cartographically than in node-link form."

    "summary": "Prototyping is an important part in research and development of tangible user\ninterfaces (TUIs). On the way from the idea to a working prototype, new\nhardware prototypes usually have to be crafted repeatedly in numerous\niterations. This brings us to think about virtual prototypes that exhibit the\nsame functionality as a real TUI, but reduce the amount of time and resources\nthat have to be spent.\n  Building upon existing open-source software - the middleware Robot Operating\nSystem (ROS) and the 3D simulator Gazebo - we have created a toolkit that can\nbe used for developing and testing fully functional implementations of a\ntangible user interface as a virtual device. The entire interaction between the\nTUI and other hardware and software components is controlled by the middleware,\nwhile the human interaction with the TUI can be explored using the 3D simulator\nand 3D input/output technologies. We argue that by simulating parts of the\nhardware-software co-design process, the overall development effort can be\nreduced."

    "summary": "(arXiv abridged abstract) In the last two decades, videogames have evolved in\na nearly explosive way from the pixelated graphics to today's near-realistic 3D\nenvironments. The interaction devices traditionally used in videogames have not\nevolved with the same intensity, but recent HCI studies have explored\nbiofeedback interaction - the explicit manipulation of a person's physiological\ndata as input to a system - as an alternative to them. Traditional biofeedback\nprototypes apply 1 sensor to each game mechanic (unimodality).\n  In this dissertation, we introduce the combination of 2 physiological sensors\nsimultaneously per game mechanic (multimodality) and present a First-Person\nShooter game comprised of 8 game mechanics with three interaction flavours (no\nbiofeedback/vanilla, unimodal and multimodal). An empirical study with 32\nregular players was employed to explore and study differences between the three\ninteraction types and where they can be best employed.\n  Players compared the three games in terms of Fun, Ease of Use, Originality,\nPlayability and Favourite Condition. For the sake of completeness, other\nevaluation methods were used as well: IMI Questionnaire, keywords association\nand open-ended commentaries. The vanilla version was considered easier to use,\nbut both biofeedback versions were considered the most fun. Both versions were\npraised differently: the unimodal version for its simplicity of use, and the\nmultimodal for its realism, activation safety of game mechanics and depth added\nto the game. Our conclusion is that multimodal biofeedback can have a relevant\nimpact in terms of added depth, depending on the way it is used inside the\ngame. On a boundary case, it can be used to increase the feeling of empowerment\non the player when using certain abilities, or to intentionally make in-game\nactions more difficult by demanding more physical effort from the player."

    "summary": "Recent developments in sensing technologies, mobile devices and context-aware\nuser interfaces have made it possible to represent information fusion and\nsituational awareness as a conversational process among actors - human and\nmachine agents - at or near the tactical edges of a network. Motivated by use\ncases in the domain of security, policing and emergency response, this paper\npresents an approach to information collection, fusion and sense-making based\non the use of natural language (NL) and controlled natural language (CNL) to\nsupport richer forms of human-machine interaction. The approach uses a\nconversational protocol to facilitate a flow of collaborative messages from NL\nto CNL and back again in support of interactions such as: turning eyewitness\nreports from human observers into actionable information (from both trained and\nuntrained sources); fusing information from humans and physical sensors (with\nassociated quality metadata); and assisting human analysts to make the best use\nof available sensing assets in an area of interest (governed by management and\nsecurity policies). CNL is used as a common formal knowledge representation for\nboth machine and human agents to support reasoning, semantic information fusion\nand generation of rationale for inferences, in ways that remain transparent to\nhuman users. Examples are provided of various alternative styles for user\nfeedback, including NL, CNL and graphical feedback. A pilot experiment with\nhuman subjects shows that a prototype conversational agent is able to gather\nusable CNL information from untrained human subjects."

    "summary": "Multimodality can make (especially mobile) device interaction more efficient.\nSensors and communication capabilities of modern smartphones and tablets lay\nthe technical basis for its implementation. Still, mobile platforms do not make\nmultimodal interaction support trivial. Building multimodal applications\nrequires various APIs with different paradigms, high-level interpretation of\ncontextual data, and a method for fusing individual inputs and outputs. To\nreduce this effort, we created a framework that simplifies and accelerates the\ncreation of multimodal applications for prototyping and research. It provides\nan abstraction of information representations in different modalities, unifies\naccess to implicit and explicit information, and wires together the logic\nbehind context-sensitive modality switches. In the paper, we present the\nstructure and features of our framework, and validate it by four implemented\ndemonstrations of different complexity."

    "summary": "Fashion, and especially apparel, is the fastest-growing category in online\nshopping. As consumers requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods\nfor which their appearance matters most, images play a key role not only in\nconveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but also in\naffecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However,\nresearch related to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at\nperceptual level, but not the quality of content, and the way of presenting.\nThis study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image in showcasing\nfashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw\nconsumer's attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply\nadvanced vision technique to quantize attractiveness using three common display\ntypes in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin, and flat. We perform\ntwo-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online\nmarket, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our\nunderstandings on consumer's reasoning logic behind the action. We propose a\nFisher noncentral hypergeometric distribution based user choice model to\nquantitatively evaluate user's preference. Further, we investigate the\npotentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's\npreference. A visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates\nboth presentation efficacy and user preference is proposed. We show\nquantitative improvement by promoting visual attractiveness into search on top\nof relevance."

Admittance of such Web pages on Small Screen Devices (SSDs) like\nmobile phones, palmtops, tablets, PDA etc., is increasing with the support of\nthe current wireless technologies. However, SSDs have limited screen size,\nmemory capacity and bandwidth, which makes accessing the Website on SSDs\nextremely difficult. There are many approaches have been proposed in literature\nto regenerate HTML Web pages suitable for browsing on SSDs. These proposed\nmethods involve segment the Web page based on its semantic structure, followed\nby noise removal based on block features and to utilize the hierarchy of the\ncontent element to regenerate a page suitable for Small Screen Devices. But\nWorld Wide Web consortium stated that, HTML does not provide a better\ndescription of semantic structure of the web page contents. To overcome this\ndraw backs, Web developers started to develop Web pages using new technologies\nlike XML, Flash etc. It makes a way for new research methods. Therefore, we\nrequire an approach to reconstruct these Web pages suitable for SSDs. However,\nexisting approaches in literature do not perform well for Web pages erected\nusing XML and Flash. In this paper, we have emphasized a few issues of the\nexisting approaches on XML, Flash Datasets and propose an approach that\nperforms better on data set comprising of Flash Web pages."

    "summary": "Using current sensing technology, a wealth of data on driving sessions is\npotentially available through a combination of vehicle sensors and drivers'\nphysiology sensors (heart rate, breathing rate, skin temperature, etc.). Our\nhypothesis is that it should be possible to exploit the combination of time\nseries produced by such multiple sensors during a driving session, in order to\n(i) learn models of normal driving behaviour, and (ii) use such models to\ndetect important and potentially dangerous deviations from the norm in\nreal-time, and thus enable the generation of appropriate alerts. Crucially, we\nbelieve that such models and interventions should and can be personalised and\ntailor-made for each individual driver. As an initial step towards this goal,\nin this paper we present techniques for assessing the impact of cognitive\ndistraction on drivers, based on simple time series analysis. We have tested\nour method on a rich dataset of driving sessions, carried out in a professional\nsimulator, involving a panel of volunteer drivers. Each session included a\ndifferent type of cognitive distraction, and resulted in multiple time series\nfrom a variety of on-board sensors as well as sensors worn by the driver.\nCrucially, each driver also recorded an initial session with no distractions.\nIn our model, such initial session provides the baseline times series that make\nit possible to quantitatively assess driver performance under distraction\nconditions."

    "summary": "This article presents the mathematical background of general interactive\nsystems. The first principle of designing a large system is to _divide and\nconquer_, which implies that we could possibly reduce human error if we divided\na large system in smaller subsystems. Interactive systems are, however, often\ncomposed of many subsystems that are _organically_ connected to one another and\nthus difficult to divide. In other words, we cannot apply a framework of set\ntheory to the programming of interactive systems. We can overcome this\ndifficulty by applying a framework of category theory (Kleisli category) to the\nprogramming, but this requires highly abstract mathematics, which is not very\npopular. In this article we introduce the fundamental idea of category theory\nusing only lambda calculus, and then demonstrate how it can be used in the\npractical design of an interactive system. Finally, we mention how this\ndiscussion relates to category theory."

These objectives are frequently at odds with one\nanother. For instance, how much time should workers be given to discover and\npropose new solutions versus deliberate over those currently proposed? How do\nwe determine if discovering a new answer is appropriate at all? And how do we\nmanage workers who lack the expertise or attention needed to provide useful\ninput to a given task? We present a mechanism that uses distinct payoffs for\nthree possible worker actions---propose,vote, or abstain---to provide workers\nwith the necessary incentives to guarantee an effective (or even optimal)\nbalance between searching for new answers, assessing those currently available,\nand, when they have insufficient expertise or insight for the task at hand,\nabstaining. We provide a novel game theoretic analysis for this mechanism and\ntest it experimentally on an image---labeling problem and show that it allows a\nsystem to reliably control the balance betweendiscovering new answers and\nconverging to existing ones."

Initially there were keyboard, mouse etc. but with the advancement of\ntechnology, new ways are being discovered that are quite usual and natural to\nthe humans like stylus, touch-enable systems. In the current age of technology,\nuser is expected to touch the machine interface to give input. Hand gesture is\nsuch a way to interact with machines where natural bare hand is used to\ncommunicate without touching machine interface. It gives a feeling to user that\nhe is interacting in natural way to some human, not with traditional machines.\nThis paper presents a technique where user needs not to touch the machine\ninterface to draw on screen. Here hand finger draws shapes on monitor like\nstylus, without touching the monitor. This method can be used in many\napplications including games. The finger was used as an input device that acts\nlike paint-brush or finger-stylus and is used to make shapes in front of the\ncamera. Fingertip extraction and motion tracking were done in Matlab with real\ntime constraints. This work is an early attempt to replace stylus with the\nnatural finger without touching screen."

    "summary": "With the explosion of social media in the last few years, web pages nowadays\ninclude different social network buttons where users can express if they\nsupport or recommend content. Those social buttons are very visual and their\npresentations, along with the counters, mark the importance of the social\nnetwork and the interest on the content. In this paper, we analyze the presence\nof four types of social buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Google+1, and LinkedIn) in\na large collection of web pages that we tracked over a period of time. We\nreport on the distribution and counts along with some characteristics per\ndomain. Finally, we outline some research directions."

    "summary": "In a few months the computer mouse will be half-a-century-old. It is known to\nhave many drawbacks, the main ones being: loss of productivity due to constant\nswitching between keyboard and mouse, and health issues such as RSI. Like the\nkeyboard, it is an unnatural human-computer interface. However the vast\nmajority of computer users still use computer mice nowadays.\n  In this article, we explore computer mouse alternatives. Our research shows\nthat moving the mouse cursor can be done efficiently with camera-based head\ntracking system such as the SmartNav device, and mouse clicks can be emulated\nin many complementary ways. We believe that computer users can increase their\nproductivity and improve their long-term health by using these alternatives."

    "summary": "Traditional artworks like paintings, photographs, or films can be reproduced\nby conventional media like printing or video. This makes visitors of museums\npossible to purchase postcards, posters, books, and DVDs of pictures and/or\nmovies shown at the exhibition. However, newly developing arts so called\ninteractive art, or new media art, has not been able to be reproduced due to\nlimitation of functionalities of the conventional media. In this article, the\nauthors report a novel approach of sharing such interactive art outside the\nexhibition, so that the visitors of the museum can take a copy to home, and\neven share it with non-visitors. The authors build up their new\nprojector-and-camera (ProCam) based interactive artwork for exhibition at\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Tokyo (MOT) by using Apple's iPhone. The exactly\nsame software driving this artwork was downloadable from Apple's App Store --\nthus all visitors or even non-visitors could enjoy the same experience at home\nor wherever they like."

    "summary": "With the growing technology, we humans always need something that stands out\nfrom the other thing. Gestures are most desirable source to Communicate with\nthe Machines. Human Computer Interaction finds its importance when it comes to\nworking with the Human gestures to control the computer applications. Usually\nwe control the applications using mouse, keyboard, laser pointers etc. but,\nwith the recent advent in the technology it has even left behind their usage by\nintroducing more efficient techniques to control applications. There are many\nGesture Recognition techniques that have been implemented using image\nprocessing in the past.\n  However recognizing the gestures in the noisy background has always been a\ndifficult task to achieve. In the proposed system, we are going to use one such\ntechnique called Augmentation in Image processing to control Media Player. We\nwill recognize Gestures using which we are going to control the operations on\nMedia player. Augmentation usually is one step ahead when it comes to virtual\nreality. It has no restrictions on the background. Moreover it also does not\nrely on certain things like gloves, color pointers etc. for recognizing the\ngesture. This system mainly appeals to those users who always looks out for a\nbetter option that makes their interaction with computer more simpler or\neasier."

Our results show that we can achieve a\nclassification accuracy of 91% while classifying four gestures across six\nparticipants, without the need for per-participant training.

Displaying curiosity is simultaneously a\nfactor to improve a companion's believability and to unobtrusively affect the\nuser's activities over time. Curiosity represents a drive to know new things.\nIt is a major driving force for engaging learners in active learning. Existing\nresearch work pays little attention in curiosity. In this paper, we enrich the\nsocial skills of a virtual companion by infusing curiosity into its mental\nmodel. A curious companion residing in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to\nstimulate user's curiosity is proposed. The curious companion model is\ndeveloped based on multidisciplinary considerations. The effectiveness of the\ncurious companion is demonstrated by a preliminary field study."

Usability evaluation is\nconsidered as one approach to assess the efficiency of e-Learning systems. It\nis used to evaluate how well technology and tools are working for users. There\nare some factors contributing as major reason why LMS is not used effectively\nand regularly. Learning Management Systems, as major part of e-Learning\nsystems, can benefit from usability research to evaluate the LMS ease of use\nand satisfaction among its handlers. Many academic institutions worldwide\nprefer using their own customized Learning Management Systems; this is the case\nwith Moodle, an open source Learning Management Systems platform designed and\noperated by most of the universities in Sri Lanka. This paper gives an overview\nof Learning Management Systems used in Sri Lankan universities, and evaluates\nits usability using some pre-defined usability standards. In addition it\nmeasures the effectiveness of Learning Management System by testing the\nLearning Management Systems. The findings and result of this study as well as\nthe testing are discussed and presented."

    "summary": "Current layouts for alphabetic input on mobile phone keypads are very\ninefficient. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to find a suitable keypad\nlayout for each user, based on their personal text history. It incorporates\ncodes for frequent multigrams, which may be directly input. This greatly\nreduces the average number of strokes required for typing. We optimize for\ntwo-handed use, the left thumb covering the leftmost rows and vice versa. The\nGA mini- mizes the number of strokes, consecutive use of the same key, and\nconsecutive use of the same hand. Using these criteria, the algorithm\nre-arranges the 26 alphabetic characters, plus 14 additional multigrams, on the\n10-key pad. We demonstrate that this arrangement can generate a more effective\nlayout, especially for SMS-style messages. Substantial savings are verified by\nboth computational analysis and human evaluation."

Despite the attractiveness and simplicity\nof producing word clouds, they do not provide a thorough visualization for the\ndistribution of the underlying data. Therefore, it is important to redesign\nword clouds for improving their design choices and to be able to do further\nstatistical analysis on data. In this paper we have proposed a fully automatic\nredesigning algorithm for word cloud visualization. Our proposed method is able\nto decode an input word cloud visualization and provides the raw data in the\nform of a list of (word, value) pairs. To the best of our knowledge our work is\nthe first attempt to extract raw data from word cloud visualization. We have\ntested our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

CAPTCHAs play an\nimportant role in identifying human users in internet to prevent unauthorized\nbot attacks. Even though there are numerous CAPTCHA alternatives available\ntoday, there are certain drawbacks attached with each alternative, making them\nharder to find a general solution for the necessity of a CAPTCHA mechanism.\nWith the advancing technology and expertise in areas such as AI, cryptography\nand image processing, it has come to a stage where the chase between making and\nbreaking CAPTCHAs are even now. This has led the humans with a hard time\ndeciphering the CAPTCHA mechanisms. In this paper, we adapt a novel CAPTCHA\nmechanism named as LineCAPTCHA to mobile devices. LineCAPTCHA is a new reverse\nTuring test based on drawing on top of Bezier curves within noisy backgrounds.\nThe major objective of this paper is to report the implementation and\nevaluation of LineCAPTCHA on a mobile platform. At the same time we impose\ncertain security standards and security aspects for establishing LineCAPTCHAs\nwhich are obtained through extensive measures. Independency from factors such\nas the fluency in English language, age and easily understandable nature of it\ninclines the usability of LineCAPTCHA. We believe that such independency will\nfavour the main target of LineCAPTCHA, user friendliness and usability."

Compared to related\nwork, WiGest is unique in using standard WiFi equipment, with no\nmodi-fications, and no training for gesture recognition. The system identifies\ndifferent signal change primitives, from which we construct mutually\nindependent gesture families. These families can be mapped to distinguishable\napplication actions. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy\nsignals, gesture type and attributes detection, reducing false positives due to\ninterfering humans, and adapting to changing signal polarity. We implement a\nproof-of-concept prototype using off-the-shelf laptops and extensively evaluate\nthe system in both an office environment and a typical apartment with standard\nWiFi access points. Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives\nwith an accuracy of 87.5% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall\nnon-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy in-creases to 96% using three\noverheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media\nplayer application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96%. This accuracy\nis robust to the presence of other interfering humans, highlighting WiGest's\nability to enable future ubiquitous hands-free gesture-based interaction with\nmobile devices."

The assistME Server works as a central control unit in the\nplatform and collects data from the installed sensors in the factory pipeline.\nIn the case of any unexpected behavior or any critical situation in the factory\npipeline, notification and other details are sent to the related group of\nengineers and experts through the assistME mobile app. Further, the co-assistME\ncollaborative environment, equipped with a large shared screen and multiple\nmobile devices, helps the engineers and experts to collaborate with to\nunderstand and analyze the current situation in the factory pipeline in order\nto maintain it accurately."

    "summary": "This article is about one feature which was partly introduced 30 years ago\nwith the development of multi windows operating systems. It is about the\nmovability of screen objects not according to some predetermined algorithm but\nby the direct user action. Many years ago it was introduced on a very limited\nbasis and nothing was improved since then. Smartphones and tablets give direct\naccess to screen elements but on a very limited set of commands (scroll and\nzoom). There is an easy to use algorithm which turns any screen object into\nmovable / resizable. This algorithm uses only mouse to turn screens of normal\nPCs into touchscreens, but this simple change means a revolution in our work\nwith computers."

    "summary": "P300 is an electric signal emitted by brain about 300 milliseconds after a\nrare, but relevant-for-the-user event. One of the applications of this signal\nis sentence spelling that enables subjects who lost the control of their motor\npathways to communicate by selecting characters in a matrix containing all the\nalphabet symbols. Although this technology has made considerable progress in\nthe last years, it still suffers from both low communication rate and high\nerror rate. This article presents a P300 speller, named PolyMorph, that\nintroduces two major novelties in the field: the selection matrix polymorphism,\nthat reduces the size of the selection matrix itself by removing useless\nsymbols, and sentence-based predictions, that exploit all the spelt characters\nof a sentence to determine the probability of a word. In order to measure the\neffectiveness of the presented speller, we describe two sets of tests: the\nfirst one in vivo and the second one in silico. The results of these\nexperiments suggest that the use of PolyMorph in place of the naive\ncharacter-by-character speller both increases the number of spelt characters\nper time unit and reduces the error rate."

    "summary": "Cartograms are maps in which areas of geographic regions (countries, states)\nappear in proportion to some variable of interest (population, income).\nCartograms are popular visualizations for geo-referenced data that have been\naround for over a century. Newspapers, magazines, textbooks, blogs, and\npresentations frequently employ cartograms to show voting results, popularity,\nand in general, geographic patterns. Despite the popularity of cartograms and\nthe large number of cartogram variants, there are very few studies evaluating\nthe effectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. In order to design\ncartograms as a useful visualization tool and to be able to compare the\neffectiveness of cartograms generated by different methods, we need to study\nthe nature of information conveyed and the specific tasks that can be performed\non cartograms. In this paper we consider a set of cartogram visualization\ntasks, based on standard taxonomies from cartography and information\nvisualization. We then propose a cartogram task taxonomy that can be used to\norganize not only the tasks considered here but also other tasks that might be\nadded later."

    "summary": "Over the last years, most websites on which users can register (e.g., email\nproviders and social networks) adopted CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public\nTuring test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) as a countermeasure against\nautomated attacks. The battle of wits between designers and attackers of\nCAPTCHAs led to current ones being annoying and hard to solve for users, while\nstill being vulnerable to automated attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose CAPTCHaStar, a new image-based CAPTCHA that relies\non user interaction. This novel CAPTCHA leverages the innate human ability to\nrecognize shapes in a confused environment. We assess the effectiveness of our\nproposal for the two key aspects for CAPTCHAs, i.e., usability, and resiliency\nto automated attacks. In particular, we evaluated the usability, carrying out a\nthorough user study, and we tested the resiliency of our proposal against\nseveral types of automated attacks: traditional ones; designed ad-hoc for our\nproposal; and based on machine learning. Compared to the state of the art, our\nproposal is more user friendly (e.g., only some 35% of the users prefer current\nsolutions, such as text-based CAPTCHAs) and more resilient to automated\nattacks."

More recently, there\nhas been a concerted effort to understand aspects beyond time and errors. In\nthis paper we study enjoyment, which, while arguably not the primary goal of\nvisualization, has been shown to impact performance and memorability. Different\nmodels of enjoyment have been proposed in psychology, education and gaming; yet\nthere is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in\nvisualization. In this paper we relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to\nMunzner's nested model of visualization evaluation and previous work in the\narea. We suggest that, even though previous papers tackled individual elements\nof flow, in order to understand what specifically makes a visualization\nenjoyable, it might be necessary to measure all specific elements."

To address this usability-security tension, we argue that systems\nshould assign random passwords but also help with memorization and recall. We\ninvestigate the feasibility of this approach with CuedR, a novel\ncued-recognition authentication scheme that provides users with multiple cues\n(visual, verbal, and spatial) and lets them choose the cues that best fit their\nlearning process for later recognition of system-assigned keywords. In our lab\nstudy, all 37 of our participants could log in within three attempts one week\nafter registration (mean login time: 38.0 seconds). A pilot study on using\nmultiple CuedR passwords also showed 100% recall within three attempts. Based\non our results, we suggest appropriate applications for CuedR, such as\nfinancial and e-commerce accounts."

    "summary": "The number of applications on online mobile application stores is increasing\nat a rapid rate. Smart-phones are used by a wide range of people varying in\nage, and also in the ability to use a smart phone. With the increasing\ndependency on smart-phones, the paper aims to determine whether the popular\napplications on Google Play, the official store for Android applications, can\nbe used by people with vision impairment. The accessibility of the applications\nwas tested using an external keyboard, and TalkBack, an accessibility tool\ndeveloped by Google. It was found that several popular applications on the\nstore were not designed keeping accessibility in mind. It was observed that\nthere exists a weak positive relationship between the popularity of the\napplication and its accessibility. A framework is proposed that can be used by\ndevelopers to improve the accessibility of an application. The paper also\ndiscusses the programming aspects to be considered while developing an Android\napplication, so that the application can be used by sighted as well as visually\nimpaired users."

For this study, we implement a CHI-based system on mobile phone.\nThe CHI-based system offers the pathway suggestion and the solution of the\nlocation-based objectives based on its trajectory management. Without any\npriori knowledge on the area of interest and any aid from other equipments, a\nlaborer can achieve his location-based objectives by walking through the area\nof interest and simultaneously online interacting with the CHI-based system\ninstalled in his phone. In evaluation, we conduct the experiments and show the\nadvantage CHI in reducing the time cost and the expense cost for the laborer."

Understanding touch patterns during\ntext entry could be useful in designing robust error-correction algorithms for\nsoft keyboards. In this paper, we present an analysis of text input behaviors\non a soft QWERTY keyboard in three different text entry postures: index finger\nonly, one thumb, and two thumb. Our work expands on the work of [1] by\nconsidering the entire surface area of digit contact with the smartphone\nkeyboard, rather than interpreting each touch as a single point. To do this, we\ncaptured touch areas for every key in a lab study with 8 participants and\ncalculated offsets, error rates, and size measurements. We then repeated the\noriginal experiment described in [1] and showed that significant differences\nexist when basing offset calculations on touch area compared to touch points\nfor two postures."

Despite the popularity of cartograms and the\nlarge number of cartogram types, there are few studies evaluating the\neffectiveness of cartograms in conveying information. Based on a recent task\ntaxonomy for cartograms, we evaluate four major different types of cartograms:\ncontiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling cartograms. Specifically,\nwe evaluate the effectiveness of these cartograms by quantitative performance\nanalysis, as well as by subjective preferences. We analyze the results of our\nstudy in the context of some prevailing assumptions in the literature of\ncartography and cognitive science. Finally, we make recommendations for the use\nof different types of cartograms for different tasks and settings."

When developing a system for those modern\ndevices that supports both graph exploration and graph editing, it is necessary\nto 1) identify what basic tasks need to be supported, 2) what interactions can\nbe used, and 3) how to map these tasks and interactions. This technical report\nprovides a list of basic interaction tasks for graph exploration and editing as\na result of an extensive system review. Moreover, different interaction\nmodalities of interactive surfaces are reviewed according to their interaction\nvocabulary and further degrees of freedom that can be used to make interactions\ndistinguishable are discussed. Beyond the scope of graph exploration and\nediting, we provide an approach for finding and evaluating a mapping from tasks\nto interactions, that is generally applicable. Thus, this work acts as a\nguideline for developing a system for graph exploration and editing that is\nspecifically designed for interactive surfaces."

    "summary": "The aim of this study is to understand what are the collective actions of\narchitecture practitioners when grouping floor plan designs. The understanding\nof how professionals and students solve this complex problem may help to\ndevelop specific programmes for the teaching of architecture. In addition, the\nfindings of this study can help in the development of query mechanisms for\ndatabase retrieval of floor plans and the implementation of clustering\nmechanisms to aggregate floor plans resulting from generative design methods.\nThe study aims to capture how practitioners define similarity between floor\nplans from a pool of available designs. A hybrid evolutionary strategy is used,\nwhich takes into account the building's functional program to generate\nalternative floor plan designs. The first step of this methodology consisted in\nan online survey to gather information on how the respondents would perform a\nclustering task. Online surveys have been used in several applications and are\na method of data collection that conveys several advantages. When properly\ndeveloped and implemented, a survey portrays the characteristics of large\ngroups of respondents on a specific topic and allows assessing its\nrepresentation. Several types of surveys are available; e.g. questionnaire and\ninterview formats, phone survey, and online surveys, which can be coupled with\ninference engines that act and direct the survey according to respondents'\nanswers. In the present study, the survey was posed as an online exercise in\nwhich respondents had to perform a pre-defined task, which makes it similar to\nrunning an experiment in an online environment. The experiment aimed to\nunderstand the perception and criteria of the target population to perform the\nclustering task by comparing the results with the respondents' answers to a\nquestionnaire presented at the end of the exercise."

    "summary": "The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in\nmantaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of\ngeneration and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy\nresources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved\nthrough demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential\noverload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of\nthis mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is\nnevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid\nand its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an\ninteractive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in\norder to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze\ndata being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain\ninsights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems.\nThe outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential\nbuildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of\nhardware measurement units and a management software. The Mj\\\"olnir framework,\nwhich we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback\nconcepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying\ndisaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily\nproduction and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an\nadvisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy\nfeedback."

We adopt an extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA) topic modeling called LDA-dual to infer a set of color-word topics over a\ncorpus of 2,654 magazine covers spanning 71 distinct titles and 12 genres.\nWhile LDA models text documents as distributions over word topics, we model\nmagazine covers as distributions over color-word topics. The results of our\ncrowdsourced experiments confirm that the model is able to successfully\ndiscover the associations between colors and linguistic concepts. Finally, we\ndemonstrate several simple prototypes that apply the learned model to color\npalette recommendation, design example retrieval, image retrieval, image color\nselection, and image recoloring."

    "summary": "A human computation system can be viewed as a distributed system in which the\nprocessors are humans, called workers. Such systems harness the cognitive power\nof a group of workers connected to the Internet to execute relatively simple\ntasks, whose solutions, once grouped, solve a problem that systems equipped\nwith only machines could not solve satisfactorily. Examples of such systems are\nAmazon Mechanical Turk and the Zooniverse platform. A human computation\napplication comprises a group of tasks, each of them can be performed by one\nworker. Tasks might have dependencies among each other. In this study, we\npropose a theoretical framework to analyze such type of application from a\ndistributed systems point of view. Our framework is established on three\ndimensions that represent different perspectives in which human computation\napplications can be approached: quality-of-service requirements, design and\nmanagement strategies, and human aspects. By using this framework, we review\nhuman computation in the perspective of programmers seeking to improve the\ndesign of human computation applications and managers seeking to increase the\neffectiveness of human computation infrastructures in running such\napplications. In doing so, besides integrating and organizing what has been\ndone in this direction, we also put into perspective the fact that the human\naspects of the workers in such systems introduce new challenges in terms of,\nfor example, task assignment, dependency management, and fault prevention and\ntolerance. We discuss how they are related to distributed systems and other\nareas of knowledge."

    "summary": "In the last years several solutions were proposed to support people with\nvisual impairments or blindness during road crossing. These solutions focus on\ncomputer vision techniques for recognizing pedestrian crosswalks and computing\ntheir relative position from the user. Instead, this contribution addresses a\ndifferent problem; the design of an auditory interface that can effectively\nguide the user during road crossing. Two original auditory guiding modes based\non data sonification are presented and compared with a guiding mode based on\nspeech messages.\n  Experimental evaluation shows that there is no guiding mode that is best\nsuited for all test subjects. The average time to align and cross is not\nsignificantly different among the three guiding modes, and test subjects\ndistribute their preferences for the best guiding mode almost uniformly among\nthe three solutions. From the experiments it also emerges that higher effort is\nnecessary for decoding the sonified instructions if compared to the speech\ninstructions, and that test subjects require frequent `hints' (in the form of\nspeech messages). Despite this, more than 2/3 of test subjects prefer one of\nthe two guiding modes based on sonification. There are two main reasons for\nthis: firstly, with speech messages it is harder to hear the sound of the\nenvironment, and secondly sonified messages convey information about the\n\"quantity\" of the expected movement."

Our personas uniquely describe users' OHC participation intertwined with\nillness contexts compared to existing social types in general online\ncommunities.

In this paper, leveraging the fine-grained Channel State\nInformation (CSI) and multi-antenna setting in commodity WiFi devices, we\ndesign and implement a real-time, non-intrusive, and low-cost indoor fall\ndetector, called Anti-Fall. For the first time, the CSI phase difference over\ntwo antennas is identified as the salient feature to reliably segment the fall\nand fall-like activities, both phase and amplitude information of CSI is then\nexploited to accurately separate the fall from other fall-like activities.\nExperimental results in two indoor scenarios demonstrate that Anti-Fall\nconsistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall, with 10% higher\ndetection rate and 10% less false alarm rate on average."

In this paper we\npresent a novel system that allows multiple mobile devices to work\ncollaboratively in a synchronized fashion to capture a panorama of a highly\ndynamic scene, creating an entirely new photography experience that encourages\nsocial interactions and teamwork. Our system contains two components: a client\napp that runs on all participating devices, and a server program that monitors\nand communicates with each device. In a capturing session, the server collects\nin realtime the viewfinder images of all devices and stitches them on-the-fly\nto create a panorama preview, which is then streamed to all devices as visual\nguidance. The system also allows one camera to be the host and to send direct\nvisual instructions to others to guide camera adjustment. When ready, all\ndevices take pictures at the same time for panorama stitching. Our preliminary\nstudy suggests that the proposed system can help users capture high quality\npanoramas with an enjoyable teamwork experience.\n  A demo video of the system in action is provided at\nhttp://youtu.be/PwQ6k_ZEQSs."

    "summary": "For many applications, such as targeted advertising and content\nrecommendation, knowing users' traits and interests is a prerequisite. User\nprofiling is a helpful approach for this purpose. However, current methods,\ni.e. self-reporting, web-activity monitoring and social media mining are either\nintrusive or require data over long periods of time. Recently, there is growing\nevidence in cognitive science that a variety of users' profile is significantly\ncorrelated with eye-tracking data. We propose a novel just-in-time implicit\nprofiling method, Eye-2-I, which learns the user's interests, demographic and\npersonality traits from the eye-tracking data while the user is watching\nvideos. Although seemingly conspicuous by closely monitoring the user's eye\nbehaviors, our method is unobtrusive and privacy-preserving owing to its unique\ncharacteristics, including (1) fast speed - the profile is available by the\nfirst video shot, typically few seconds, and (2) self-contained - not relying\non historical data or functional modules. [Bug found. As a proof-of-concept,\nour method is evaluated in a user study with 51 subjects. It achieved a mean\naccuracy of 0.89 on 37 attributes of user profile with 9 minutes of\neye-tracking data.]"

WearWrite allows expert authors who do not\nhave access to large devices to contribute bits of expertise and big picture\ndirection from their watch, while freeing them of the obligation of integrating\ntheir contributions into the overall document. Crowd workers on desktop\ncomputers actually write the document. We used this approach to write several\nsimple papers, and found it was effective at producing reasonable drafts.\nHowever, the workers often needed more structure and the authors more context.\nWearWrite addresses these issues by focusing workers on specific tasks and\nproviding select context to authors on the watch. We demonstrate the system's\nfeasibility by writing this paper using it."

We\ncreated these training exercises on the basis of the linguistic knowledge\nextracted from the errors found in texts written by children with dyslexia. To\ntest the effectiveness of this method in Spanish, we integrated the exercises\nin a game for iPad, DysEggxia (Piruletras in Spanish), and carried out a\nwithin-subject experiment. During eight weeks, 48 children played either\nDysEggxia or Word Search, which is another word game. We conducted tests and\nquestionnaires at the beginning of the study, after four weeks when the games\nwere switched, and at the end of the study. The children who played DysEggxia\nfor four weeks in a row had significantly less writing errors in the tests that\nafter playing Word Search for the same time.

In our research, we attempt to\nrecognize the brain waves of left and right hand movement imagery with portable\nelectroencephalographs. Considering the inconvenience of wearing traditional\nmultiple-electrode electroencephalographs, we choose Muse to collect data which\nis a portable headband launched lately with a number of useful functions and\nchannels and it is much easier for the public to use. Additionally, previous\nresearches generally focused on discrimination of EEG of left and right hand\nmovement imagery by using data from C3 and C4 electrodes which locate on the\ntop of the head. However, we choose the gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 and\nobtain data when subjects imagine their left or right hand to move with their\neyeballs rotated in the corresponding direction. With the help of the Common\nSpace Pattern algorithm to extract features of brain waves between left and\nright hand movement imagery, we make use of the Support Vector Machine to\nclassify different brain waves. Traditionally, the accuracy rate of\nclassification was approximately 90% using the EEG data from C3 and C4\nelectrode poles; however, the accuracy rate reaches 95.1% by using the gamma\nwave data from F7 and F8 in our experiment. Finally, we design a plane program\nin Python where a plane can be controlled to go left or right when users\nimagine their left or right hand to move. 8 subjects are tested and all of them\ncan control the plane flexibly which reveals that our model can be applied to\ncontrol hardware which is useful for disabled individuals and normal people."

With the advent of smartphones it is now possible to monitor\ndiverse aspects of human behaviour, including objectively measured behaviour\nrelated to psychological state and consequently stress. We have used data from\nthe smartphone's built-in accelerometer to detect behaviour that correlates\nwith subjects stress levels. Accelerometer sensor was chosen because it raises\nfewer privacy concerns (in comparison to location, video or audio recording,\nfor example) and because its low power consumption makes it suitable to be\nembedded in smaller wearable devices, such as fitness trackers. 30 subjects\nfrom two different organizations were provided with smartphones. The study\nlasted for 8 weeks and was conducted in real working environments, with no\nconstraints whatsoever placed upon smartphone usage. The subjects reported\ntheir perceived stress levels three times during their working hours. Using\ncombination of statistical models to classify self reported stress levels, we\nachieved a maximum overall accuracy of 71% for user-specific models and an\naccuracy of 60% for the use of similar-users models, relying solely on data\nfrom a single accelerometer."

To address this issue, in this study, we present a comprehensive\ncomparison in a speech-based emotion classification task between 138 Amazon\nMechanical Turk workers (Turkers) and a state-of-the-art automatic computer\nsystem. The comparison includes classifying speech utterances into six emotions\n(happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust and fear), into three arousal classes\n(active, passive, and neutral), and into three valence classes (positive,\nnegative, and neutral). The results show that the computer system outperforms\nthe naive Turkers in almost all cases. Furthermore, the computer system can\nincrease the classification accuracy by rejecting to classify utterances for\nwhich it is not confident, while the Turkers do not show a significantly higher\nclassification accuracy on their confident utterances versus unconfident ones."

    "summary": "EEG-based workload estimation technology provides a real time means of\nassessing mental workload. Such technology can effectively enhance the\nperformance of the human-machine interaction and the learning process. When\ndesigning workload estimation algorithms, a crucial signal processing component\nis the feature extraction step. Despite several studies on this field, the\nspatial properties of the EEG signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG\ninherently has a poor spacial resolution, features extracted individually from\neach EEG channel may not be sufficiently efficient. This problem becomes more\npronounced when we use low-cost but convenient EEG sensors with limited\nstability which is the case in practical scenarios. To address this issue, in\nthis paper, we introduce a filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm\ncombined with a feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features\ndiscriminating different mental workload levels. To evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis between two representative types\nof working memory tasks using data recorded from an Emotiv EPOC headset which\nis a mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The experimental results showed that\nthe proposed spatial filtering algorithm outperformed the state-of-the\nalgorithms in terms of the classification accuracy."

These features\ncharacterize the degree of human physical mobility. State-of-the-art machine\nlearning algorithms (i.e. Bag of Words and Support Vector Machines) are used to\nclassify the severity of gaits in 12 subjects with ages ranging between 65 and\n90 enrolled in a pilot study.

    "summary": "Crime solving is a domain where solution discovery is often serendipitous.\nUnstructured mechanisms, like Reddit, for crime solving through crowds have\nfailed so far. Mechanisms, collaborations, workflows, and micro-tasks necessary\nfor successful crime solving might also vary across different crimes.\nCognitively, while experts might have deeper domain knowledge, they might also\nfall prey to biased analysis. Non-experts, while lacking formal training, might\ninstead offer non-conventional perspectives requiring direction. The analytical\nprocess is itself an iterative process of foraging and sensemaking. Users would\nexplore to broaden solution space and narrow down to a solution iteratively\nuntil identifying the global maxima instead of local maxima. In this proposal,\nmy research aims to design systems for enabling complex sensemaking tasks that\nrequire collaboration between remotely located non-expert crowds with expert\ncrowds to compensate for their cognitive challenges and lack of training. This\nwould require better understanding of the structure, workflow, and micro-tasks\nnecessary for successful collaborations. This proposal builds upon previous\nwork on collaborative sensemaking between remote partners in lab experiments\nand endeavors to scale it across multiple team members, with varying expertise\nlevels."

We also give a practical example where two\nusers relax together, with insights on how Tobe helped them to synchronize\ntheir signals and share a moment."

In this paper, we analyze\nindustry users perception of usability factors, including understandability,\nlearnability, operability and attractiveness, on OSS usability. The research\nmodel of this empirical study establishes the relationship between the key\nusability factors and OSS usability from industrial perspective.

    "summary": "Visually impaired people face important challenges related to orientation and\nmobility. Indeed, 56% of visually impaired people in France declared having\nproblems concerning autonomous mobility. These problems often mean that\nvisually impaired people travel less, which influences their personal and\nprofessional life and can lead to exclusion from society. Therefore this issue\npresents a social challenge as well as an important research area. Accessible\ngeographic maps are helpful for acquiring knowledge about a city's or\nneighborhood's configuration, as well as selecting a route to reach a\ndestination. Traditionally, raised-line paper maps with braille text have been\nused. These maps have proved to be efficient for the acquisition of spatial\nknowledge by visually impaired people. Yet, these maps possess significant\nlimitations. For instance, due to the specificities of the tactile sense only a\nlimited amount of information can be displayed on a single map, which\ndramatically increases the number of maps that are needed. For the same reason,\nit is difficult to represent specific information such as distances. Finally,\nbraille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of\nthe visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people\nare braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States,\nfewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of\nblind children actually learn braille. Recent technological advances have\nenabled the design of interactive maps with the aim to overcome these\nlimitations. Indeed, interactive maps have the potential to provide a broad\nspectrum of the population with spatial knowledge, irrespective of age,\nimpairment, skill level, or other factors. To this regard, they might be an\nefficient means for providing visually impaired people with access to\ngeospatial information. In this paper we give an overview of our research on\nmaking geographic maps accessible to visually impaired people."

However\nrecent evidence suggests that sitting time affects health negatively\nindependent of whether adults meet prescribed physical activity guidelines.\nSince many of us spend long hours daily sitting in front of a host of\nelectronic screens, this is cause for concern. In this paper, we describe a set\nof three prototype digital games created for encouraging light-intensity\nphysical activity during short breaks at work. The design of these kinds of\ngames is a complex process that must consider motivation strategies,\ninteraction methodology, usability and ludic aspects. We present design\nguidelines for technologies that encourage physical activity in the workplace\nthat we derived from a user evaluation using the prototypes. Although the\ndesign guidelines can be seen as general principles, we conclude that they have\nto be considered differently for different workplace cultures and workspaces.\nOur study was conducted with users who have some experience playing casual\ngames on their mobile devices and were able and willing to increase their\nphysical activity."

    "summary": "MetaSpace II (MS2) is a social Virtual Reality (VR) system where multiple\nusers can not only see and hear but also interact with each other, grasp and\nmanipulate objects, walk around in space, and get tactile feedback. MS2 allows\nwalking in physical space by tracking each user's skeleton in real-time and\nallows users to feel by employing passive haptics i.e., when users touch or\nmanipulate an object in the virtual world, they simultaneously also touch or\nmanipulate a corresponding object in the physical world. To enable these\nelements in VR, MS2 creates a correspondence in spatial layout and object\nplacement by building the virtual world on top of a 3D scan of the real world.\nThrough the association between the real and virtual world, users are able to\nwalk freely while wearing a head-mounted device, avoid obstacles like walls and\nfurniture, and interact with people and objects. Most current virtual reality\n(VR) environments are designed for a single user experience where interactions\nwith virtual objects are mediated by hand-held input devices or hand gestures.\nAdditionally, users are only shown a representation of their hands in VR\nfloating in front of the camera as seen from a first person perspective. We\nbelieve, representing each user as a full-body avatar that is controlled by\nnatural movements of the person in the real world (see Figure 1d), can greatly\nenhance believability and a user's sense immersion in VR."

We implemented a telepresence interaction\nsystem which is composed of a telepresence robot and tele-interactive objects\nlocated in a local space, the TIUI of a pad located in a remote space, and the\nwireless networks connecting the two spaces.

However,\ngathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading\nremains a critical technical challenge. In this context, Value of Information\n(VOI) is a crucial decision-theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with\nhuman sensors. We present a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework\nthat can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with\ncomputationally efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning.\nSupervised learning is used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nto extract hierarchical features from 'images' of belief spaces obtained via\ndata fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to\nreliably compute VOI for human interaction. The CNN framework is described in\ndetail, and a performance comparison to a feature-based POMDP scheduling policy\nis provided. The practical feasibility of our method is also demonstrated on a\nmobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs."

    "summary": "In micro-blogging platforms, people connect and interact with others.\nHowever, due to cognitive biases, they tend to interact with like-minded people\nand read agreeable information only. Many efforts to make people connect with\nthose who think differently have not worked well. In this paper, we\nhypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have\nbeen direct -- they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having\nopposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or\npresentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral\nchange. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a\nvisualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends\npolitically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and\ndisplays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's\npersonal content. We performed an \"in the wild\" evaluation of this platform,\nand found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased\nalgorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the\nmixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed\npolitically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the\nrecommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects:\nfirst, which individual differences are important when designing platforms\naimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces\nshould be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased\nbehavior."

    "summary": "This paper proposes the concept of \"live-action virtual reality games\" as a\nnew genre of digital games based on an innovative combination of live-action,\nmixed-reality, context-awareness, and interaction paradigms that comprise\ntangible objects, context-aware input devices, and embedded/embodied\ninteractions. Live-action virtual reality games are \"live-action games\" because\na player physically acts out (using his/her real body and senses) his/her\n\"avatar\" (his/her virtual representation) in the game stage, which is the\nmixed-reality environment where the game happens. The game stage is a kind of\n\"augmented virtuality\"; a mixed-reality where the virtual world is augmented\nwith real-world information. In live-action virtual reality games, players wear\nHMD devices and see a virtual world that is constructed using the physical\nworld architecture as the basic geometry and context information. Physical\nobjects that reside in the physical world are also mapped to virtual elements.\nLive-action virtual reality games keeps the virtual and real-worlds\nsuperimposed, requiring players to physically move in the environment and to\nuse different interaction paradigms (such as tangible and embodied interaction)\nto complete game activities. This setup enables the players to touch physical\narchitectural elements (such as walls) and other objects, \"feeling\" the game\nstage. Players have free movement and may interact with physical objects placed\nin the game stage, implicitly and explicitly. Live-action virtual reality games\ndiffer from similar game concepts because they sense and use contextual\ninformation to create unpredictable game experiences, giving rise to emergent\ngameplay."

    "summary": "Pointing devices that reside on the keyboard can reduce the overall time\nneeded to perform mixed pointing and typing tasks, since the hand of the user\ndoes not have to reach for the pointing device. However, previous\nimplementations of this kind of device have a higher movement time compared to\nthe mouse and trackpad due to large error rate, low speed and spatial\nresolution. In this paper we introduce Keyboard Surface Interaction (KSI), an\ninteraction approach that turns the surface of a keyboard into an interaction\nsurface and allows users to rest their hands on the keyboard at all times to\nminimize fatigue. We developed a proof-of-concept implementation, Fingers,\nwhich we optimized over a series of studies. Finally, we evaluated Fingers\nagainst the mouse and trackpad in a user study with 25 participants on a Fitts\nlaw test style, mixed typing and pointing task. Results showed that for users\nwith more exposure to KSI, our KSI device had better performance (reduced\nmovement and homing time) and reduced discomfort compared to the trackpad. When\ncompared to the mouse, KSI had reduced homing time and reduced discomfort, but\nincreased movement time. This interaction approach is not only a new way to\ncapitalize on the space on top of the keyboard, but also a call to innovate and\nthink beyond the touchscreen, touchpad, and mouse as our main pointing devices.\nThe results of our studies serve as a specification for future KSI devices."

    "summary": "Alphanumeric authentication routinely fails to regulate access to resources\nwith the required stringency, primarily due to usability issues. Initial\ndeployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws\nonly emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a\nreplacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into\nknowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry.\nAlternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that\nalternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the\nresults from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their\nviability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically\nwhere the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is\nthat the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially\ntargeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of\ncontexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another.\nConsequently, the contribution of this paper is an \"in the wild\" evaluation of\nan alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its\nlab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to\nregulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed.\nThe performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by\nreflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication\nmechanisms."

Recently,\nreal-time GPS coordinates of all operating public buses has been made publicly\navailable - roughly 1 million GPS entries each captured each day. In an initial\nstudy, we observed that a substantial number of buses follow trajectories that\ndo not follow the expected behavior. In this paper, we present RioBusData, a\ntool that helps users identify and explore, through different visualizations,\nthe behavior of outlier trajectories. We describe how the system automatically\ndetects these outliers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and we also\ndiscuss a series of case studies which show how RioBusData helps users better\nunderstand not only the flow and service of outlier buses but also the bus\nsystem as a whole."

    "summary": "Forgetting is in common in daily life, and 50-80% everyday's forgetting is\ndue to prospective memory failures, which have significant impacts on our life.\nMore seriously, some of these memory lapses can bring fatal consequences such\nas forgetting a sleeping infant in the back seat of a car. People tend to use\nvarious techniques to improve their prospective memory performance. Setting up\na reminder is one of the most important techniques. The existing studies\nprovide evidences in support of using reminders to cope with prospective memory\nfailures. However, people are not satisfied with existing reminders because of\ntheir limitations in different aspects including reliability, optimization, and\nadaption.\n  Through analysing the functions and features of existing reminder systems,\nthis book draft summarizes their advantages and limitations. We are motivated\nto improve the performance of reminder systems. For the improvements, the\nrelevant theories and mechanisms of prospective memory from psychology must be\ncomplied with, incorporated, and applied in this new study.\n  Based on the literature review, a new reminder model is proposed, which\nincludes a novel reminder planer, a prospective memory based agent, and a\npersonalized user model. The reminder planer is responsible for determining the\noptimal reminder plan (including the optimal number of reminders, the optimal\nreminding schedule and the optimal reminding way). The prospective memory agent\nis responsible for executing the reminding processes. The personalized user\nmodel is proposed to learn from users' behaviors and preferences based on\nhuman-system interactions and is responsible for adapting the reminder plan to\nmeet users' preferences as much as possible."

This selection task can\nbe performed by fixing eye gaze on a key for a prolonged time. Spending\nsufficient amount of time on each key effectively decreases the overall eye\ntyping rate. To address the problem, researchers proposed mechanisms, which\ndiminish the dwell time. We conducted a within-subject usability evaluation of\nfour dwell-free eye typing techniques. The results of first-time usability\nstudy, longitudinal study and subjective evaluation conducted with 15\nparticipants confirm the superiority of controlled eye movement based advanced\neye typing method (Adv-EyeK) than the other three techniques."

    "summary": "The elderly often struggle when interacting with technologies. This is\nbecause the software and hardware components of the technologies are not\nfamiliar to the elderly's mental model. This is a lack of empirical studies\nabout how the concept of familiarity can be infused into the design of\ninteractive technology systems to bridge the digital divide preventing today's\nelderly people from actively engaging with such technologies. In this paper, a\nmulti pronged approach is utilized. We investigate the Effects of Familiarity\nin Design on the Adoption of Wellness Games by the Elderly, familiarity in\nproductive ageing, familiarity in efficient collaborative crowdsourcing,\nproductive ageing through familiarity based Intelligent Personalized\nCrowdsourcing and familiarity based Agent Augmented Inter-generational\nCrowdsourcing. The results show that familiarity in design improves the\nperceived satisfaction and adoption likelihood significantly among the elderly\nusers. These results can potentially benefit intelligent interface agent design\nwhen such agents need to interact with elderly users. A Crowdsourcing\nalgorithm, CrowdAsm is developed. By using CrowdAsm we are able to dynamically\nassemble teams of workers considering the budgets, the availability of workers\nwith the required skills and their track records to complete crowdsourcing\ntasks requiring collaboration among workers with heterogeneous skills.\nTheoretical analysis has shown that CrowdAsm can achieve close to optimal\nprofit for a collaborative crowdsourcing system if workers follow the\nrecommendations."

However, in most cases visually mining and understanding a large\nmultivariate data set requires more finesse, and greater level of interactivity\nto really grasp the full spectrum of the information being presented. We\npresent a paradigm for glyph design and use in the creation of single plots\npresenting multiple variables of information. We center our design on two key\nconcepts. The first concept is that visually it is easier to discriminate\nbetween completely distinct shapes rather than subtly different ones, specially\nwhen partially occluded. The second one is that users ingest information in\nlayers, i.e. in an order of visual relevance. Using this paradigm, we present\ncomplex data as binned into desired and relevant discrete categories. We show\nresults in the areas of high energy physics and security, displaying over 6\ndistinct data variables in each single plot, yielding a clear, highly readable,\nand effective visualization."

In our model, we assume\nthat one can integrate awareness in information systems to positively influence\nbeliefs about them.

    "summary": "In mixed reality, real objects can be used to interact with virtual objects.\nHowever, unlike in the real world, real objects do not encounter any opposite\nreaction force when pushing against virtual objects. The lack of reaction force\nduring manipulation prevents users from perceiving the mass of virtual objects.\nAlthough this could be addressed by equipping real objects with force-feedback\ndevices, such a solution remains complex and impractical.In this work, we\npresent a technique to produce an illusion of mass without any active\nforce-feedback mechanism. This is achieved by simulating the effects of this\nreaction force in a purely visual way. A first study demonstrates that our\ntechnique indeed allows users to differentiate light virtual objects from heavy\nvirtual objects. In addition, it shows that the illusion is immediately\neffective, with no prior training. In a second study, we measure the lowest\nmass difference (JND) that can be perceived with this technique. The\neffectiveness and ease of implementation of our solution provides an\nopportunity to enhance mixed reality interaction at no additional cost."

Although the benefits of running are numerous, there\nis a risk of Running Related Injuries (RRI) of the lower extremities.\nElectromyography (EMG) techniques have previously been used to study causes of\nRRIs, but the complexity of this technology limits its use to a laboratory\nsetting. As running is primarily an outdoors activity, this lack of technology\nacts as a barrier to the study of RRIs in natural environments. This study\npresents a minimally invasive wearable muscle sensing device consisting of\njogging leggings with embroidered surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes capable of\nrecording muscle activity data of the quadriceps group. To test the use of the\ndevice, a proof of concept study consisting of $N=2$ runners performing a set\nof $5km$ running trials is presented in which the effect of running surfaces on\nmuscle fatigue, a potential cause of RRIs, is evaluated. Results show that\nmuscle fatigue can be analysed from the sEMG data obtained through the wearable\ndevice, and that running on soft surfaces (such as sand) may increase the\nlikelihood of suffering from RRIs."

We instantiate this idea\nin Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd interns with crowd\nmentors. Atelier guides mentor-intern pairs to break down expert crowdsourcing\ntasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve together.\nWe conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to a\nnon-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task,\nfinding that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best\npractices."

In this paper, we\ndescribe Jimbo, a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) that\nwe believe is beneficial and effective in both aforementioned activities. Jimbo\nintegrates many features that support better collaboration and communication\nbetween designers and developers, to bridge communication gaps and develop\nmutual understanding.

In our recent deployment of Habito, an activity\ntracking mobile app, we found individuals \"readiness\" to behavior change (or\nthe stage of behavior change they were in) to be a strong predictor of\nadoption. Individuals in the contemplation and preparation stages had an\nadoption rate of 56%, whereas individuals in precontemplation, action or\nmaintenance stages had an adoption rate of only 20%.

Our solution is based on the\nconcept of a \"tangible volume\". We turn a tangible object into a handheld\nfish-tank display. The tangible volume represents a volume of space that can be\nfreely manipulated within a virtual scene. This volume can be positioned onto\nvirtual objects to directly grasp them, and to manipulate them in 3D space. We\ninvestigate this concept through two user studies. The first study evaluates\nthe intuitiveness of using a tangible volume for grasping and manipulating\nvirtual objects. The second study evaluates the effects of the limited field of\nview on spatial awareness. Finally, we present a generalization of this concept\nto other forms of interaction through the surface of the volume."

When analysing the system, clear visual\nrepresentations of the performance and accuracy are presented in the results\nusing a confusion matrix, accuracy measurement and a feedback bar signifying\nsignal strength. Experiments with various acquisition datasets were carried out\nand with a critical evaluation of the results given.

    "summary": "Analyzing high-dimensional data and finding hidden patterns is a difficult\nproblem and has attracted numerous research efforts. Automated methods can be\nuseful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via\ninteractive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An\ninherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to\ntruly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this\nlimitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data\nspace into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore\nthese 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface, but using\nadditional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded\nspace comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from\ncombinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and\nnavigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A\nsubspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, and also\nhelps them navigate within and across any higher-dimensional subspaces\nidentified by clustering. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a\nword cloud of attribute labels, sized according to the relevance of the\nassociated data dimensions in the currently selected subspace. Finally, a view\ngallery helps users keep their bearings and return to interesting subspaces and\nviews. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of\napplication areas, such as cluster analysis and refinement, information\ndiscovery, and supervised training of classifiers."

To address this\ntension, we propose and test an interface for collaborative crime analysis that\naims to make analysts more aware of their sensemaking processes. We compare our\nsensemaking translucence interface to a standard interface without special\nsensemaking features in a controlled laboratory study. We found that the\nsensemaking translucence interface significantly improved clue finding and\ncrime solving performance, but that analysts rated the interface lower on\nsubjective measures than the standard interface.

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a real-time adaptive prediction method to calculate\nsmooth and accurate haptic feedback in complex scenarios. Smooth haptic\nfeedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual\nobjects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop\ndown during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational\ncost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic\nsimulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may\ncause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement\nsmooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque\ncalculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed\nmethod, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is\nproposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.\nIn addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth\nforces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical\nsimulation. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of the proposed method\nand compare its performance with other methods and algorithms. The result shows\nthat the proposed method can provide smooth and accurate haptic force feedback\nat a high update rate for complex scenarios."

    "summary": "As interactive devices become pervasive, people are beginning to looking for\nmore advanced interaction with televisions in the living room. Interactive\ntelevision has the potential to offer a very engaging experience. But most\ncommon user tasks are still challenging with such systems, such as menu\nselection or text input. And little work has been done on understanding and\nsup-porting the effective design of freehand interaction with an TV in the\nliving room. In this paper, we perform two studies investi-gating freehand\ngestural interaction with a consumer level sensor, which is suitable for TV\nscenarios. In the first study, we inves-tigate a range of design factors for\ntiled layout menu selection, including wearable feedback, push gesture depth,\ntarget size and position in motor space. The results show that tactile and\naudio feedback have no significant effect on performance and prefer-ence, and\nthese results inform potential designs for high selection performance. In the\nsecond study, we investigate a common TV user task of text input using freehand\ngesture. We design and evaluate two virtual keyboard layouts and three freehand\nselec-tion methods. Results show that ease of use and error tolerance can be\nboth achieved using a text entry method utilizing a dual circle layout and an\nexpanding target selection technique. Finally, we propose design guidelines for\neffective, usable and com-fortable freehand gestural interaction for\ninteractive TV based on the findings."

    "summary": "Interactive visual applications create animations that encode changes in the\ndata. For example, cross-filtering dynamically updates linked visualizations\nbased on the user's continuous brushing actions. The animated effects resulting\nfrom these interactions depends both on how interaction (e.g., brushing speed)\ncontrols properties of the animation such as frame rate, as well as how the\ndata that is being explored dictates the data encoded in the animation. Past\nwork has found that frame rate matters to general perception, however a\ncritical question is which of these animation and data properties affects the\nperceptual accuracy of judgement tasks, and to what extent. Although graphical\nperception has been well studied for static data visualizations, it is ripe for\nexploration in the animated setting. We designed two animated judgment tasks of\na target bar in an animated bar chart and empirically evaluate the effects of 2\nanimations properties - highlighting of the target bar and frame rate - as well\nas 3 data properties that affect the target bar's value throughout the\nanimation. In short, we find that the rate and timing of animation changes is\neasier detected in larger values; that encodings such as color are easier to\ndetect than shapes; and that timing is important - earlier changes were harder\nto perceive as compared to later changes in the animation. Our results are an\ninitial step to understanding perceptual accuracy for animated data\nvisualizations, both for presentations and ultimately as part of interactive\napplications."

Hence, we analyse this effect by investigating the\nsubset of temporal features used as input for statistical classification of IQ.\nWe extend the set of temporal features to contain the system and the user view.\nWe determine the contribution of each feature sub-group showing that temporal\nfeatures contribute most to the classification performance.

To improve upon\ndistant pointing, we propose MPP3D, which is especially suitable for\nhigh-resolution displays. MPP3D uses two dimensions of hand positioning to move\na pointer, and it also uses the third dimension to adjust the precision of the\nmovement. Based on the idea of MPP3D, we propose four techniques which combine\ntwo ways of mapping and two techniques for precision adjustment. We further\nprovide three types of mapping scheme and visual feedback for each technique.\nThe potential of the proposed techniques was investigated through\nexperimentation. The results show that these techniques were competent for\nusual computer operations with a cursor, and the adjustment for pointing\nprecision was beneficial for both pointing efficiency and accuracy."

    "summary": "The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word\nmeanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to\nthe use of the left hand. For example, previous research has established that\nwords with more right hand letters are rated more positively than words with\nmore left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments. In this\npaper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web.\nUsing data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and\nvideos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can\nbe found in decoding text on the web. Furthermore, we investigate whether\nencoding text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well, by analyzing the\nrelationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four\nadditional datasets. Overall, we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect\nboth at the point of text interpretation (decoding) and at the point of text\ncreation (encoding). We also find under which conditions the effect might not\nhold. Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to\nevaluate the meaning of words on the web, including for example semantic or\nsentiment analysis, and show the existence of \"dactilar onomatopoeias\" that\nshape the dynamics of word-meaning associations. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists\nin large scale human-computer interaction on the web."

Objective measurements of motor signs\nare of vital importance for diagnosing, monitoring and developing disease\nmodifying therapies, particularly for the early stages of the disease when\nputative neuroprotective treatments could stop neurodegeneration. Current\nmedical practice has limited tools to routinely monitor PD motor signs with\nenough frequency and without undue burden for patients and the healthcare\nsystem. In this paper, we present data indicating that the routine interaction\nwith computer keyboards can be used to detect motor signs in the early stages\nof PD. We explore a solution that measures the key hold times (the time\nrequired to press and release a key) during the normal use of a computer\nwithout any change in hardware and converts it to a PD motor index. This is\nachieved by the automatic discovery of patterns in the time series of key hold\ntimes using an ensemble regression algorithm. This new approach discriminated\nearly PD groups from controls with an AUC = 0.81 (n = 42/43; mean age =\n59.0/60.1; women = 43%/60%;PD/controls). The performance was comparable or\nbetter than two other quantitative motor performance tests used clinically:\nalternating finger tapping (AUC = 0.75) and single key tapping (AUC = 0.61)."

    "summary": "The blocks editor, such as the editor in Scratch, is widely applied for\nvisual programming languages (VPL) nowadays. Despite it's friendly for\nnon-programmers, it exists three main limitations while displaying block codes:\n(1) the readability, (2) the program structure, and (3) the re-use. To cope\nwith these issues, we introduce a novel formatting tool, block shelves, into\nthe editor for organizing blocks. A user could utilize shelves to constitute a\nuser-defined structure for the VPL projects. Based on the experiment results,\nblock shelves improves the block code navigating and searching significantly.\nBesides, for achieving code re-use, users could use shelf export/import to\nshare/re-use their block codes between projects in the file format of\neXtensible Markup Language (xml.) All functions were demonstrated on MIT App\ninventor 2, while all modifications were made in Google Blockly."

We formulated color, odor and\nshape changing material primitives which act as sensor-actuators that convert\npH signals into human-readable outputs. Food-grade organic molecules\nanthocyanin, vanillin, and chitosan were employed as dopants to synthesize\nmaterials which output a spectrum of colors, degrees of shape deformation, and\nswitch between odorous and non-odorous states. We evaluated the individual\noutput properties of our sensor-actuators to assess the rate, range, and\nreversibility of the changes as a function of pH 2-10. We present a design\nspace with techniques for enhancing the functionality of the material\nprimitives, and offer passive and computational methods for controlling the\nmaterial interfaces. Finally, we explore applications enabled by Organic\nPrimitives under four contexts: environmental, cosmetic, edible, and\ninterspecies."

    "summary": "We study the changes in emotional states induced by reading and participating\nin online discussions, empirically testing a computational model of online\nemotional interaction. Using principles of dynamical systems, we quantify\nchanges in valence and arousal through subjective reports, as recorded in three\nindependent studies including 207 participants (110 female). In the context of\nonline discussions, the dynamics of valence and arousal are composed of two\nforces: an internal relaxation towards baseline values independent of the\nemotional charge of the discussion, and a driving force of emotional states\nthat depends on the content of the discussion. The dynamics of valence show the\nexistence of positive and negative tendencies, while arousal increases when\nreading emotional content regardless of its polarity. The tendency of\nparticipants to take part in the discussion increases with positive arousal.\nWhen participating in an online discussion, the content of participants'\nexpression depends on their valence, and their arousal significantly decreases\nafterwards as a regulation mechanism. We illustrate how these results allow the\ndesign of agent-based models to reproduce and analyze emotions in online\ncommunities. Our work empirically validates the microdynamics of a model of\nonline collective emotions, bridging online data analysis with research in the\nlaboratory."

    "summary": "Preventable medical errors are a severe problem in healthcare, causing over\n400,000 deaths per year in the US in hospitals alone. In acute care, the branch\nof medicine encompassing the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units\n(ICU), error rates may be higher to due low situational awareness among\nclinicians performing resuscitation on patients. To support cognition, novice\nteam leaders may rely on reference guides to direct and anticipate future\nsteps. However, guides often act as a fixation point, diverting the leader's\nattention away from the team. To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative\nstudy that evaluates a collaborative cognitive aid co-designed with clinicians\ncalled Visual TASK. Our study explored the use of Visual TASK in three\nsimulations employing a projected shared display with two different interaction\nmodalities: the Microsoft Kinect and a touchscreen. Our results suggest that\ntools like the Kinect, while useful in other areas of acute care like the OR,\nare unsuitable for use in high-stress situations like resuscitation. We also\nobserved that fixation may not be constrained to reference guides alone, and\nmay extend to other objects in the room. We present our findings, and a\ndiscussion regarding future avenues in which collaborative cognitive aids may\nhelp in improving situational awareness in resuscitation."

    "summary": "The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our\nbehavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination\nwith the introduction of power efficient wireless communication technologies,\nsuch as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered\nto shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build\nentirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to\nfacilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a\nnumber of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the\nuser in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of\npeople traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the\nreceived BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning\nof any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving\nseamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate\nthe use of a seamful approach, i.e. to reveal and exploit these problems and\nturn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the\nviability of this approach, we designed, implemented and evaluated the Ghost\nDetector - an educational location-based museum game for children. By\npresenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design\ndecisions, this paper provides insight into some of the challenges and possible\nsolutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled\nexperiences for public cultural spaces."

In particular, we first\nformalize the optimal task assignment problem when workers' reputation\nestimates are available, as the maximization of a monotone (submodular)\nfunction subject to Matroid constraints. Then, being the optimal problem\nNP-hard, we propose a simple but efficient greedy heuristic task allocation\nalgorithm. We also propose a simple \"maximum a-posteriori\" decision rule and a\ndecision algorithm based on message passing. Finally, we test and compare\ndifferent solutions, showing that system performance can greatly benefit from\ninformation about workers' reputation. Our main findings are that: i) even\nlargely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively\nexploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the\nperformance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as\nworker reputation estimates become inaccurate; iii) when workers' reputation\nestimates are significantly inaccurate, the best performance can be obtained by\ncombining our proposed task assignment algorithm with the message-passing\ndecision algorithm."

    "summary": "Data visualizations typically show retrospective views of an existing dataset\nwith little or no focus on repeatability. However, consumers of these tools\noften use insights gleaned from retrospective visualizations as the basis for\ndecisions about future events. In this way, visualizations often serve as\nvisual predictive models despite the fact that they are typically designed to\npresent historical views of the data. This \"visual predictive model\" approach,\nhowever, can lead to invalid inferences. In this paper, we describe an approach\nto visual model validation called Inline Replication (IR) which, similar to the\ncross-validation technique used widely in machine learning, provides a\nnonparametric and broadly applicable technique for visual model assessment and\nrepeatability. This paper describes the overall IR process and outlines how it\ncan be integrated into both traditional and emerging \"big data\" visualization\npipelines. Examples are provided showing IR integrated within common\nvisualization techniques (such as bar charts and linear regression lines) as\nwell as a more fully-featured visualization system designed for complex\nexploratory analysis tasks."

    "summary": "Gamification initiatives are currently top-of-mind for many organizations\nseeking to engage their employees in creative ways, improve their productivity,\nand drive positive behavioural outcomes in their workforce - ultimately leading\nto positive business outcomes on the whole. Despite its touted benefits, little\nempirical research has been done to date to investigate technological and\nindividual personal factors that determine the success or failure of enterprise\ngamification initiatives. In this article, we provide a summary of our\npreliminary research findings from three case studies of gamification\ninitiatives across different business contexts and present an empirically\nvalidated descriptive framework that details the key success factors for\nenterprise gamification. Our adaptation of the mechanics, dynamics, and\naesthetics (MDA) framework for enterprise gamification aims to explicate the\nconnections between end-user motivations, interactive gameplay elements, and\ntechnology features and functions that constitute effective gamification\ninterventions in the enterprise. Following a discussion of the core elements in\nthe framework and their interrelationships, the implications of our research\nare presented in the form of guidelines for the management and design of\ngamification initiatives and applications. The research findings presented in\nthis article can potentially aid in the development of game mechanics that\ntranslate into positive user experiences and foster higher levels of employee\nengagement. Additionally, our research findings provide insights on key success\nfactors for the effective adoption and institutionalization of enterprise\ngamification initiatives in organizations, and subsequently help them enhance\nthe performance of their employees and drive positive business outcomes."

BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as\nelectroencephalography (EEG) have many applications , however the dissemination\nof the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In\nthis paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade\nOpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an\noriginal montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of\nelectrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a\nsimple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the\nelectrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any\npossible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding\n\"ideal\" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested\n-- the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300\nspeller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a\nsimilar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip -- could be an\neffective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade\nequipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG\nreadings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be\nsuitable for popularizing BCI uses."

We deploy the system\nin one laboratory to study office hours of researchers, a crowded public area\nin city to evaluate the scalability and performance \"in the wild\", and four\nclassrooms in the university to monitor the number of students. We also\nevaluate SenseFlow with varying walking speeds and different models of\nsmartphones to investigate the people flow tracking performance."

    "summary": "Human interactions are characterized by explicit as well as implicit channels\nof communication. While the explicit channel transmits overt messages, the\nimplicit ones transmit hidden messages about the communicator (e.g., his/her\nintentions and attitudes). There is a growing consensus that providing a\ncomputer with the ability to manipulate implicit affective cues should allow\nfor a more meaningful and natural way of studying particular non-verbal signals\nof human-human communications by human-computer interactions. In this pilot\nstudy, we created a non-dynamic human-computer interaction while manipulating\nthree specific non-verbal channels of communication: gaze pattern, facial\nexpression, and gesture. Participants rated the virtual agent on affective\ndimensional scales (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) while their physiological\nsignal (electrodermal activity, EDA) was captured during the interaction.\nAssessment of the behavioral data revealed a significant and complex three-way\ninteraction between gaze, gesture, and facial configuration on the dimension of\npleasure, as well as a main effect of gesture on the dimension of dominance.\nThese results suggest a complex relationship between different non-verbal cues\nand the social context in which they are interpreted. Qualifying considerations\nas well as possible next steps are further discussed in light of these\nexploratory findings."

    "summary": "Maps --- specifically floor plans --- are useful for a variety of tasks from\narranging furniture to designating conceptual or functional spaces (e.g.,\nkitchen, walkway). We present a simple algorithm for quickly laying a floor\nplan (or other conceptual map) onto a SLAM map, creating a one-to-one mapping\nbetween them. Our goal was to enable using a floor plan (or other hand-drawn or\nannotated map) in robotic applications instead of the typical SLAM map created\nby the robot. We look at two use cases, specifying \"no-go\" regions within a\nroom and locating objects within a scanned room. Although a user study showed\nno statistical difference between the two types of maps in terms of performance\non this spatial memory task, we argue that floor plans are closer to the mental\nmaps people would naturally draw to characterize spaces."

    "summary": "Current machine algorithms for analysis of unstructured data typically show\nlow accuracies due to the need for human-like intelligence. Conversely, though\nhumans are much better than machine algorithms on analyzing unstructured data,\nthey are unpredictable, slower and can be erroneous or even malicious as\ncomputing agents. Therefore, a hybrid platform that can intelligently\norchestrate machine and human computing resources would potentially be capable\nof providing significantly better benefits compared to either type of computing\nagent in isolation. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid human-machine\ncomputing platform with integrated service level objectives (SLO) management\nfor complex tasks that can be decomposed into a dependency graph where nodes\nrepresent subtasks. Initial experimental results are highly encouraging. To the\nbest of our knowledge, ours is the first work that attempts to design such a\nhybrid human-machine computing platform with support for addressing the three\nSLO parameters of accuracy, budget and completion time."

    "summary": "Virtual colonoscopy (VC) allows a user to virtually navigate within a\nreconstructed 3D colon model searching for colorectal polyps. Though VC is\nwidely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying\npolyps, one limitation is the reading time, which can take on average 30\nminutes per patient. Large amounts of the colon are often devoid of polyps, and\na way of identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in\nreducing the required reading time for the interrogating radiologist. To this\nend, we have tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of\nnon-expert workers to identify polyp candidates and polyp-free regions. We\npresented twenty short videos flying through a segment of a virtual colon to\neach worker, and the crowd workers are asked to determine whether or not a\npolyp candidate was observed within that video segment. We evaluated our\nframework on Amazon Mechanical Turk and found that the crowd was able to\nachieve a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 86.5% in identifying video\nsegments which contained a clinically proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared\nin multiple consecutive segments, all polyps were in fact identified. Using the\ncrowd results as a first pass, 80% of the video segments could be skipped by\nthe radiologist, equating to a significant time savings and enabling more VC\nexaminations to be performed."

In this paper, we propose a\nprobabilistic method to model human motion behaviors which is determined by\nboth internal and external factors in an indoor environment. While the internal\nfactors are represented by the individual preferences, aims and interests, the\nexternal factors are indicated by the stimulation of the environment. We model\nthe randomness of human macro-level movement, e.g., the probability of visiting\na specific place and staying time, under the Bayesian framework, considering\nthe influence of both internal and external variables. We use two case studies\nin a shopping mall and in a college student dorm building to show the\neffectiveness of our proposed probabilistic human mobility model. Real\nsurveillance camera data are used to validate the proposed model together with\nsurvey data in the case study of student dorm."

    "summary": "Crowd-labeling emerged from the need to label large-scale and complex data, a\ntedious, expensive, and time-consuming task. One of the main challenges in the\ncrowd-labeling task is to control for or determine in advance the proportion of\nlow-quality/malicious labelers. If that proportion grows too high, there is\noften a phase transition leading to a steep, non-linear drop in labeling\naccuracy as noted by Karger et al. [2014]. To address these challenges, we\npropose a new framework called Expert Label Injected Crowd Estimation (ELICE)\nand extend it to different versions and variants that delay phase transition\nleading to a better labeling accuracy. ELICE automatically combines and boosts\nbulk crowd labels supported by labels from experts for limited number of\ninstances from the dataset. The expert-labels help to estimate the individual\nability of crowd labelers and difficulty of each instance, both of which are\nused to aggregate the labels. Empirical evaluation shows the superiority of\nELICE as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We also derive a lower\nbound on the number of expert-labeled instances needed to estimate the crowd\nability and dataset difficulty as well as to get better quality labels."

For\nexample, EEG based BCIs for typing popularly utilize event related potentials\n(ERPs) for inference. Presentation paradigm design in current ERP-based letter\nby letter typing BCIs typically query the user with an arbitrary subset\ncharacters. However, the typing accuracy and also typing speed can potentially\nbe enhanced with more informed subset selection and flash assignment. In this\nmanuscript, we introduce the active recursive Bayesian state estimation\n(active-RBSE) framework for inference and sequence optimization. Prior to\npresentation in each iteration, rather than showing a subset of randomly\nselected characters, the developed framework optimally selects a subset based\non a query function. Selected queries are made adaptively specialized for users\nduring each intent detection. Through a simulation-based study, we assess the\neffect of active-RBSE on the performance of a language-model assisted typing\nBCI in terms of typing speed and accuracy. To provide a baseline for\ncomparison, we also utilize standard presentation paradigms namely, row and\ncolumn matrix presentation paradigm and also random rapid serial visual\npresentation paradigms. The results show that utilization of active-RBSE can\nenhance the online performance of the system, both in terms of typing accuracy\nand speed."

To carry out the project, the High-Level GUI Development\nEnvironment (GUIDE) together with a structured programming approach have been\nused to design the GUI, and to program its related functionalities. The\nfrequency responses are generated by using the generalized equation of each\nfilter class and type; and by using their different circuit topologies (Shunt\nor Series topology). The GUI can also provide reactive element values from\ngiven specification. Moreover, the features for the design of ultra-wideband\n(UWB) band-pass filter, capacitively coupled and combline filter are also\nincorporated into the stand-alone application.

    "summary": "We present the last of a series of three academic essays which deal with the\nquestion of how and why to build a generalized player model. We propose that a\ngeneral player model needs parameters for subjective experience of play,\nincluding: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on\nthis proposition, we pose three linked research questions: RQ1 what is a\nnecessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a\nfoundation improve performance of a computational intelligence- based player\nmodel?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial\nintelligence in games?\n  We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three\nessays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint,\npresents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be\nenhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently\nhuman artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective\nin order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The\nplayer model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial\nintelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a\nper-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a\nuseful tool for studying play in general. We describe the concept and meaning\nof an adaptive game. We propose requirements for functional adaptive AI,\narguing from first principles drawn from the games research literature. We\npropose solutions to these requirements, based on a formal model approach to\nour existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:\n  Cowley, B., & Charles, D. (2016).

This article describes a novel computation paradigm called\nProgressive Computation for Data Analysis or more concisely Progressive\nAnalytics, that brings at the programming language level a low-latency\nguarantee by performing computations in a progressive fashion. Moving this\nprogressive computation at the language level relieves the programmer of\nexploratory data analysis systems from implementing the whole analytics\npipeline in a progressive way from scratch, streamlining the implementation of\nscalable exploratory data analysis systems. This article describes the new\nparadigm through a prototype implementation called ProgressiVis, and explains\nthe requirements it implies through examples."

The University of Cambridge Museums consortium has put\nconsiderable effort into researching the potential uses of emerging\ntechnologies such as BLE to unlock new experiences enriching the way we engage\nwith cultural information. As a part of this research initiative, our ambition\nhas been to examine the challenges and opportunities introduced by the\nintroduction of a BLE-centred system into the museum context. We present an\nassessment of the potential offered by this technology and of the design\napproaches that might yield the best results when developing BLE-centred\nexperiences for museum environments. A pivotal part of our project consisted of\ndesigning, developing and evaluating a prototype mobile location-based\nBLE-centred game. A number of technical problems, such as unstable and\nfluctuating signal strength, were encountered throughout the project lifecycle.\nInstead of attempting to eliminate such problems, we argued in favour of\nembracing them and turning them into a cornerstone of the gameplay. Our study\nsuggested that this alternative seamful design approach yields particularly\ngood results when deploying the technology in public environments.

The tasks required participants to\nwatch a tutorial video on introductory programming and to attend to a simple\nmaze game whilst wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG)device called the Emotiv\nEPOC. The EPOC's proprietary software includes a system which tracks emotional\nstate (specifically: engagement, excitement, meditation, frustration, valence\nand long-term excitement). Using this data, a software application written in\nthe Processing language was developed to track user's engagement levels and\nimplement a neurofeedback based intervention when engagement fell below an\nacceptable level. The aim of the intervention was to prompt learners who\ndisengaged with the task to re-engage. The intervention used during the video\ntutorial was to pause the video if a participant disengaged significantly.\nHowever other interventions such as slowing the video down, playing a noise or\ndarkening/brightening the screen could also be used. For the maze game, the\ncaterpillar moving through the maze slowed in line with disengagement and moved\nmore quickly once the learner re-engaged. The approach worked very well and\nsuccessfully re-engaged participants, although a number of improvements could\nbe made. A number of interesting findings on the comparative engagement levels\nof different groups e.g. by gender and by age etc. were identified and provide\nuseful pointers for future research studies."

    "summary": "In gaming, customizing individual characters, can create personal bonds\nbetween players and their characters. Hence, character customization is a\nstandard component in many games. While mobile Augmented Reality (AR) games\nbecome popular, to date, no 3D character editor for AR games exists. We\ninvestigate the feasibility of 3D character customization for smartphone-based\nAR in an iterative design process.\n  Specifically, we present findings from creating AR prototypes in a handheld\nAR setting. In a first user study, we found that a tangible AR prototype\nresulted in higher hedonistic measures than a camera-based approach. In a\nfollow up study, we compared the tangible AR prototype with a non-AR\ntouchscreen version for selection, scaling, translation and rotation tasks in a\n3D character customization setting. The tangible AR version resulted in\nsignificantly better results for stimulation and novelty measures than the\nnon-AR version. At the same time, it maintained a proficient level in pragmatic\nmeasures such as accuracy and efficiency."

    "summary": "The purpose of this research is to evaluate the human and technical factors\nrequired to create a human-computer interface (HCI) for a structured reporting\nsolution based on eye-gaze and speech signals. Gaze and speech signals from\nradiologists acquired during simulated image interpretation and dictation\nsessions were analyzed to determine a) variation of temporal relationship\nbetween eye gaze and speech in a dictation environment, and b) variation in eye\nmovements for a particular image interpretation task among radiologists.\nKnowledge of these factors provides information regarding the complexity of the\nimage interpretation or dictation task, and provides information that can be\nused to design a HCI for use in diagnostic radiology. Our ultimate goal is to\nuse these data to create an HCI to automate the generation of a particular type\nof structured radiology report. Our data indicate that the a) temporal\nrelationships between eye gaze and speech and b) scan paths substantially vary\namong radiologists, thus implying that an HCI system based on eye gaze and\nspeech for automating the capture of data for structured reporting processes\nshould be customized for each user. The image resolution and layout, image\ncontent, and order of targets during an image interpretation session are not\nrelevant factors to consider when designing an HCI. Our findings can be applied\nto the design of other HCI solutions for radiological applications that involve\nvisual inspection and verbal descriptions of image findings."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a new interface for virtual reality headset: a\ntouchpad in front of the headset. To demonstrate the feasibility of the front\ntouch interface, we built a prototype device, explored VR UI design space\nexpansion, and performed various user studies. We started with preliminary\ntests to see how intuitively and accurately people can interact with the front\ntouchpad. Then, we further experimented various user interfaces such as a\nbinary selection, a typical menu layout, and a keyboard. Two-Finger and\nDrag-n-Tap were also explored to find the appropriate selection technique. As a\nlow-cost, light-weight, and in low power budget technology, a touch sensor can\nmake an ideal interface for mobile headset. Also, front touch area can be large\nenough to allow wide range of interaction types such as multi-finger\ninteractions. With this novel front touch interface, we paved a way to new\nvirtual reality interaction methods."

    "summary": "Task allocation or participant selection is a key issue in Mobile Crowd\nSensing (MCS). While previous participant selection approaches mainly focus on\nselecting a proper subset of users for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented\nparticipant selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale\nMCS platforms. This paper proposes TaskMe, a participant selection framework\nfor multi-task MCS environments. In particular, two typical multi-task\nallocation situations with bi-objective optimization goals are studied: (1) For\nFPMT (few participants, more tasks), each participant is required to complete\nmultiple tasks and the optimization goal is to maximize the total number of\naccomplished tasks while minimizing the total movement distance. (2) For MPFT\n(more participants, few tasks), each participant is selected to perform one\ntask based on pre-registered working areas in view of privacy, and the\noptimization objective is to minimize total incentive payments while minimizing\nthe total traveling distance. Two optimal algorithms based on the Minimum Cost\nMaximum Flow theory are proposed for FPMT, and two algorithms based on the\nmulti-objective optimization theory are proposed for MPFT. Experiments verify\nthat the proposed algorithms outperform baselines based on a large-scale\nreal-word dataset under different experiment settings (the number of tasks,\nvarious task distributions, etc.)."

    "summary": "Albanian Sign Language (AlbSL) is relatively new and until now there doesn't\nexist a system that is able to recognize Albanian signs by using natural user\ninterfaces (NUI). The aim of this paper is to present a real-time gesture\nrecognition system that is able to automatically recognize number signs for\nAlbanian Sign Language, captured from signer's both hands. Kinect device is\nused to obtain data streams. Every pixel generated from Kinect device contains\ndepth data information which is used to construct a depth map. Hands\nsegmentation process is performed by applying a threshold constant to depth\nmap. In order to differentiate signer's hands a K-means clustering algorithm is\napplied to partition pixels into two groups corresponding to each signer's\nhands. Centroid distance function is calculated in each hand after extracting\nhand's contour pixels. Fourier descriptors, derived form centroid distance is\nused as a hand shape representation. For each number gesture there are 15\nFourier descriptors coefficients generated which represent uniquely that\ngesture. Every input data is compared against training data set by calculating\nEuclidean distance, using Fourier coefficients. Sign with the lowest Euclidean\ndistance is considered as a match. The system is able to recognize number signs\ncaptured from one hand or both hands. When both signer's hands are used, some\nof the methodology processes are executed in parallel in order to improve the\noverall performance. The proposed system achieves an accuracy of 91% and is\nable to process 55 frames per second."

    "summary": "Human identification plays an important role in human-computer interaction.\nThere have been numerous methods proposed for human identification (e.g., face\nrecognition, gait recognition, fingerprint identification, etc.). While these\nmethods could be very useful under different conditions, they also suffer from\ncertain shortcomings (e.g., user privacy, sensing coverage range). In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach for human identification, which leverages\nWIFI signals to enable non-intrusive human identification in domestic\nenvironments. It is based on the observation that each person has specific\ninfluence patterns to the surrounding WIFI signal while moving indoors,\nregarding their body shape characteristics and motion patterns. The influence\ncan be captured by the Channel State Information (CSI) time series of WIFI.\nSpecifically, a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete\nWavelet Transform (DWT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques is used for\nCSI waveform-based human identification. We implemented the system in a 6m*5m\nsmart home environment and recruited 9 users for data collection and\nevaluation. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy is\nabout 88.9% to 94.5% when the candidate user set changes from 6 to 2, showing\nthat the proposed human identification method is effective in domestic\nenvironments."

It is currently unknown how these two modern methods\ncompare. We therefore evaluated the text entry performance of both methods in\nEnglish and in Mandarin Chinese on a mobile smartphone. In the speech input\ncase, our speech recognition system gave an initial transcription, and then\nrecognition errors could be corrected using either speech again or the\nsmartphone keyboard. We found that with speech recognition, the English input\nrate was 3.0x faster, and the Mandarin Chinese input rate 2.8x faster, than a\nstate-of-the-art miniature smartphone keyboard. Further, with speech, the\nEnglish error rate was 20.4% lower, and Mandarin error rate 63.4% lower, than\nthe keyboard. Our experiment was carried out using Deep Speech 2, a deep\nlearning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty or Pinyin\n(Mandarin) Apple iOS keyboards. These results show that a significant shift\nfrom typing to speech might be imminent and impactful. Further research to\ndevelop effective speech interfaces is warranted."

    "summary": "Several techniques for visualization of dynamic graphs are based on different\nspatial arrangements of a temporal sequence of node-link diagrams. Many studies\nin the literature have investigated the importance of maintaining the user's\nmental map across this temporal sequence, but usually each layout is considered\nas a static graph drawing and the effect of user interaction is disregarded. We\nconducted a task-based controlled experiment to assess the effectiveness of two\nbasic interaction techniques: the adjustment of the layout stability and the\nhighlighting of adjacent nodes and edges. We found that generally both\ninteraction techniques increase accuracy, sometimes at the cost of longer\ncompletion times, and that the highlighting outclasses the stability adjustment\nfor many tasks except the most complex ones."

    "summary": "Online labor platforms, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk, provide an\neffective framework for eliciting responses to judgment tasks. Previous work\nhas shown that workers respond best to financial incentives, especially to\nextra bonuses. However, most of the tested incentives involve describing the\nbonus conditions in formulas instead of plain English. We believe that\ndifferent incentives given in English (or in qualitative framing) will result\nin differences in workers' performance, especially when task difficulties vary.\nIn this paper, we report the preliminary results of a crowdsourcing experiment\ncomparing workers' performance using only qualitative framings of financial\nincentives. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in workers'\nperformance using a specific well-formulated qualitative framing inspired by\nthe Peer Truth Serum. This positive effect is observed only when the difficulty\nof the task is high, while when the task is easy there is no difference of\nwhich incentives to use."

    "summary": "Information extraction is a critical step in the practice of conducting\nbiomedical systematic literature reviews. Extracted structured data can be\naggregated via methods such as statistical meta-analysis. Typically highly\ntrained domain experts extract data for systematic reviews. The high expense of\nconducting biomedical systematic reviews has motivated researchers to explore\nlower cost methods that achieve similar rigor without compromising quality.\nCrowdsourcing represents one such promising approach. In this work-in-progress\nstudy, we designed a crowdsourcing task for biomedical information extraction.\nWe briefly report the iterative design process and the results of two pilot\ntestings. We found that giving more concrete examples in the task instruction\ncan help workers better understand the task, especially for concepts that are\nabstract and confusing. We found a few workers completed most of the work, and\nour payment level appeared more attractive to workers from low-income\ncountries. In the future, we will further evaluate our results with reference\nto gold standard extractions, thus assessing the feasibility of tasking crowd\nworkers with extracting biomedical intervention information for systematic\nreviews."

Providing electrical\nconsumption information to household and make the consumption information\ntangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in\nhouseholds. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on\nelectrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy\nturning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is\npossible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in\norder to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the\nknowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.\nMonitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption\nand comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.\nHouseholds received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral\nchange associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It\nis also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption\ndisplay have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in\nhouseholds. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,\nhouse 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that\nfurther attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying\ndifferent type of monitor designs and implication of special designed\nstimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with\ntheir current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time\nperiods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for\nspecific consumption behaviors."

We propose to use crowdsourcing to augment early\nsketches with interactive behaviors generated, used, and reused by collective\n\"wizards-of-oz\" as opposed to a single wizard as in prior work (Davis et al.\n2007). This demo presents an extension of Apparition (Lasecki et al. 2015), a\ncrowd-powered prototyping tool that allows end users to create functional GUIs\nusing speech and sketch. In Apparition, crowd workers collaborate in real-time\non a shared canvas to refine the user-requested sketch interactively, and with\nthe assistance of the end users. Our demo extends this functionality to let\ncrowd workers \"demonstrate\" the canvas changes that are needed for a behavior\nand refine their demonstrations to improve the fidelity of interactive\nbehaviors. The system then lets workers \"remix\" these behaviors to make\ncreating future behaviors more efficient."

This invokes a major challenge of\naggregating multiple opinions received from different crowd workers for\nderiving the final judgment. Generally, opinion aggregation models deal with\nindependent opinions, which are given unanimously and are not visible to all.\nHowever, in many real-life cases, it is required to make the opinions public as\nsoon as they are received. This makes the opinions dependent and might\nincorporate some bias. In this paper, we address a novel problem, hereafter\ndenoted as dependent judgment analysis, and discuss the requirements for\ndeveloping an appropriate model to deal with this problem. The challenge\nremains to be improving the consensus by revealing true opinions."

    "summary": "Wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors have been successfully applied in\nmany medical and computer brain interface classifications. A common\ncharacteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,\nand hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any\npractical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG\nsensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the\nclassification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose\na directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve\nthis objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete\nundirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between\nany two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying\nthe system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a\nweight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed\nacyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the\nchannel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm\nutilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight\nof this path satisfies a predefined threshold. It has been demonstrated\nexperimentally that channel utilization has been reduced by 50% in the worst\ncase scenario for a three-state system and an EEG sensor with 14 channels; and\nthe best classification accuracy obtained is 81%."

We also administered five scales in\norder to assess different psychological traits. From the experiment, conducted\non 181 university students, emerged that conformity grows according to the\nambiguity of the task, but normative influence is significantly weaker in\nvirtual environments, if compared to face-to-face experiments. The analysed\npsycho-logical traits, however, result not to be relatable to conformity, and\nthey only affect the subjects' response times. From the ERP (Event-related\npotentials) analysis, we detected N200 and P300 components comparing the plots\nof conformist and non-conformist subjects, alongside with the detection of\ntheir Late Positive Potential, Readiness Potential, and Error-Related\nNegativity, which appear consistently different for the two typologies."

We\ntarget particularly older adults who are socially more isolated, physically\nless active, and with less chances of training in a gym. The virtual fitness\nenvironment, namely Gymcentral, was designed to enable and motivate older\nadults to follow personalised exercises from home, with a (heterogeneous) group\nof remote friends and under the remote supervision of a Coach. We take the\ntraining activity as an opportunity to create social interactions, by\ncomplementing training features with social instruments.

    "summary": "Both dialogue systems and chatbots aim at putting into action communication\nbetween humans and computers. However, instead of focusing on sophisticated\ntechniques to perform natural language understanding, as the former usually do,\nchatbots seek to mimic conversation. Since Eliza, the first chatbot ever,\ndeveloped in 1966, there were many interesting ideas explored by the chatbots'\ncommunity. Actually, more than just ideas, some chatbots' developers also\nprovide free resources, including tools and large-scale corpora. It is our\nopinion that this know-how and materials should not be neglected, as they might\nbe put to use in the human-computer communication field (and some authors\nalready do it). Thus, in this paper we present a historical overview of the\nchatbots' developments, we review what we consider to be the main contributions\nof this community, and we point to some possible ways of coupling these with\ncurrent work in the human-computer communication research line."

Current\naesthetics are described as visual properties that a drawing is required to\nhave to be visually pleasing. However, most of these aesthetics are originally\nproposed without consideration of graph structure information. Therefore their\nability in visually revealing graph structural features are not guaranteed and\nindeed mixed results have been reported in the literature regarding their\nimpact on user graph comprehension. In this paper, we propose to derive\naesthetics based on graph internal structural features. Further, graphs are\noften evaluated based on controlled experiments with simple perception tasks to\navoid possible confounding factors caused by complex tasks. This leaves their\nvalue in supporting complex tasks unevaluated. To fill this gap, we also\ndiscuss the possibility of applying evaluation methodologies used in the\nCognitive Load Theory research for graph evaluation."

In this paper, we study the facial expressions associated with\ninterest and its underlying and closely related components, namely, curiosity,\ncoping potential, novelty and complexity. To this end, we conducted an\nexperiment in which participants watched images and micro-videos while a\nfront-facing camera recorded their expressions. After watching each item they\nself-reported their level of interest, curiosity, coping potential and\nperceived novelty and complexity. Using an automated method, we tracked facial\naction units (AU) and studied the relationship between the presence of facial\nmovements with interest and its related components. We then tracked the facial\nlandmarks, e.g., corners of lips, and extracted features from each response. We\ntrained random forests regression models to detect the level of interest,\ncuriosity, and appraisals. We found a large difference between the way people\nreport and react to interesting visual content. The expressions in response to\nimages and micro-videos were not always pronounced depending on the\nparticipants. This makes the direct detection of interest from facial\nexpressions a challenging problem. With this work, for the first time, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of detecting cognitive appraisals from facial\nexpressions which will open the door for appraisal-driven emotion recognition\nmethods."

We review the requirements for such content\nformat and report on existing initiatives, some of our own, towards\nimplementing such content format."

    "summary": "Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through\nworkflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex\ngoals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams - familiarity\nwith other members - stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand\nnature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to\nassemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time\nconstraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for\nhighly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first\npresent a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd\nteams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar)\nteams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment\nwherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18\nminutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term,\nteam-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work."

This lack of more explicit guidance\ncan leave visualization researchers and practitioners vulnerable to unforeseen\nconstraints beyond the user's needs that can affect the validity of\nevaluations, or even lead to the premature termination of a project. Here we\nexplore two types of external constraints in depth, regulatory and\norganizational constraints, and describe how these constraints impact\nvisualization design and evaluation. By borrowing from techniques in software\ndevelopment, project management, and visualization research we recommend\nstrategies for identifying, mitigating, and evaluating these external\nconstraints through a design study methodology. Finally, we present an\napplication of those recommendations in a healthcare case study. We argue that\nby explicitly incorporating external constraints into visualization design and\nevaluation, researchers and practitioners can improve the utility and validity\nof their visualization solution and improve the likelihood of successful\ncollaborations with industries where external constraints are more present."

Reputation is one central example: crowdsourcing systems\ndepend on reputation scores from decentralized workers and requesters, but\nthese scores are notoriously inflated and uninformative. In this paper, we draw\ninspiration from historical worker guilds (e.g., in the silk trade) to design\nand implement crowd guilds: centralized groups of crowd workers who\ncollectively certify each other's quality through double-blind peer assessment.\nA two-week field experiment compared crowd guilds to a traditional\ndecentralized crowd work model. Crowd guilds produced reputation signals more\nstrongly correlated with ground-truth worker quality than signals available on\ncurrent crowd working platforms, and more accurate than in the traditional\nmodel."

The animation sub-group has been\nexploring so far several production quality levels and various animation\nprocedures in a number of available software.

Based on this, we\npresent Mosaic---an online community where illustrators share work-in-progress\nsnapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish. In an\nonline deployment and observational study, artists used Mosaic as a vehicle for\nreflecting on how they can improve their own creative process, developed a\nsocial norm of detailed feedback, and became less apprehensive of sharing early\nversions of artwork.

    "summary": "Crowdsourcing systems accomplish large tasks with scale and speed by breaking\nwork down into independent parts. However, many types of complex creative work,\nsuch as fiction writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because work is\ntightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the\noverall plot and vice versa. Taking inspiration from how expert authors write,\nwe propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds.\nWith this technique, the crowd loops between reflection, to select a high-level\ngoal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We\nembody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short\nfiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical\nNovel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing\nworkflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level\ngoals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work."

    "summary": "Screen-based Augmented Reality (AR) systems can be built as a window into the\nreal world as often done in mobile AR applications or using the Magic Mirror\nmetaphor, where users can see themselves with augmented graphics on a large\ndisplay. Such Magic Mirror systems have been used in digital clothing\nenvironments to create virtual dressing rooms, to teach human anatomy, and for\ncollaborative design tasks. The term Magic Mirror implies that the display\nshows the users enantiomorph, i.e. the mirror image, such that the system\nmimics a real-world physical mirror. However, the question arises whether one\nshould design a traditional mirror, or instead display the true mirror image by\nmeans of a non-reversing mirror? This is an intriguing perceptual question, as\nthe image one observes in a mirror is not a real view, as it would be seen by\nan external observer, but a reflection, i.e. a front-to-back reversed image. In\nthis paper, we discuss the perceptual differences between these two mirror\nvisualization concepts and present a first comparative study in the context of\nMagic Mirror anatomy teaching. We investigate the ability of users to identify\nthe correct placement of virtual anatomical structures in our screen-based AR\nsystem for two conditions: a regular mirror and a non-reversing mirror setup.\nThe results of our study indicate that the latter is more suitable for\napplications where previously acquired domain-specific knowledge plays an\nimportant role. The lessons learned open up new research directions in the\nfields of user interfaces and interaction in non-reversing mirror environments\nand could impact the implementation of general screen-based AR systems in other\ndomains."

To that end, we develop a system prototype which\nlearns-by-demonstration called HILC (Help, It Looks Confusing). Users train\nHILC to synthesize a task script by demonstrating the task, which produces the\nneeded screenshots and their corresponding mouse-keyboard signals. After the\ndemonstration, the user answers follow-up questions.\n  We propose a user-in-the-loop framework that learns to generate scripts of\nactions performed on visible elements of graphical applications. While pure\nprogramming-by-demonstration is still unrealistic, we use quantitative and\nqualitative experiments to show that non-programming users are willing and\neffective at answering follow-up queries posed by our system. Our models of\nevents and appearance are surprisingly simple, but are combined effectively to\ncope with varying amounts of supervision.\n  The best available baseline, Sikuli Slides, struggled with the majority of\nthe tests in our user study experiments. The prototype with our proposed\napproach successfully helped users accomplish simple linear tasks, complicated\ntasks (monitoring, looping, and mixed), and tasks that span across multiple\nexecutables. Even when both systems could ultimately perform a task, ours was\ntrained and refined by the user in less time."

One of the most used brain responses to implement non-invasive BCIs\nis the so called steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). This periodic\nresponse is generated when an user gazes to a light flickering at a constant\nfrequency. The SSVEP response can be detected in the user's\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) at the corresponding frequency of the attended\nflickering stimulus. In SSVEP based BCIs, multiple stimuli, flickering at\ndifferent frequencies, are commonly presented to the user, where to each\nstimulus is associated a command for an actuator. One of the limitations to a\nwider adoption of BCIs is given by the need of EEG acquisition devices and\nsoftware tools which are commonly not meant for end-user usage. In this work,\nexploiting state-of-the-art software tools, the use of a low cost easy to wear\nsingle electrode EEG device is demonstrated to be exploitable to implement\nsimple SSVEP based BCIs. The obtained results, although less impressive than\nthe ones obtainable with professional EEG equipment, are interesting in view of\npractical low cost BCI applications meant for end-users."

In a study, we show that AutoGain can produce\ngain functions with performance comparable to commercial designs in less than a\nhalf hour of active use.

In this paper, we focus\non the problem of estimating the vigilance of users using EEG and EOG signals.\nApproach. To improve the feasibility and wearability of vigilance estimation\ndevices for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for\nforehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the\nprincipal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from\ndifferent brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their\ncomplementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the\nvigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental\nstates of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional\nneural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic\ntemporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to\nestimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the\ntemporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a\nsingle modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance\nestimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the\nperformance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe\nthat theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency\nactivities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states.\nSignificance. The forehead setup allows for the simultaneous collection of EEG\nand EOG and achieves comparative performance using only four shared electrodes\nin comparison with the temporal and posterior sites."

    "summary": "In this paper we measure the step-wise latency in the pipeline of three kinds\nof interactive mobile video applications that are rapidly gaining popularity,\nnamely Remote Graphics Rendering (RGR) of which we focus on mobile cloud\ngaming, Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), and Mobile Virtual Reality (MVR). The\napplications differ from each other by the way in which the user interacts with\nthe application, i.e., video I/O and user controls, but they all share in\ncommon the fact that their user experience is highly sensitive to end-to-end\nlatency. Long latency between a user control event and display update renders\nthe application unusable. Hence, understanding the nature and origins of\nlatency of these applications is of paramount importance. We show through\nextensive measurements that control input and display buffering have a\nsubstantial effect on the overall delay. Our results shed light on the latency\nbottlenecks and the maturity of technology for seamless user experience with\nthese applications."

    "summary": "Image CAPTCHA, aiming at effectively distinguishing human users from\nmalicious script attacks, has been an important mechanism to protect online\nsystems from spams and abuses. Despite the increasing interests in developing\nand deploying image CAPTCHAs, the usability aspect of those CAPTCHAs has hardly\nbeen explored systematically. In this paper, the universal design factors of\nimage CAPTCHAs, such as image layouts, quantities, sizes, tilting angles and\ncolors were experimentally evaluated through the following four dimensions:\neye-tracking, efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. The cognitive\nprocesses revealed by eye-tracking indicate that the distribution of eye gaze\nis equally assigned to each candidate image and irrelevant to the variation of\nimage contents. In addition, the gazing plot suggests that more than 70% of the\nparticipants inspected CAPTCHA images row-by-row, which is more efficient than\nscanning randomly. Those four-dimensional evaluations essentially suggest that\nsquare and horizontal rectangle are the preferred layout; image quantities may\nnot exceed 16 while the image color is insignificant. Meanwhile, the image size\nand tilting angle are suggested to be larger than 55 pixels x 55 pixels and\nwithin -45~45 degrees, respectively. Basing on those usability experiment\nresults, we proposed a design guideline that is expected to be useful for\ndeveloping more usable image CAPTCHAs."

    "summary": "Text CAPTCHA has been an effective means to protect online systems from spams\nand abuses caused by automatic scripts which pretend to be human beings.\nHowever, nearly all the Text CAPTCHA designs in nowadays are based on English\ncharacters, which may not be the most user-friendly option for non-English\nspeakers. Therefore, under the background of globalization, there is an\nincreasing interest in designing local-language CAPTCHA, which is expected to\nbe more usable for native speakers. However, systematic studies on the\nusability of localized CAPTCHAs are rare, and a general procedure for the\ndesign of usable localized CAPTCHA is still unavailable. Here, we\ncomprehensively explored the design of CAPTCHAs based on Chinese characters\nfrom a usability perspective: cognitive processes of solving alphanumeric and\nChinese CAPTCHAs are analyzed, followed by a usability comparison of those two\ntypes of CAPTCHAs and the evaluation of intrinsic design factors of Chinese\nCAPTCHAs. It was found that Chinese CAPTCHAs could be equally usable comparing\nwith alphanumeric ones. Meanwhile, guidelines for the design of usable Chinese\nCAPTCHAs were also presented. Moreover, those design practices were also\nsummarized as a general procedure which is expected to be applicable for the\ndesign of CAPTCHAs based on other languages."

    "summary": "Social gaming is today a pervasive phenomenon. Driven by the advent of social\nnetworks and the digitization of game distribution. In this paper the impact of\ndigitization and so-cial networks such as Facebook on digital games is\nde-scribed and evaluated. This impact follows several vectors, including the\nintroduction of new game formats and extend-ing the traditional audiences for\ngames, which in turn has increased industrial revenue. The industry is in turn\nshaped by new business model such as Free-to-Play, digital distri-bution and\nthe use of viral social features. These changes do not only appear\nirreversible, but more importantly, play a part in shaping the future of\ndigital game design, notably for mobile devices. The paper presents new\nknowledge from controlled live experiments from a casual social game across\nFacebook and mobile platforms, finding positive re-turns by adding social\ngameplay features. This suggests that not only social network games, but also\ncasual mobile games can benefit from deeper social gameplay mechanics. Given\nthe impact of social features on gameplay, Game An-alytics will need to evolve\nto be able to handle requirements that arise from the introduction of social\nfeatures, e.g. how to measure engagement against social features and shaping\norganic and viral spreading of a game."

    "summary": "We present RFexpress! the first-ever network-edge based system to recognize\nemotion from movement, gesture and pose via Device-Free Activity Recognition\n(DFAR). With the proliferation of the IoT, also wireless access points are\ndeployed at increasingly dense scale. in particular, this includes vehicular\nnodes (in-car WiFi or Bluetooth), office (Wlan APs, WiFi printer or projector)\nand private indoor domains (home WiFi mesh, Wireless media access), as well as\npublic spaces (City/open WiFi, Cafes, shopping spaces). Processing\nRF-fluctuation at such edge-devices, enables environmental perception. In this\npaper, we focus on the distinction between neutral and agitated emotional\nstates of humans from RF-fluctuation at the wireless network edge in realistic\nenvironments. In particular, the system is able to detect risky driving\nbehaviour in a vehicular setting as well as spotting angry conversations in an\nindoor environment. We also study the effectiveness of edge-based DFAR emotion\nand activity recognition systems in real environments such as cafes, malls,\noutdoor and office spaces. We measure radio characteristics in these\nenvironments at different days and times and analyse the impact of variations\nin the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of DFAR emotion and activity\nrecognition. In a case study with 5 subjects, we then exploit the limits of\nedge-based DFAR by deriving critical SNR values under which activity and\nemotion recognition results are no longer reliable. In case studies with 8 and\n5 subjects the system further could achieve recognition accuracies of 82.9\\%\nand 64\\% for vehicular and stationary wireless network edge in the wild\n(non-laboratory noisy environments and non-scripted, natural individual\nbehaviour patterns)."

    "summary": "Despite the enormous interest in emotion classification from speech, the\nimpact of noise on emotion classification is not well understood. This is\nimportant because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone\ntechnology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the\noutside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate\nbackground noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for\nemotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently\nproposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion\nrecognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with\neight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16% smaller\nrun-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date.\nThis result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate\nfurther studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on\nsmartphones."

The automatic\nevaluation of emotional response, or affect, is a fascinating challenge with\nmany applications, including human-computer interaction, media tagging and\nhuman affect prediction. Our approach in addressing this problem is based on\nthe inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as captured by a depth\ncamera recording an individual's facial activity. Our contribution is two-fold:\nFirst, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which\nelicit a strong emotional response in a consistent manner across different\nindividuals. Each video was tagged by its characteristic emotional response\nalong 4 scales: \\emph{Valence, Arousal, Likability} and \\emph{Rewatch} (the\ndesire to watch again). The second contribution is a two-step prediction\nmethod, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of\ntagged video clips. Our method was able to successfully predict the\naforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, as well as to identify\nthe period of strongest emotional response in the viewing recordings, in a\nmethod that is blind to the video clip being watch, revealing a significantly\nhigh agreement between the recordings of independent viewers."

    "summary": "Previous work in the area of gesture production, has made the assumption that\nmachines can replicate \"human-like\" gestures by connecting a bounded set of\nsalient points in the motion trajectory. Those inflection points were\nhypothesized to also display cognitive saliency. The purpose of this paper is\nto validate that claim using electroencephalography (EEG). That is, this paper\nattempts to find neural signatures of gestures (also referred as placeholders)\nin human cognition, which facilitate the understanding, learning and repetition\nof gestures. Further, it is discussed whether there is a direct mapping between\nthe placeholders and kinematic salient points in the gesture trajectories.\nThese are expressed as relationships between inflection points in the gestures'\ntrajectories with oscillatory mu rhythms (8-12 Hz) in the EEG. This is achieved\nby correlating fluctuations in mu power during gesture observation with salient\nmotion points found for each gesture. Peaks in the EEG signal at central\nelectrodes (motor cortex) and occipital electrodes (visual cortex) were used to\nisolate the salient events within each gesture. We found that a linear model\npredicting mu peaks from motion inflections fits the data well. Increases in\nEEG power were detected 380 and 500ms after inflection points at occipital and\ncentral electrodes, respectively. These results suggest that coordinated\nactivity in visual and motor cortices is sensitive to motion trajectories\nduring gesture observation, and it is consistent with the proposal that\ninflection points operate as placeholders in gesture recognition."

    "summary": "User's intentions may be expressed through spontaneous gesturing, which have\nbeen seen only a few times or never before. Recognizing such gestures involves\none shot gesture learning. While most research has focused on the recognition\nof the gestures itself, recently new approaches were proposed to deal with\ngesture perception and production as part of the same problem. The framework\npresented in this work focuses on learning the process that leads to gesture\ngeneration, rather than mining the gesture's associated features. This is\nachieved using kinematic, cognitive and biomechanic characteristics of human\ninteraction. These factors enable the artificial production of realistic\ngesture samples originated from a single observation. The generated samples are\nthen used as training sets for different state-of-the-art classifiers.\nPerformance is obtained first, by observing the machines' gesture recognition\npercentages. Then, performance is computed by the human recognition from\ngestures performed by robots. Based on these two scenarios, a composite new\nmetric of coherency is proposed relating to the amount of agreement between\nthese two conditions. Experimental results provide an average recognition\nperformance of 89.2% for the trained classifiers and 92.5% for the\nparticipants. Coherency in recognition was determined at 93.6%. While this new\nmetric is not directly comparable to raw accuracy or other pure\nperformance-based standard metrics, it provides a quantifier for validating how\nrealistic the machine generated samples are and how accurate the resulting\nmimicry is."

    "summary": "The emotional response a person has to a living space is predominantly\naffected by light, color and texture as space-making elements. In order to\nverify whether this phenomenon could be replicated in a simulated environment,\nwe conducted a user study in a six-sided projected immersive display that\nutilized equivalent design attributes of brightness, color and texture in order\nto assess to which extent the emotional response in a simulated environment is\naffected by the same parameters affecting real environments. Since emotional\nresponse depends upon the context, we evaluated the emotional responses of two\ngroups of users: inactive (passive) and active (performing a typical daily\nactivity). The results from the perceptual study generated data from which\ndesign principles for a virtual living space are articulated. Such a space, as\nan alternative to expensive built dwellings, could potentially support new,\nminimalist lifestyles of occupants, defined as the neo-nomads, aligned with\ntheir work experience in the digital domain through the generation of emotional\nexperiences of spaces. Data from the experiments confirmed the hypothesis that\nperceivable emotional aspects of real-world spaces could be successfully\ngenerated through simulation of design attributes in the virtual space. The\nsubjective response to the virtual space was consistent with corresponding\nresponses from real-world color and brightness emotional perception. Our data\ncould serve the virtual reality (VR) community in its attempt to conceive of\nfurther applications of virtual spaces for well-defined activities."

In contrast to standard validation to\nprovide feedback for structured inputs (e.g., dates, email addresses), it is\ndifficult to provide timely, high quality, customized feedback for free-form\ntext input. While existing solutions based on crowdsourced feedback (e.g.,\nup-votes and comments) can eventually produce high quality feedback, they\nsuffer from high latency and costs, whereas fully automated approaches are\nlimited to syntactic feedback that does not address text content. We introduce\nDialectic, an end-to-end extensible system that simplifies the process of\ncreating, customizing, and deploying content-specific feedback for free-text\ninputs. Our main observation is that many services already have a corpus of\ncrowdsourced feedback that can be used to bootstrap a feedback system.\nDialectic initializes with a corpus of annotated free-form text, automatically\nsegments input text, and helps developers rapidly add domain-specific document\nquality features as well as content-specific feedback generation functions to\nprovide targeted feedback to user inputs. Our user study shows that Dialectic\ncan be used to create a feedback interface that produces an average of 14.4\\%\nquality improvement of product review text, over 3x better than a\nstate-of-the-art feedback system."

    "summary": "Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and\nin visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better\nmethods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated\nto effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and\ncounteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases\nin mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that\nsupports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In\nparticular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of\nbias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling\nactivists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in\nconversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform\nthat explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how people\nreacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by\ndiscussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems\nto identify and counteract the effects of news bias."

We identify relevant sources of uncertainty as well as the\nlimited ability of its accurate measurement, propose an uncertainty-aware\nmethodology for more evident evaluations of data mining approaches, and discuss\nits implications for existing quality assessment strategies.

    "summary": "In many areas of data mining, data is collected from humans beings. In this\ncontribution, we ask the question of how people actually respond to ordinal\nscales. The main problem observed is that users tend to be volatile in their\nchoices, i.e. complex cognitions do not always lead to the same decisions, but\nto distributions of possible decision outputs. This human uncertainty may\nsometimes have quite an impact on common data mining approaches and thus, the\nquestion of effective modelling this so called human uncertainty emerges\nnaturally.\n  Our contribution introduces two different approaches for modelling the human\nuncertainty of user responses. In doing so, we develop techniques in order to\nmeasure this uncertainty at the level of user inputs as well as the level of\nuser cognition. With support of comprehensive user experiments and large-scale\nsimulations, we systematically compare both methodologies along with their\nimplications for personalisation approaches. Our findings demonstrate that\nsignificant amounts of users do submit something completely different (action)\nthan they really have in mind (cognition). Moreover, we demonstrate that\nstatistically sound evidence with respect to algorithm assessment becomes quite\nhard to realise, especially when explicit rankings shall be built."

Most\nexisting research on action recognition has focused on discriminating between\ndifferent actions, however, the quality of executing an action has received\nlittle attention thus far. In this paper, we study the quality assessment of\ndriving behaviors and present WiQ, a system to assess the quality of actions\nbased on radio signals. This system includes three key components, a deep\nneural network based learning engine to extract the quality information from\nthe changes of signal strength, a gradient based method to detect the signal\nboundary for an individual action, and an activitybased fusion policy to\nimprove the recognition performance in a noisy environment. By using the\nquality information, WiQ can differentiate a triple body status with an\naccuracy of 97%, while for identification among 15 drivers, the average\naccuracy is 88%. Our results show that, via dedicated analysis of radio\nsignals, a fine-grained action characterization can be achieved, which can\nfacilitate a large variety of applications, such as smart driving assistants."

    "summary": "Every teacher understands that different students benefit from different\nactivities. Recent advances in data processing allow us to detect and use\nbehavioral variability for adapting to a student. This approach allows us to\noptimize learning process but does not focus on understanding it. Conversely,\nclassical findings in educational sciences allow us to understand the learner\nbut are hard to embed in a large scale adaptive system. In this study we design\nand build a framework to investigate when the two approaches coincide."

    "summary": "In the Google Play store, an introduction page is associated with every\nmobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including\nscreenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to\nidentify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore\nusers' perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The\nresults of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app\ndescription which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist\nsome guidelines about how to write a good app description to attract more\ndownloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile,\nthere is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we\nemploy the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the\napp descriptions' quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google\nPlay, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from\none (very poor) to five (very good). The participants are also requested to\nexplain every score's reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the\nattributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the\nquality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models\non a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector\nmachine model obtains up to 62% accuracy. In addition, we find that the\npermission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one\nfeature play key roles in defining a good app description."

In many\napplications, the temporal dependency information from consecutive decisions\nand contextual data can be used to provide a prior probability for the upcoming\ndecision. In this study we proposed two probabilistic graphical models (PGMs),\nusing context information and previously observed EEG evidences to estimate a\nprobability distribution over the decision space in graph based decision-making\nmechanism. In this approach, user moves a pointer to the desired vertex in the\ngraph in which each vertex represents an action. To select a vertex, a Select\ncommand, or a proposed probabilistic Selection criterion (PSC) can be used to\nautomatically detect the user intended vertex. Performance of different PGMs\nand Selection criteria combinations are compared over a keyboard based on a\ngraph layout.

    "summary": "As virtual reality (VR) emerges as a mainstream platform, designers have\nstarted to experiment new interaction techniques to enhance the user\nexperience. This is a challenging task because designers not only strive to\nprovide designs with good performance but also carefully ensure not to disrupt\nusers' immersive experience. There is a dire need for a new evaluation tool\nthat extends beyond traditional quantitative measurements to assist designers\nin the design process. We propose an EEG-based experiment framework that\nevaluates interaction techniques in VR by measuring intentionally elicited\ncognitive conflict. Through the analysis of the feedback-related negativity\n(FRN) as well as other quantitative measurements, this framework allows\ndesigners to evaluate the effect of the variables of interest. We studied the\nframework by applying it to the fundamental task of 3D object selection using\ndirect 3D input, i.e. tracked hand in VR. The cognitive conflict is\nintentionally elicited by manipulating the selection radius of the target\nobject. Our first behavior experiment validated the framework in line with the\nfindings of conflict-induced behavior adjustments like those reported in other\nclassical psychology experiment paradigms. Our second EEG-based experiment\nexamines the effect of the appearance of virtual hands. We found that the\namplitude of FRN correlates with the level of realism of the virtual hands,\nwhich concurs with the Uncanny Valley theory."

In this perspective\nmultimodality and adaptivity represent focal issues, enabling users to\ncommunicate more freely and naturally with automated systems.

In this paper, we\npropose a multimodal attribute grammar, that provides constructions both for\nrepresenting input symbols from different modalities and for modeling semantic\nand temporal features of multimodal input symbols, enabling the specification\nof multimodal languages.

    "summary": "A holographic display system is able to offer an immersive 3D experience with\na controllable focus cue that matches the depth information of virtual content.\nProper calibration of an OST-HMD must take into account the specific features\nof that HMD. Existing calibration methods, however, cannot fully capture the\noptical characteristics of holographic display systems. With the aid of\ntracking systems, it is possible to register rendered graphics with tracked\nobjects in the real world, providing an augmented reality experience for the\nusers. We propose a new calibration procedure to properly align the coordinate\nsystem of rendering with that of the tracker. In this paper, both internal and\nexternal tracking systems are studied; three models of the mapping from\ntracking space to display space are presented: isometric, affine and\nperspective transformation. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of\nour method. Additionally, in a novel approach, the implementation uses self\nlocalization and spatial mapping of the HMD with an external tracker to perform\nthis calibration, eliminating the requirement for line of sight from the HMD to\nthe object or tracker. Microsoft HoloLens is used as the holographic OST-HMD\nfor our experiments. The experimental results indicate an accuracy of up to 4\nmm in the average reprojection error for the general perspective case and\nsimilarly 4 mm in our objective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first OST-HMD calibration method that takes the holographic nature of\nthe display technology into account."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a method for identification of a user`s fixed string set\n(which can be a command/instruction set for a terminal or microprocessor). This\nmethod is fast and has very small memory requirements, compared to a\ntraditional full string storage and compare method. The user feeds characters\ninto a microcontroller via a keyboard or another microprocessor sends commands\nand the microcontroller hashes the input in order to identify valid commands,\nensuring no collisions between hashed valid strings, while applying further\ncriteria to narrow collision between random and valid strings. The method\nproposed narrows the possibility of the latter kind of collision, achieving\nsmall code and memory-size utilization and very fast execution. Hashing is\nachieved using additive & rotating hash functions in an iterative form, which\ncan be very easily implemented in simple microcontrollers and microprocessors.\nSuch hash functions are presented and compared according to their efficiency\nfor a given string/command set, using the program found in the appendix."

    "summary": "Speech is becoming increasingly popular as an interface modality, especially\nin hands- and eyes-busy situations where the use of a keyboard or mouse is\ndifficult. However, despite the fact that many have hailed speech as being\ninherently usable (since everyone already knows how to talk), most users of\nspeech input are left feeling disappointed by the quality of the interaction.\nClearly, there is much work to be done on the design of usable spoken\ninterfaces. We believe that there are two major problems in the design of\nspeech interfaces, namely, (a) the people who are currently working on the\ndesign of speech interfaces are, for the most part, not interface designers and\ntherefore do not have as much experience with usability issues as we in the CHI\ncommunity do, and (b) speech, as an interface modality, has vastly different\nproperties than other modalities, and therefore requires different usability\nmeasures."

    "summary": "We first discuss respective advantages of language interaction in virtual\nworlds and of using 3D images in dialogue systems. Then, we describe an example\nof a verbal interaction system in virtual reality: Ulysse. Ulysse is a\nconversational agent that helps a user navigate in virtual worlds. It has been\ndesigned to be embedded in the representation of a participant of a virtual\nconference and it responds positively to motion orders. Ulysse navigates the\nuser's viewpoint on his/her behalf in the virtual world. On tests we carried\nout, we discovered that users, novices as well as experienced ones have\ndifficulties moving in a 3D environment. Agents such as Ulysse enable a user to\ncarry out navigation motions that would have been impossible with classical\ninteraction devices. From the whole Ulysse system, we have stripped off a\nskeleton architecture that we have ported to VRML, Java, and Prolog. We hope\nthis skeleton helps the design of language applications in virtual worlds."

    "summary": "In recent years because of the advances in computer vision research, free\nhand gestures have been explored as means of human-computer interaction (HCI).\nTogether with improved speech processing technology it is an important step\ntoward natural multimodal HCI. However, inclusion of non-predefined continuous\ngestures into a multimodal framework is a challenging problem. In this paper,\nwe propose a structured approach for studying patterns of multimodal language\nin the context of a 2D-display control. We consider systematic analysis of\ngestures from observable kinematical primitives to their semantics as pertinent\nto a linguistic structure. Proposed semantic classification of co-verbal\ngestures distinguishes six categories based on their spatio-temporal deixis. We\ndiscuss evolution of a computational framework for gesture and speech\nintegration which was used to develop an interactive testbed (iMAP). The\ntestbed enabled elicitation of adequate, non-sequential, multimodal patterns in\na narrative mode of HCI. Conducted user studies illustrate significance of\naccounting for the temporal alignment of gesture and speech parts in semantic\nmapping. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of gesture/speech production\nsuggests syntactic organization of gestures at the lexical level."

This is because the environment information, in the form of the\nobjects and events in the application's run-time environment, cannot be used to\ninform parsing decisions unless the input sentence is semantically analyzed,\nbut this does not occur until after parsing in the single-tree semantic\narchitecture.

The PIPE (\"Personalization is\nPartial Evaluation\") modeling methodology represents interaction with an\ninformation space as a program. The program is then specialized to a user's\nknown interests or information seeking activity by the technique of partial\nevaluation. In this paper, we elaborate PIPE by considering requirements\nanalysis in the personalization lifecycle. We investigate the use of scenarios\nas a means of identifying and analyzing personalization requirements. As our\nfirst result, we show how designing a PIPE representation can be cast as a\nsearch within a space of PIPE models, organized along a partial order. This\nallows us to view the design of a personalization system, itself, as\nspecialized interpretation of an information space. We then exploit the\nunderlying equivalence of explanation-based generalization (EBG) and partial\nevaluation to realize high-level goals and needs identified in scenarios; in\nparticular, we specialize (personalize) an information space based on the\nexplanation of a user scenario in that information space, just as EBG\nspecializes a theory based on the explanation of an example in that theory. In\nthis approach, personalization becomes the transformation of information spaces\nto support the explanation of usage scenarios. An example application is\ndescribed."

While research in recommender systems grew out of information\nretrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and\nchallenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally\nbeen studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design\nperspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but\nrather cast within an informal community of users and social context.\nTherefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and\nthus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is\nunder-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a\nconnection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit\nthat recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended\nto connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or\nindirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.\nThus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring\npeople together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the\nconnection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as\nevaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address."

The prosodic features from the speech signal were coanalyzed with the\nvisual signal to learn the prior probability of co-occurrence of the prominent\nspoken segments with the particular kinematical phases of gestures. It was\nfound that the above co-analysis helps in detecting and disambiguating visually\nsmall gestures, which subsequently improves the rate of continuous gesture\nrecognition.

Although algorithms for community have a\nwidespread use in the Web, their application to portals or specific subsets of\nthe Web has not been much studied. In this paper, we propose a technique for\nlocal community identification that takes into account user access behavior\nderived from access logs of servers in the Web. The technique takes a departure\nfrom the existing community algorithms since it changes the focus of in terest,\nmoving from authors to users. Our approach does not use relations imposed by\nauthors (e.g. hyperlinks in the case of Web pages). It uses information derived\nfrom user accesses to a service in order to infer relationships. The\ncommunities identified are of great interest to content providers since they\ncan be used to improve quality of their services. We also propose an evaluation\nmethodology for analyzing the results obtained by the algorithm. We present two\ncase studies based on actual data from two services: an online bookstore and an\nonline radio. The case of the online radio is particularly relevant, because it\nemphasizes the contribution of the proposed algorithm to find out communities\nin an environment (i.e., streaming media service) without links, that represent\nthe relations imposed by authors (e.g. hyperlinks in the case of Web pages)."

The same Primary Numbers are\nserved to many different clients accessing the database: the ATLAS software\nframework Athena, the Geant3 heritage framework Atlsim, the Geant4 developers\nframework FADS/Goofy, the generator of XML output for detector description, and\nseveral end-user clients for interactive data navigation, including web-based\nbrowsers and ROOT. The choice of the MySQL database product for the\nimplementation provides additional benefits: the Primary Numbers database can\nbe used on the developers laptop when disconnected (using the MySQL embedded\nserver technology), with data being updated when the laptop is connected (using\nthe MySQL database replication)."

    "summary": "Multimodal interfaces are becoming increasingly important with the advent of\nmobile devices, accessibility considerations, and novel software technologies\nthat combine diverse interaction media. This article investigates systems\nsupport for web browsing in a multimodal interface. Specifically, we outline\nthe design and implementation of a software framework that integrates hyperlink\nand speech modes of interaction. Instead of viewing speech as merely an\nalternative interaction medium, the framework uses it to support out-of-turn\ninteraction, providing a flexibility of information access not possible with\nhyperlinks alone. This approach enables the creation of websites that adapt to\nthe needs of users, yet permits the designer fine-grained control over what\ninteractions to support. Design methodology, implementation details, and two\ncase studies are presented."

    "summary": "The problem of how people find information is studied extensively; however,\nthe problem of how people organize, re-use, and re-find information that they\nhave found is not as well understood. Recently, several projects have conducted\nin-situ studies to explore how people re-find and re-use information. Here, we\npresent results and observations from a controlled, laboratory study of\nrefinding information found on the web.\n  Our study was conducted as a collaborative exercise with pairs of\nparticipants. One participant acted as a retriever, helping the other\nparticipant re-find information by telephone. This design allowed us to gain\ninsight into the strategies that users employed to re-find information, and\ninto how domain artifacts and contextual information were used to aid the\nre-finding process. We also introduced the ability for users to add their own\nexplicitly artifacts in the form of making annotations on the web pages they\nviewed.\n  We observe that re-finding often occurs as a two stage, iterative process in\nwhich users first attempt to locate an information source (search), and once\nfound, begin a process to find the specific information being sought (browse).\nOur findings are consistent with research on waypoints; orienteering approaches\nto re-finding; and navigation of electronic spaces. Furthermore, we observed\nthat annotations were utilized extensively, indicating that explicitly added\ncontext by the user can play an important role in re-finding."

To make it\npractical for commercial development and easier to support autonomous paradigm\nimposed by ubiquitous information services, we made improvements based on\nReiter's standard situation calculus. First we explore the inherent\nrelationship between fluents and evolution: since not all fluents contribute to\nsystems' evolution and some fluents can be derived from some others, we define\nthose fluents that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional\npotential as decisive fluents, and then we prove that their successor states\nwrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. Then, within the\ncalculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the\nautonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including:\nvalidity fluents to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple\nalternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial\nacceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such\nalternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services. Our\napproach is demonstrated by a ubiquitous calendaring service, ACS, throughout\nthe paper."

The results indicate that users are adept at discerning\nwhen out-of-turn interaction is necessary in a particular task, and actively\ninterleaved it with browsing. However, users found cascading information across\ninformation-finding subtasks challenging. Therefore, this work not only\nimproves our understanding of out-of-turn interaction, but also suggests\nfurther opportunities to enrich browsing experiences for users."

    "summary": "Scientific research is highly dynamic. New areas of science continually\nevolve;others gain or lose importance, merge or split. Due to the steady\nincrease in the number of scientific publications it is hard to keep an\noverview of the structure and dynamic development of one's own field of\nscience, much less all scientific domains. However, knowledge of hot topics,\nemergent research frontiers, or change of focus in certain areas is a critical\ncomponent of resource allocation decisions in research labs, governmental\ninstitutions, and corporations. This paper demonstrates the utilization of\nKleinberg's burst detection algorithm, co-word occurrence analysis, and graph\nlayout techniques to generate maps that support the identification of major\nresearch topics and trends. The approach was applied to analyze and map the\ncomplete set of papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences (PNAS) in the years 1982-2001. Six domain experts examined and\ncommented on the resulting maps in an attempt to reconstruct the evolution of\nmajor research areas covered by PNAS."

A major impediment in interface development is that there is\ninadequate empirical evidence for the effects of culture in the usability\nengineering methods used for developing user interfaces. This paper presents a\ncontrolled study investigating the effects of culture on the effectiveness of\nstructured interviews in usability testing. The experiment consisted of\nusability testing of a website with two independent groups of Indian\nparticipants by two interviewers; one belonging to the Indian culture and the\nother to the Anglo-American culture. Participants found more usability problems\nand made more suggestions to an interviewer who was a member of the same\n(Indian) culture than to the foreign (Anglo-American) interviewer. The results\nof the study empirically establish that culture significantly affects the\nefficacy of structured interviews during international user testing. The\nimplications of this work for usability engineering are discussed."

Our algorithm is based on a face and eye model, deduced from\nanthropometric data. This approach allows us to use a single camera and\nrequires no cooperation from the user. Using a single image avoids the\ncomplexities associated with of a multi-camera system. Evaluation tests show\nthat our system is accurate, fast and can be used in a variety of applications,\nincluding ones where the user is unaware of the system."

In order to realize\nsuch a scalable application a new architecture has been developed that fully\norbits around language. In order to verify the soundness of that architecture a\nprogram has been build. Both architecture and program are called CommunSENS.\nThe main purpose of this paper is: - to list the relevant elements of the\narchitecture; - to give a visual presentation of how the program and its image\nof the world look like; - to give a visual presentation of how the image can be\nupdated.

Recently, the system was used to host a\ngraduate-level mathematics course at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada.\nThe course consisted of regular lectures and assignment problems.

The main strength of the new language is that it is purely visual:\n(i) It has no notion of variable, quantification, partiality, join, pattern\nmatching, regular expression, recursion, or any other construct proper to\nlogical, functional, or other database query languages and (ii) has a very\nnatural, strong, and intuitive design metaphor. The main operation is that of\ncopying and pasting in a schema tree.\n  We show that despite its simplicity, VCP precisely captures complex-value\nalgebra without powerset, or equivalently, monad algebra with union and\ndifference. Thus, its expressive power is precisely that of the language that\nis usually considered to play the role of relational algebra for complex-value\ndatabases."

    "summary": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used in introductory Computer\nScience to teach basic object-oriented design. However, there appears to be a\nlack of suitable software to support this task. Many of the available programs\nthat support UML focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Those\nthat were designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are\nmissing common and important features, such as multiple selection and\nundo/redo. There is a need for software that is tailored to an instructional\nenvironment and has all the useful and needed functionality for that specific\ntask. This is the purpose of minimUML. minimUML provides a minimum amount of\nUML, just what is commonly used in beginning programming classes, while\nproviding a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML was designed to\nsupport abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning and\nerror avoidance. In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through\ntext or freeform drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work.\nminimUML was developed with the goal of supporting ease of use, supporting\nnovice students, and a requirement of no prior-training for its use."

User\npreferences are automatically acquired, avoiding explicit feedback, and ranking\nis based on those preferences distilled to a user profile. NectaRSS uses the\nwell-known vector space model for user profiles and new documents, and compares\nthem using information-retrieval techniques, but introduces a novel method for\nuser profile creation and adaptation from users' past choices. The efficiency\nof the proposed method has been tested by embedding it into an intelligent\naggregator (RSS feed reader), which has been used by different and\nheterogeneous users. Besides, this paper proves that the ranking of newsitems\nyielded by NectaRSS improves its quality with user's choices, and its\nsuperiority over other algorithms that use a different information\nrepresentation method."

Several dimensions and questions\nconsidered as important (by the authors and/or by us) are addressed: What about\nthe \"interdisciplinary cognitive\" character of the approaches adopted by the\nauthors? Is design indeed a domain where the use of CBR is particularly\nsuitable? Are there important distinctions between CBR and other approaches?\nWhich types of knowledge -other than cases- is being, or might be, used in CBR\nsystems? With respect to cases: are there different \"types\" of case and\ndifferent types of case use? which formats are adopted for their\nrepresentation? do cases have \"components\"? how are cases organised in the case\nmemory? Concerning their retrieval: which types of index are used? on which\ntypes of relation is retrieval based? how does one retrieve only a selected\nnumber of cases, i.e., how does one retrieve only the \"best\" cases? which\nprocesses and strategies are used, by the system and by its user? Finally, some\nimportant aspects of CBR system development are shortly discussed: should CBR\nsystems be assistance or autonomous systems? how can case knowledge be\n\"acquired\"? what about the empirical evaluation of CBR systems? The conclusion\npoints out some lacking points: not much attention is paid to the user, and few\npapers have indeed adopted an interdisciplinary cognitive approach."

The\nphoto-sharing site Flickr, for example, allows users to upload photographs,\nview photos created by others, comment on those photos, etc. As is common to\nother social media sites, Flickr allows users to designate others as\n``contacts'' and to track their activities in real time. The contacts (or\nfriends) lists form the social network backbone of social media sites. We claim\nthat these social networks facilitate new ways of interacting with information,\ne.g., through what we call social browsing. The contacts interface on Flickr\nenables users to see latest images submitted by their friends. Through an\nextensive analysis of Flickr data, we show that social browsing through the\ncontacts' photo streams is one of the primary methods by which users find new\nimages on Flickr. This finding has implications for creating personalized\nrecommendation systems based on the user's declared contacts lists."

In parallel, virtual reality tools and interfaces are more and more\nefficient for suggesting to the user complex feelings, and creating in this way\nvarious levels of perceptions.

Additionally, annotations can be published or\nshared with a group of interested parties via well-organized repositories.\nAlthough highly sophisticated annotation systems exist both conceptually as\nwell as technologically, we still observe that their acceptance is somewhat\nlimited.

    "summary": "In the field of evaluation research, computer scientists live constantly upon\ndilemmas and conflicting theories. As evaluation is differently perceived and\nmodeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in\ndilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing\nand developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task.\nAdvancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is\neven harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense\nchallenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and\ncontroversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our\nfield if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning\nmodel and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task\nis to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy,\npsychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate\nevaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a\ndefinition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a\nsilent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional\nentities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules\nknown by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add\nanthropological inquiries to our research toolkit. The paper is organized\naround some elements of the social communication and how they convey new\ninsights to evaluation research for computer and related scientists. We found\nsome technical limitations and offer discussions on how we relate to technology\nat same time we establish expectancies and perceive others work."

One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the\ndevelopment of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,\nhas been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in\nthe testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the\nuser's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA\nhas been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and\nrenamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA\ntutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system\nre-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are\npresented in this paper."

    "summary": "Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique\nwhere spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct\nanalysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social\nvisualization applications. Information visualization researchers have\npreviously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in\nrevealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument\nis based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed\nsimultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other\nrepresentations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time\ncube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has\nnot been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a\nbetween-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response\ntimes when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a\nbaseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were\nlower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the\nparticipants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of\nthe dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as\nfast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.\nThese results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space\ntime cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal\npatterns."

    "summary": "We are communicating with computers on two different levels. On upper level\nwe have a very flexible system of windows: we can move them, resize, overlap or\nput side by side. At any moment we decide what would be the best view and\nreorganize the whole view easily. Then we start any application, go to the\ninner level, and everything changes. Here we are stripped of all the\nflexibility and can work only inside the scenario, developed by the designer of\nthe program. Interface will allow us to change some tiny details, but in\ngeneral everything is fixed: graphics is neither moveable, nor resizable, and\nthe same with controls. Author designed an extremely powerful mechanism of\nturning graphical objects and controls into moveable and resizable. This can\nnot only significantly improve the existing applications, but this will bring\nthe applications to another level. (To estimate the possible difference, try to\nimagine the Windows system without its flexibility and compare it with the\ncurrent one.) This article explains in details the construction and use of\nmoveable and resizable graphical objects."

    "summary": "Social networks are a prominent feature of many social media sites, a new\ngeneration of Web sites that allow users to create and share content. Sites\nsuch as Digg, Flickr, and Del.icio.us allow users to designate others as\n\"friends\" or \"contacts\" and provide a single-click interface to track friends'\nactivity. How are these social networks used? Unlike pure social networking\nsites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their\nonline professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for\nthe most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships.\nInstead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express\ntheir tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new\nsubmissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate\nnew ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing. Through\nan extensive analysis of data from Digg and Flickr, we show that social\nbrowsing is one of the primary usage modalities on these social media sites.\nThis finding has implications for how social media sites rate and personalize\ncontent."

The task of\nintegrating computing infrastructure into everyday life without making it\nexcessively invasive brings about tradeoffs between flexibility and robustness,\nefficiency and effectiveness, as well as autonomy and reliability. As the\nfeasibility of ubiquitous computing and its real potential for mass\napplications are still a matter of controversy, this chapter will look into the\nunderlying issues of resource management and authentication to discover how\nthese can be handled in a least invasive fashion.

Once used mainly\nfor simple functions such as logging, tracking and totalling information,\nspreadsheets with enhanced formulas are being used for complex calculative\nmodels. There are many software packages and tools which assist in detecting\nerrors within spreadsheets. There has been very little evidence of\ninvestigation into the spreadsheet risks associated with the main stream\noperations within an organisation. This study is a part of the investigation\ninto the means of mitigating risks associated with spreadsheet use within\norganisations. In this paper the authors present and analyse three proposed\nmodels for categorisation of spreadsheet use and the level of risks involved.\nThe models are analysed in the light of current knowledge and the general risks\nassociated with organisations."

The MM\ndecompiler translates a spreadsheet into an MM program which gives a concise\nsummary of its calculations, layout, and styling. This is valuable when trying\nto understand spreadsheets one has not seen before, and when checking for\nerrors. The MM compiler goes the other way, translating an MM program into a\nspreadsheet. This makes possible a new style of development, in which\nspreadsheets are generated from textual specifications. This can reduce error\nrates compared to working directly with the raw spreadsheet, and gives\nimportant facilities for code reuse. MM programs also offer advantages over\nExcel files for the interchange of spreadsheets."

This\nmay be because spreadsheet developers are overconfident in the accuracy of\ntheir spreadsheets. This conjecture is plausible because overconfidence is\npresent in a wide variety of human cognitive domains, even among experts. This\npaper describes two experiments in overconfidence in spreadsheet development.\nThe first is a pilot study to determine the existence of overconfidence. The\nsecond tests a manipulation to reduce overconfidence and errors. The\nmanipulation is modestly successful, indicating that overconfidence reduction\nis a promising avenue to pursue."

    "summary": "This paper explores the links between Knowledge Management and new\ncommunity-based models of the organization from both a theoretical and an\nempirical perspective. From a theoretical standpoint, we look at Communities of\nPractice (CoPs) and Knowledge Management (KM) and explore the links between the\ntwo as they relate to the use of information systems to manage knowledge. We\nbegin by reviewing technologically supported approaches to KM and introduce the\nidea of \"Systemes d'Aide a la Gestion des Connaissances\" SAGC (Systems to aid\nthe Management of Knowledge). Following this we examine the contribution that\ncommunal structures such as CoPs can make to intraorganizational KM and\nhighlight some of 'success factors' for this approach to KM that are found in\nthe literature. From an empirical standpoint, we present the results of a\nsurvey involving the Chief Knowledge Officers (CKOs) of twelve large French\nbusinesses; the objective of this study was to identify the factors that might\ninfluence the success of such approaches. The survey was analysed using\nthematic content analysis and the results are presented here with some short\nillustrative quotes from the CKOs. Finally, the paper concludes with some brief\nreflections on what can be learnt from looking at this problem from these two\nperspectives."

    "summary": "The stated aim of this conference is to debate the continuing evolution of IS\nin businesses and other organisations. This paper seeks to contribute to this\ndebate by exploring the concept of appropriation from a number of different\nepistemological, cultural and linguistic viewpoints to allow us to explore 'the\nblack box' of appropriation and to gain a fuller understanding of the term. At\nthe conceptual level, it will examine some of the different ways in which\npeople have attempted to explain the relationship between the objective and\nconcrete features of technology and the subjective and shifting nature of the\npeople and organisation within which that technology is deployed. At the\ncultural and linguistic level the paper will examine the notion as it is found\nin the Francophone literature, where the term has a long and rich history, and\nthe Anglophone literature where appropriation is seen as a rather more\nspecialist term. The paper will conclude with some observations on the ongoing\nnature of the debate, the value of reading beyond the literature with which one\nis familiar and the rewards that come from exploring different historical (and\nlinguistic) viewpoints."

These risks have been well documented and thoroughly\nresearched. With the advent of regulatory mandates such as SOX 404 and FDICIA\nin the U.S., and MiFID, Basel II and Combined Code in the UK and Europe,\nleading tax and audit firms are now recommending that organizations automate\ntheir internal controls over critical spreadsheets and other end-user computing\napplications, including Microsoft Access databases. At a minimum, auditors\nmandate version control, change control and access control for operational\nspreadsheets, with more advanced controls for critical financial spreadsheets.\nThis paper summarises the key issues regarding the establishment and\nmaintenance of control of Business Critical spreadsheets."

    "summary": "The concept of metaphor, in particular graphical (or visual) metaphor, is\ncentral to the field of information visualization. Information graphics and\ninteractive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical\ndevices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise\ndifficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This\npaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\ntheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\ninformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\nentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\nstructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\nprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\nphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\nprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\ntheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\nthese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\nstructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\nimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\nimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\nfor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\nand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\ninformation graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image\nschemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory\nof design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new\ninformation visualization techniques."

This\nallows the comparison of different metaheuristic algorithms for the considered\nproblem instances. Results are visualized by a graphical user interface showing\nthe distribution of solutions in outcome space as well as their corresponding\nGantt chart representation.\n  The identification of a most preferred solution from the set of efficient\nsolutions is supported by a module based on the aspiration interactive method\n(AIM). The decision maker successively defines aspiration levels until a single\nsolution is chosen.\n  After successfully competing in the finals in Ronneby, Sweden, the MOOPPS\nsoftware has been awarded the European Academic Software Award 2002\n(http://www.bth.se/llab/easa_2002.nsf)"

    "summary": "Legacy spreadsheets are both, an asset, and an enduring problem concerning\nspreadsheets in business. To make spreadsheets stay alive and remain correct,\ncomprehension of a given spreadsheet is highly important. Visualization\ntechniques should ease the complex and mindblowing challenges of finding\nstructures in a huge set of spreadsheet cells for building an adequate mental\nmodel of spreadsheet programs. Since spreadsheet programs are as diverse as the\npurpose they are serving and as inhomogeneous as their programmers, to find an\nappropriate representation or visualization technique for every spreadsheet\nprogram seems futile. We thus propose different visualization and\nrepresentation methods that may ease spreadsheet comprehension but should not\nbe applied with all kind of spreadsheet programs. Therefore, this paper\nproposes to use (complexity) measures as indicators for proper visualization."

    "summary": "There have been many articles and mishaps published about the risks of\nuncontrolled spreadsheets in today's business environment, including\nnon-compliance, operational risk, errors, and fraud all leading to significant\nloss events. Spreadsheets fall into the realm of end user developed\napplications and are often absent the proper safeguards and controls an IT\norganization would enforce for enterprise applications. There is also an\noverall lack of software programming discipline enforced in how spreadsheets\nare developed. However, before an organization can apply proper controls and\ndiscipline to critical spreadsheets, an accurate and living inventory of\nspreadsheets across the enterprise must be created, and all critical\nspreadsheets must be identified. As such, this paper proposes an automated\napproach to the initial stages of the spreadsheet management lifecycle -\ndiscovery, inventory and risk assessment. Without the use of technology, these\nphases are often treated as a one-off project. By leveraging technology, they\nbecome a sustainable business process."

There are several reasons for doing\nso: First, the taxonomy has been widely used. Therefore, it should have\nscrutiny; Second, the taxonomy has not been widely available in its original\nform and most users refer to secondary sources. Consequently, they often equate\nthe taxonomy with the simplified extracts used in particular experiments or\nfield studies; Third, perhaps as a consequence, most users use only a fraction\nof the taxonomy. In particular, they tend not to use the taxonomy's life-cycle\ndimension; Fourth, the taxonomy has been tested against spreadsheets in\nexperiments and spreadsheets in operational use. It is time to review how it\nhas fared in these tests; Fifth, the taxonomy was based on the types of\nspreadsheet errors that were known to the authors in the mid-1990s. Subsequent\nexperience has shown that the taxonomy needs to be extended for situations\nbeyond those original experiences; Sixth, the omission category in the taxonomy\nhas proven to be too narrow. Although this paper will focus on the\nPanko-Halverson taxonomy, this does not mean that that it is the only possible\nerror taxonomy or even the best error taxonomy."

    "summary": "This paper contributes to the human-machine interface community in two ways:\nas a critique of the closed-loop AC (augmented cognition) approach, and as a\nway to introduce concepts from complex systems and systems physiology into the\nfield. Of particular relevance is a comparison of the inverted-U (or Gaussian)\nmodel of optimal performance and multidimensional fitness landscape model.\nHypothetical examples will be given from human physiology and learning and\nmemory. In particular, a four-step model will be introduced that is proposed as\na better means to characterize multivariate systems during behavioral processes\nwith complex dynamics such as learning. Finally, the alternate approach\npresented herein is considered as a preferable design alternate in\nhuman-machine systems. It is within this context that future directions are\ndiscussed."

    "summary": "The Semantic Web is becoming more and more a reality, as the required\ntechnologies have reached an appropriate level of maturity. However, at this\nstage, it is important to provide tools facilitating the use and deployment of\nthese technologies by end-users. In this paper, we describe EdHibou, an\nautomatically generated, ontology-based graphical user interface that\nintegrates in a semantic portal. The particularity of EdHibou is that it makes\nuse of OWL reasoning capabilities to provide intelligent features, such as\ndecision support, upon the underlying ontology. We present an application of\nEdHibou to medical decision support based on a formalization of clinical\nguidelines in OWL and show how it can be customized thanks to an ontology of\ngraphical components."

    "summary": "When users want to establish wireless communication between/among their\ndevices, the channel has to be bootstrapped first. To prevent any malicious\ncontrol of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to\nbe authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure\ncommunication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred\nto as \"Secure Device Pairing\". When there is no prior security context, e.g.,\nshared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing\nrequires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves\nleveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data\nexchanged over the insecure wireless channel.\n  We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to\npairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,\nwe consider more general and emerging \"two-user\" scenarios, where two different\nusers establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of\npairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are\napplicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the\nmethods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate\nthe usability of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for\nusers, in terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our\nwork sheds light on the applicability and usability of pairing methods for\nemerging two-user scenarios, a topic largely ignored so far."

We also wanted to\nmotivate our modeling and design discussions with real-world examples of\ncollaboration. We discussed examples from the healthcare domain, students,\nfaculty members, the military, and businesses such as pharmaceutical companies\nthat conduct research.\n  We discussed several models of collaborative information seeking, including\nsense-making, communication, and information seeking theory based on Marcia\nBates' Berrypicking theory.\n  Finally, presenters described several systems that implement various aspects\nof collaboration, including using search paths, simulations of user behavior to\nmodel system performance, and characterizing properties of groups that lead to\nmore effective collaboration."

    "summary": "Spreadsheet programmers often implement contingent logic using a nested-IF\nformula even though this technique is difficult to test and audit and is\nbelieved to be risky. We interpret the programming of contingent logic in\nspreadsheets in the context of traditional computer programming. We investigate\nthe \"lookup technique\" as an alternative to nested-IF formulas, describe its\nbenefits for testing and auditing, and define its limitations. The lookup\ntechnique employs four distinct principles: 1) make logical tests visible; 2)\nmake outcomes visible; 3) make logical structure visible; and 4) replace a\nmulti-function nested-IF formula with a single-function lookup formula. It can\nbe used only for certain simple contingent logic. We describe how the\nprinciples can be applied in more complex situations, and suggest avenues for\nfurther research."

It focuses mainly on two\nimportant issues: 1 - select in all that may be said about such complex tools,\nwhat is prior to know and to teach, i.e. what leads to autonomy in using but\nalso to autonomy in learning (because everything cannot be taught) and 2 - show\nhow concepts are closely related to good formatting considerations. A method\nbased on the \"invariants of information processing\" is outlined, partially\nillustrated and an implementation is described throughout a course designed for\nstudents preparing a master in Education Sciences."

We explain how we analyze screen\ncaptures and give the main results we have obtained using this specific\nmethodology with secondary school students (N=24). Transcription provides\ngeneral characteristics: time, sequence of performed tasks, unsuccessful\nattempts and user preferences. Analysis reveals preferred modes of actions\n(toolbar buttons or menu commands), ways of writing formulas, and typical\napproaches in searching for solutions. Time, rhythm and density appear to be\npromising indicators. We think such an approach (to analyze screen captures)\ncould be used with more advanced spreadsheet users."

Many tools and techniques have been developed which help reduce\nrisks associate with creating and maintaining spreadsheet. However, little\nconsideration has been given to reducing the risks of routine usage by the\n\"consumers\" - for example when entering and editing data. EASA's solution,\navailable commercially, ensures that any routine process involving spreadsheets\ncan be executed rapidly and without errors by the end-users, often with a\nsignificant reduction in manual effort.

Here, we\nexploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that\nvoluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments,\nsubjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups in order to\nplay a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature\nallowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and\nuncooperative behavior spreads from person to person to person. We show that,\nin both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with\npunishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members'\ncontribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were\nnot a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists\nfor multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person\nto person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional\ncontribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled\nover the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or\nindirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These are the first\nresults to show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human\nsocial networks."

Paraplegic peoples are\nparticularly subjects to pressure sores because of long-time seated postures\nand sensory deprivation at the lower limbs.

The\nsystem consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and\nactuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit\nembedded in a dental retainer with electrodes put in contact with the tongue.\nThe principle consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated\nover long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce\nthese overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional\ninformation transmitted by the TDU. Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily\nparticipated in this study.

    "summary": "Search engines are nowadays one of the most important entry points for\nInternet users and a central tool to solve most of their information needs.\nStill, there exist a substantial amount of users' searches which obtain\nunsatisfactory results. Needless to say, several lines of research aim to\nincrease the relevancy of the results users retrieve. In this paper the authors\nframe this problem within the much broader (and older) one of information\noverload. They argue that users' dissatisfaction with search engines is a\ncurrently common manifestation of such a problem, and propose a different angle\nfrom which to tackle with it. As it will be discussed, their approach shares\ngoals with a current hot research topic (namely, learning to rank for\ninformation retrieval) but, unlike the techniques commonly applied in that\nfield, their technique cannot be exactly considered machine learning and,\nadditionally, it can be used to change the search engine's response in\nreal-time, driven by the users behavior. Their proposal adapts concepts from\nSwarm Intelligence (in particular, Ant Algorithms) from an Information Foraging\npoint of view. It will be shown that the technique is not only feasible, but\nalso an elegant solution to the stated problem; what's more, it achieves\npromising results, both increasing the performance of a major search engine for\ninformational queries, and substantially reducing the time users require to\nanswer complex information needs."

    "summary": "Social tagging systems have recently developed as a popular method of data\norganisation on the Internet. These systems allow users to organise their\ncontent in a way that makes sense to them, rather than forcing them to use a\npre-determined and rigid set of categorisations. These folksonomies provide\nwell populated sources of unstructured tags describing web resources which\ncould potentially be used as semantic index terms for these resources. However\ngetting people to agree on what tags best describe a resource is a difficult\nproblem, therefore any feature which increases the consistency and stability of\nterms chosen would be extremely beneficial. We investigate how the provision of\na tag cloud, a weighted list of terms commonly used to assist in browsing a\nfolksonomy, during the tagging process itself influences the tags produced and\nhow difficult the user perceived the task to be. We show that illustrating the\nmost popular tags to users assists in the tagging process and encourages a\nstable and consistent folksonomy to form."

    "summary": "Crowdsourcing is a form of \"peer production\" in which work traditionally\nperformed by an employee is outsourced to an \"undefined, generally large group\nof people in the form of an open call.\" We present a model of workers supplying\nlabor to paid crowdsourcing projects. We also introduce a novel method for\nestimating a worker's reservation wage--the smallest wage a worker is willing\nto accept for a task and the key parameter in our labor supply model. It shows\nthat the reservation wages of a sample of workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk\n(AMT) are approximately log normally distributed, with a median wage of\n$1.38/hour. At the median wage, the point elasticity of extensive labor supply\nis 0.43. We discuss how to use our calibrated model to make predictions in\napplied work. Two experimental tests of the model show that many workers\nrespond rationally to offered incentives. However, a non-trivial fraction of\nsubjects appear to set earnings targets. These \"target earners\" consider not\njust the offered wage--which is what the rational model predicts--but also\ntheir proximity to earnings goals. Interestingly, a number of workers clearly\nprefer earning total amounts evenly divisible by 5, presumably because these\namounts make good targets."

Economic theory and empirical evidence strongly suggest that\nthis kind of access improves human welfare. However, critics claim that abuses\nare endemic in these markets and that employers exploit unprotected, vulnerable\nworkers. I investigate part of this claim using a randomized, paired survey in\nwhich I ask workers in an online labor market (Amazon Mechanical Turk) how they\nperceive online employers and employers in their host country in terms of\nhonesty and fairness. I find that, on average, workers perceive the collection\nof online employers as slightly fairer and more honest than offline employers,\nthough the effect is not significant. Views are more polarized in the online\nemployer case, with more respondents having very positive views of the online\ncollection of employers."

In this paper\nwe focus on the importance of creating speech database at syllable units and\nidentifying minimum text to be considered while training any speech recognition\nsystem. There are systems developed for continuous speech recognition in\nEnglish and in few Indian languages like Hindi and Tamil. This paper gives the\nstatistical details of syllables in Telugu and its use in minimizing the search\nspace during recognition of speech. The minimum words that cover maximum\nsyllables are identified. This words list can be used for preparing a small\ntext which can be used for collecting speech sample while training the\ndictation system. The results are plotted for frequency of syllables and the\nnumber of syllables in each word. This approach is applied on the CIIL Mysore\ntext corpus which is of 3 million words."

    "summary": "Online social networking has quickly become one of the most common activities\nof Internet users. As social networks evolve, they encourage users to share\nmore information, requiring the users, in turn, to place more trust into social\nnetworks. Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide an environment that can return\nownership of information, trust, and control to the users, away from\ncentralized third-party social networks.\n  In this paper, we present a novel concept, social profile overlays, which\nenable users to share their profile only with trusted peers in a scalable,\nreliable, and private manner. Each user's profile consists of a unique private,\nsecure overlay, where members of that overlay have a friendship with the\noverlay owner. Profile data is made available without regard to the online\nstate of the profile owner through the use of the profile overlay's distributed\ndata store. Privacy and security are enforced through the use of a public key\ninfrastructure (PKI), where the role of certificate authority (CA) is handled\nby the overlay owner and each member of the overlay has a CA-signed\ncertificate. All members of the social network join a common public or\ndirectory overlay facilitating friend discovery and bootstrap connections into\nprofile overlays. We define interfaces and present tools that can be used to\nimplement this system, as well as explore some of the challenges related to it."

The social space is modeled with an agent network, where each agent\nstands for a member of the community and has knowledge about expertise and\npersonal characteristics of some other members. An agent can gather\ninformation, using its social \"connections\", to find community members most\nsuitable to communicate to in a specific situation defined by the system's\nuser. The system then deploys its multimodal interface, which \"maps\" the social\nspace onto a representation of the relevant physical space, to locate the\npotential interlocutors and advise the user on an efficient communication\nstrategy for the given community."

    "summary": "Gameplay research about experiential phenomena is a challenging undertaking,\ngiven the variety of experiences that gamers encounter when playing and which\ncurrently do not have a formal taxonomy, such as flow, immersion, boredom, and\nfun. These informal terms require a scientific explanation. Ludologists also\nacknowledge the need to understand cognition, emotion, and goal- oriented\nbehavior of players from a psychological perspective by establishing rigorous\nmethodologies. This paper builds upon and extends prior work in an area for\nwhich we would like to coin the term \"affective ludology.\" The area is\nconcerned with the affective measurement of player-game interaction. The\nexperimental study reported here investigated different traits of gameplay\nexperience using subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e.,\npsychophysiological) measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game level\ndesign modifications while measures such as electromyography (EMG),\nelectrodermal activity (EDA) were taken and questionnaire responses were\ncollected. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated\nsignificant high-arousal positive affect emotions. This method shows that\nemotional patterns emerge from different level designs, which has great\npotential for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be\ngenerated together with self- reported subjective player experience\ndescriptions."

The\nunderlying objective is to understand how to select search results presentation\nfor tasks and user contexts. Twenty three participants conducted four search\ntasks of two types and used two interfaces (List and Overview) to refine and\nexamine search results. Clickthrough data were recorded. This controlled study\nemployed a mixed model design with two within-subject factors (task and\ninterface) and two between-subject factors (two cognitive abilities: memory\nspan and verbal closure). Quantitative analyses were carried out by means of\nthe statistical package SPSS. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance\nwith repeated measures and non-parametric tests were performed on the collected\ndata. The overview of search results appeared to have benefited searchers in\nseveral ways. It made them faster; it facilitated formulation of more effective\nqueries and helped to assess search results. Searchers with higher cognitive\nabilities were faster in the Overview interface and in less demanding\nsituations (on simple tasks), while at the same time they issued about the same\nnumber of queries as lower-ability searchers. In more demanding situations (on\ncomplex tasks and in the List interface), the higher ability searchers expended\nmore search effort, although they were not significantly slower than the lower\nability people in these situations. The higher search effort, however, did not\nresult in a measurable improvement of task outcomes for high-ability searchers.\nThese findings have implications for the design of search interfaces. They\nsuggest benefits of providing result overviews. They also suggest the\nimportance of considering cognitive abilities in the design of search results'\npresentation and interaction."

So, only\noption is to capture the intuition of the user and provide them with the\nrecommendation list.

Web master should use web usage mining method to capture\nintuition. A WUM is designed to operate on web server logs which contain user's\nnavigation. Hence, recommendation system using WUM can be used to forecast the\nnavigation pattern of user and recommend those to user in a form of\nrecommendation list. In this paper, we propose a two tier architecture for\ncapturing users intuition in the form of recommendation list containing pages\nvisited by user and pages visited by other user's having similar usage profile.\nThe practical implementation of proposed architecture and algorithm shows that\naccuracy of user intuition capturing is improved."

The brain activity of an individual is monitored and\ntransmitted to a remote location (e.g. by satellite). At the remote location,\nthe monitored brain activity is compared with pre-recorded normalized brain\nactivity curves, waveforms, or patterns to determine if a match or substantial\nmatch is found. If such a match is found, then the computer at the remote\nlocation determines that the individual was attempting to communicate the word,\nphrase, or thought corresponding to the matched stored normalized signal."

Easy to carry, easy to use and easy\nto buy, smart phones with certain software are of great advantage.\nConsequently, mobile social networking (MSN) systems have emerged rapidly,\nbeing a revolution for our everyday life. Based on the analysis of general\nrequirements of MSN and location-based services (LBS), this paper presents the\ndesign of iZone, a mobile social networking system, as well as a prototype\nimplementation. This platform exploits mobile GIS (Geographic Information\nSystems), LBS and J2ME technologies, combining geographical data to display map\non mobile phones.

The Virtual\nObservatory, now under development, aims to make all these data accessible\nthrough a uniform set of interfaces. This chapter also describes the scientific\nneed for one common image processing task, that of composing individual images\ninto large scale mosaics and introduces Montage as a tool for this task.\nMontage, as distributed, can be used in four ways: as a single thread/process\non a single CPU, in parallel using MPI to distribute similar tasks across a\nparallel computer, in parallel using grid tools (Pegasus/DAGMan) to distributed\ntasks across a grid, or in parallel using a script-driven approach (Swift). An\non-request web based Montage service is available for users who do not need to\nbuild a local version. We also introduce some work on a new scripted version of\nMontage, which offers ease of customization for users. Then, we discuss various\nideas where Web 2.0 technologies can help the Montage community."

    "summary": "We present an empirical study of user activity in online BBC discussion\nforums, measured by the number of posts written by individual debaters and the\naverage sentiment of these posts. Nearly 2.5 million posts from over 18\nthousand users were investigated. Scale free distributions were observed for\nactivity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The\nnumber of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with\nthread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions\nrather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that\nmost posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual\nthreads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average\nemotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by\nnegative comments. An agent based computer simulation model has been used to\nreproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system. The model\nstresses the role of discussions between users, especially emotionally laden\nquarrels between supporters of opposite opinions, and represents many observed\nstatistics of the forum."

Typically,\nexcept for some rare occasions, documentary producers and computer scientists\nor digital artists that do computer graphics are relatively far apart in their\ndomains and rarely intercommunicate to have a joint production; yet it happens,\nand perhaps more so in the present and the future.\n  We attempt to classify the documentaries on the amount and techniques of\ncomputer graphics used for documentaries. We come up with the initial\ncategories such as \"plain\" (no graphics), \"in-between\", \"all-out\" -- nearly\n100% of the documentary consisting of computer-generated imagery. Computer\ngraphics can be used to enhance the scenery, fill in the gaps in the missing\nstoryline pieces, or animate between scenes. It can incorporate stereoscopic\neffects for higher viewer impression as well as interactivity aspects. It can\nalso be used simply in old archived image and film restoration."

    "summary": "Displays based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology are\nappearing on many mobile devices. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED\ndisplays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In\nparticular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has\nmade them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of\nbright colors.\n  To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and\nrealization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages\nwith power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by\nthe findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with\nimportant options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time,\nand accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a\nbrowser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is\nable to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and\nreduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable\ndelay."

For this\nresearch, the positions of objects, images element and texts element are\ndefined as objects in a web page interface. Mandarin learning web pages are\nused in this research. These learning web pages comprised of main pages,\nlearning pages and exercise pages, on the first author's E-portfolio web site.\nThe objects of the web pages were manipulated in order to produce the desired\naesthetic values. The six aesthetics related elements used are balance,\nequilibrium, symmetry, sequence, rhythm, as well as order and complexity.\nResults from the research showed that the ranking of the aesthetics values of\nthe web page interfaces measured of the users were congruent with the expected\nperceptions of our designed Mandarin learning web page interfaces (reported\nalso in [18]). Thus, it implies that the subjectivity of aesthetics can be\nmeasured in an objective manner. For further understanding on our effort in\ndoing aesthetics measurement, we discussed in details the object modelling used\nas well as the process in developing this application. We also explained the\nsteps on how to run our application. Additionally, the strength and the\nweakness of our SDA application shared in this paper suggest that there is\nstill room for the improvement for aesthetics measurement."

In addition,\nthe visual appearance is important in getting attentions of the users.\nMoreover, it was found that those screens, which were perceived as\naesthetically pleasing, were having a better usability. Usability might be a\nstrong basic in relating to the applicability for learning, and in this study\npertaining to Mandarin learning. It was also found that aesthetically pleasing\nlayouts of web page would motivate students in Mandarin learning The Mandarin\nLearning web pages were manipulated according to the desired aesthetic\nmeasurements. GUI aesthetic measuring method was used for this purpose. The\nAesthetics-Measurement Application (AMA) accomplished with six aesthetic\nmeasures was developed and used. On top of it, questionnaires were distributed\nto the users to gather information on the students' perceptions on the\naesthetic aspects and learning aspects. Respondents for this study were\nstudents taking Mandarin course level I at UiTM Terengganu. A significant\ncorrelation of the aesthetic aspect was found with its relevance to Mandarin\nlearning. In summary, aesthetics should not be ignored or overlooked in\ndesigning effective learning interfaces for educational purposes."

    "summary": "The emerging need for qualitative approaches in context-aware information\nprocessing calls for proper modeling of context information and efficient\nhandling of its inherent uncertainty resulted from human interpretation and\nusage. Many of the current approaches to context-awareness either lack a solid\ntheoretical basis for modeling or ignore important requirements such as\nmodularity, high-order uncertainty management and group-based\ncontext-awareness. Therefore, their real-world application and extendability\nremains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based\ncontext-awareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory\nfor modeling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of\ncontext which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between\nmembers of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer\narchitecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with\nwords (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed\nusing a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that\nthe proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness\nby offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a\nservice-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware,\ngroup-based and platform-independent access to information systems."

The merging of the real world model and\ndigital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the\nwhole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality\nis the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable\ndigital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using\nidentification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not\nnecessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real\nworld model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of\noutlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the\ncamera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of\nthe article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and\norientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is\ngeneralized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in\nspace. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the\ndescription of representation of their position and orientation be means of\ntransformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical\nobjects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D)."

    "summary": "The study is from a base of accident scenarii in rail transport (feedback) in\norder to develop a tool to share build and sustain knowledge and safety and\nsecondly to exploit the knowledge stored to prevent the reproduction of\naccidents / incidents. This tool should ultimately lead to the proposal of\nprevention and protection measures to minimize the risk level of a new\ntransport system and thus to improve safety. The approach to achieving this\ngoal largely depends on the use of artificial intelligence techniques and\nrarely the use of a method of automatic learning in order to develop a\nfeasibility model of a software tool based on case based reasoning (CBR) to\nexploit stored knowledge in order to create know-how that can help stimulate\ndomain experts in the task of analysis, evaluation and certification of a new\nsystem."

It is a necessity\nfor educators to come up with a layout for learning that can be accessed\nthrough mobile devices. These learning materials should consist of good quality\nlearning theories and accurate instructional layout in order to maintain the\nlearning as effective as possible. It is important to follow certain strategies\nthat can help the developers for M-learning applications.

Our analysis reveals\nthat, though the \"informational\" use of Facebook is still significant,\nnonprofit organizations are better at using Facebook to strategically engage\ntheir stakeholders via \"dialogic\" and \"community-building\" practices than they\nhave been with traditional websites. The adoption of social media seems to have\nengendered new paradigms of public engagement."

Traditional 2D desktop user\ninterface elements have been developed to solve this task, but such concepts do\nnot map well to the interaction devices available in Virtual Reality\nenvironments.\n  In this paper, we propose an intuitive user interface for Volume Rendering\nspecifically designed for Virtual Reality environments. The proposed interface\nallows transfer function design and refinement based on intuitive two-handed\noperation of Wand-like controllers. Additional interaction modes such as\nnavigation and clip plane manipulation are supported as well.\n  The system is implemented using the Sony PlayStation Move controller system.\nThis choice is based on controller device capabilities as well as application\nand environment constraints.\n  Initial results document the potential of our approach."

    "summary": "This chapter reviews empirical evidence bearing on the design of online\nforums for deliberative civic engagement. Dimensions of design are defined for\ndifferent aspects of the deliberation: its purpose, the target population, the\nspatiotemporal distance separating participants, the communication medium, and\nthe deliberative process to be followed. After a brief overview of criteria for\nevaluating different design options, empirical findings are organized around\ndesign choices. Research has evolved away from treating technology for online\ndeliberation dichotomously (either present or not) toward nuanced findings that\ndifferentiate between technological features, ways of using them, and cultural\nsettings. The effectiveness of online deliberation depends on how well the\ncommunicative environment is matched to the deliberative task. Tradeoffs, e.g.\nbetween rich and lean media and between anonymous and identifiable\nparticipation, suggest different designs depending on the purpose and\nparticipants. Findings are limited by existing technologies, and may change as\ntechnologies and users co-evolve."

    "summary": "This research explores the accessibility issues with regard to the e-commerce\nwebsites in developing countries, through a subjective study of Sri Lankan\nhotel websites. A web survey and a web content analysis were conducted as the\nmethods to elicit data on web accessibility. Factors preventing accessibility\nwere hypothesized as an initial experiment. Hazardous design elements are\nidentified through web content analysis, the results of which are utilized to\ndevelop specific implications for improving web accessibility. The hypothesis\ntests show that there is no significant correlation between accessibility and\ngeographical or economic factors. However, physical impairments of users have a\nconsiderable influence on the accessibility. Especially, visual and mobility\nimpaired users experience poor accessibility. Poor readability and less\nnavigable page designs are two observable issues, which pose threats to\naccessibility. The lack of conformance to W3C accessibility guidelines and the\npoor design process are the specific shortcomings which reduce the overall\naccessibility. Guidelines aim to improve the accessibility of sites with a\nstrategic focus. Further enhancements are suggested with adherence to\nprinciples and user centered design and developing customizable web portals\ncompatible for connections with differing speeds. A need for developing new\ndesign models for differencing user groups and implementing web accessibility\nstrategy are emphasized as vital steps towards effective information\ndissemination via e-commerce websites in the developing countries."

    "summary": "The problem of destination accessibility is a vital concern in the\nsustainable tourism development in the emerging regions due to the increasing\nnumbers of tourism business growth in the recent times. Tourism is one of the\npotential foreign exchange earning sectors, which place sustainability as one\nof the main success metrics for benchmarking the industry's overall\ndevelopment. On the other hand, there are several destinations, which are\ninaccessible to tourists due to several reasons. Underutilization of potential\ndestinations in both pre purchase and consumption stages is a strategic\ndisadvantage for emerging countries on leading their tourism industry towards\nsustainability. A virtual world model to increase the destination accessibility\nof tourism products has been proposed. The model has to be designed with visual\nand auditory experience to tourists. The model is expected to enhance the\naccessibility of destinations for users of different categories. Elderly users,\nusers with panic disorders, users with mobility impairments also will be able\nto enjoy traveling experience just same as other, through the proposed model."

Current\nmodels assume that the spatial impact area, i.e., the area in which a person\naffects a link's RSS, has constant size. This paper shows that the spatial\nimpact area varies considerably for each link. Data from extensive experiments\nare used to derive a multi-scale spatial weight model that is a function of the\nfade level, i.e., the difference between the predicted and measured RSS, and of\nthe direction of RSS change. In addition, a measurement model is proposed which\ngives a probability of a person locating inside the derived spatial model for\neach given RSS measurement. A real-time radio tomographic imaging system is\ndescribed which uses channel diversity and the presented models. Experiments in\nan open indoor environment, in a typical one-bedroom apartment and in a\nthrough-wall scenario are conducted to determine the accuracy of the system. We\ndemonstrate that the new system is capable of localizing and tracking a person\nwith high accuracy (<0.30 m) in all the environments, without the need to\nchange the model parameters."

Additionally, our approach\nallows for automatic translation into the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which\nenables automatic reasoning over the wiki content. The developed wiki\nenvironment thus allows users to build, query and view OWL knowledge bases via\na user-friendly multilingual natural language interface. As a further feature,\nthe underlying multilingual grammar is integrated into the wiki and can be\ncollaboratively edited to extend the vocabulary of the wiki or even customize\nits sentence structures. This work demonstrates the combination of the existing\ntechnologies of Attempto Controlled English and Grammatical Framework, and is\nimplemented as an extension of the existing semantic wiki engine AceWiki."

Affective multimedia databases are simple repositories of multimedia\ndocuments with annotated high-level semantics and affective content. Although\nimportant all affective multimedia databases have numerous deficiencies which\nimpair their applicability. To establish a better understanding of how experts\nuse affective multimedia databases an online survey was conducted into the\nsubject. The survey results are statistically significant and indicate that\ncontemporary databases lack stimuli with rich semantic and emotional content.\n73.33% of survey participants find the databases lacking at least some\nimportant semantic or emotion content. Most of the participants consider\nstimuli descriptions to be inadequate. Overall, 1-2h or more than 24h are\ngenerally needed to construct a single stimulation sequence. Almost 84% of the\nsurvey participants would like to use real-life videos in their research.\nExperts unequivocally recognize the need for an intelligent stimuli retrieval\napplication that would assist them in experimentation. Almost all experts agree\nsuch applications could be useful in their work."

    "summary": "We propose a new action and gesture recognition method based on\nspatio-temporal covariance descriptors and a weighted Riemannian locality\npreserving projection approach that takes into account the curved space formed\nby the descriptors. The weighted projection is then exploited during boosting\nto create a final multiclass classification algorithm that employs the most\nuseful spatio-temporal regions. We also show how the descriptors can be\ncomputed quickly through the use of integral video representations. Experiments\non the UCF sport, CK+ facial expression and Cambridge hand gesture datasets\nindicate superior performance of the proposed method compared to several recent\nstate-of-the-art techniques. The proposed method is robust and does not require\nadditional processing of the videos, such as foreground detection,\ninterest-point detection or tracking."

The two\nexperiments reported here test the impact of different event outcomes\n(Outcome-Type) and task demands (Task) on ratings of surprise for simple story\nscenarios. For the Outcome-Type variable, participants saw outcomes that were\neither known or less-known surprising outcomes for each scenario. For the Task\nvariable, participants either answered comprehension questions or provided an\nexplanation of the outcome. Outcome-Type reliably affected surprise judgments;\nknown outcomes were rated as less surprising than less-known outcomes. Task\nalso reliably affected surprise judgments; when people provided an explanation\nit lowered surprise judgments relative to simply answering comprehension\nquestions. Both experiments thus provide evidence on this less-explored\nexplanation aspect of surprise, specifically showing that ease of explanation\nis a key factor in determining the level of surprise experienced."

In this paper, we probe for such after-effects using a\nvisual search task, performed after a task in which pictures of real-world\nobjects were compared. So, target objects were first presented in a comparison\ntask (e.g., rate the similarity of this object to another) thus, presumably,\nmodifying some of their features before asking people to visually search for\nthe same object in complex scenes (with distractors and camouflaged\nbackgrounds). As visual search is known to be influenced by the features of\ntarget objects, then any after-effects of the comparison task should be\nrevealed in subsequent visual searches. Results showed that when people\npreviously rated an object as being high on a scale (e.g., colour similarity or\ngeneral similarity) then visual search is inhibited (slower RTs and more\nsaccades in eye-tracking) relative to an object being rated as low in the same\nscale. There was also some evidence that different comparison tasks (e.g.,\ncompare on colour or compare on general similarity) have differential effects\non visual search."

Classic\nauditory BCIs rely on spatially static stimuli, which are often boring and\ndifficult to perceive when subjects have non-uniform spatial hearing perception\ncharacteristics. The concept of moving sound proposed and tested in the paper\nallows for the creation of a P300 oddball paradigm of necessary target and\nnon-target auditory stimuli, which are more interesting and easier to\ndistinguish. We present a report of our study of seven healthy subjects, which\nproves the concept of moving sound stimuli usability for a novel BCI. We\ncompare online BCI classification results in static and moving sound paradigms\nyielding similar accuracy results. The subject preference reports suggest that\nthe proposed moving sound protocol is more comfortable and easier to\ndiscriminate with the online BCI."

An important factor in the development of\nsuch systems is the overhead in time, cost and human resources to manually\ncreate the content for these scenarios. We focus on how to create content for\nscenarios in medical, military, commerce and gaming applications where\nmaintaining the integrity and coherence of the content is integral for the\nsystem's success. To do so, we present an automatic method for generating\ncontent about everyday activities through combining computer science techniques\nwith the crowd. We use the crowd in three basic ways: to capture a database of\nscenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements\nfor specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting\nscenarios. We found that the generated scenarios were rated as reliable and\nconsistent by the crowd when compared to the scenarios that were originally\ncaptured. We also compared the generated scenarios to those created by\ntraditional planning techniques. We found that both methods were equally\neffective in generated reliable and consistent scenarios, yet the main\nadvantages of our approach is that the content we generate is more varied and\nmuch easier to create. We have begun integrating this approach within a\nscenario-based training application for novice investigators within the law\nenforcement departments to improve their questioning skills."

It provides useful\ninformation to optimize website design, Web browser design, search engines\nofferings, and online advertisement. We argue that new technologies and new\nservices continue to have significant effects on the way how people browse the\nWeb. For example, listening to music clips on YouTube or to a radio station on\nLast.fm does not require users to sit in front of their computer. Social media\nand networking sites like Facebook or micro-blogging sites like Twitter have\nattracted new types of users that previously were less inclined to go online.\nThese changes in how people browse the Web feature new characteristics which\nare not well understood so far. In this paper, we provide novel and unique\ninsights by presenting first results of DOBBS, our long-term effort to create a\ncomprehensive and representative dataset capturing online user behavior. We\nfirstly investigate the concepts of parallel browsing and passive browsing,\nshowing that browsing the Web is no longer a dedicated task for many users.\nBased on these results, we then analyze their impact on the calculation of a\nuser's dwell time -- i.e., the time the user spends on a webpage -- which has\nbecome an important metric to quantify the popularity of websites."

    "summary": "Nosocomial infections place a substantial burden on health care systems and\nrepresent a major issue in current public health, requiring notable efforts for\nits prevention. Understanding the dynamics of infection transmission in a\nhospital setting is essential for tailoring interventions and predicting the\nspread among individuals. Mathematical models need to be informed with accurate\ndata on contacts among individuals. We used wearable active Radio-Frequency\nIdentification Devices to detect face-to-face contacts among individuals with a\nspatial resolution of about 1.5 meters, and a time resolution of 20 seconds.\nThe study was conducted in a general pediatrics hospital ward, during a\none-week period, and included 119 participants. Nearly 16,000 contacts were\nrecorded during the study, with a median of approximately 20 contacts per\nparticipants per day. Overall, 25% of the contacts involved a ward assistant,\n23% a nurse, 22% a patient, 22% a caregiver, and 8% a physician. The majority\nof contacts were of brief duration, but long and frequent contacts especially\nbetween patients and caregivers were also found. In the setting under study,\ncaregivers do not represent a significant potential for infection spread to a\nlarge number of individuals, as their interactions mainly involve the\ncorresponding patient. Nurses would deserve priority in prevention strategies\ndue to their central role in the potential propagation paths of infections. Our\nstudy shows the feasibility of accurate and reproducible measures of the\npattern of contacts in a hospital setting. The results are particularly useful\nfor the study of the spread of respiratory infections, for monitoring critical\npatterns, and for setting up tailored prevention strategies. Proximity-sensing\ntechnology should be considered as a valuable tool for measuring such patterns\nand evaluating nosocomial prevention strategies in specific settings."

    "summary": "Mobile phones have developed into complex platforms with large numbers of\ninstalled applications and a wide range of sensitive data. Application security\npolicies limit the permissions of each installed application. As applications\nmay interact, restricting single applications may create a false sense of\nsecurity for the end users while data may still leave the mobile phone through\nother applications. Instead, the information flow needs to be policed for the\ncomposite system of applications in a transparent and usable manner. In this\npaper, we propose to employ static analysis based on the software architecture\nand focused data flow analysis to scalably detect information flows between\ncomponents. Specifically, we aim to reveal transitivity of trust problems in\nmulti-component mobile platforms. We demonstrate the feasibility of our\napproach with Android applications, although the generalization of the analysis\nto similar composition-based architectures, such as Service-oriented\nArchitecture, can also be explored in the future."

However, traditional gaze tracking hardware is expensive and\nrequires local study participants, so acquiring gaze location data from a large\nnumber of participants is very problematic. In this work we propose a\ncrowdsourced method for acquisition of gaze direction data from a virtually\nunlimited number of participants, using a robust self-reporting mechanism (see\nFigure 1). Our system collects temporally sparse but spatially dense\npoints-of-attention in any visual information. We apply our approach to an\nexisting video data set and demonstrate that we obtain results similar to\ntraditional gaze tracking. We also explore the parameter ranges of our method,\nand collect gaze tracking data for a large set of YouTube videos."

    "summary": "One of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence is the ability to regulate\nemotions. Research suggests that cognitive reappraisal - a technique that\ninvolves reinterpreting the meaning of a thought or situation - can\ndown-regulate negative emotions, without incurring significant psychological or\nphysiological costs. Habitual use of this strategy is also linked to many key\nindices of physical and emotional health. Unfortunately, this technique is not\nalways easy to apply. Thinking flexibly about stressful thoughts and situations\nrequires creativity and poise, faculties that often elude us when we need them\nthe most. In this paper, we propose an assistive technology that coordinates\ncollective intelligence on demand, to help individuals reappraise stressful\nthoughts and situations. In two experiments, we assess key features of our\ndesign and we demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourcing empathetic\nreappraisals with on demand workforces, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk."

    "summary": "Human computation refers to the outsourcing of computation tasks to human\nworkers. It offers a new direction for solving a variety of problems and calls\nfor innovative ways of managing human computation processes. The majority of\nhuman computation tasks take a parallel approach, whereas the potential of an\niterative approach, i.e., having workers iteratively build on each other's\nwork, has not been sufficiently explored. This study investigates whether and\nhow human workers' awareness of previous workers' rationales affects the\nperformance of the iterative approach in a brainstorming task and a rating\ntask. Rather than viewing this work as a conclusive piece, the author believes\nthat this research endeavor is just the beginning of a new research focus that\nexamines and supports meta-cognitive processes in crowdsourcing activities."

    "summary": "As social Q&A sites gain popularity, it is important to understand how users\njudge the authoritativeness of users and content, build reputation, and\nidentify and promote high quality content. We conducted a study of emerging\nsocial Q&A site Quora. First, we describe user activity on Quora by analyzing\ndata across 60 question topics and 3917 users. Then we provide a rich\nunderstanding of issues of authority, reputation, and quality from in-depth\ninterviews with ten Quora users. Our results show that primary sources of\ninformation on Quora are judged authoritative. Also, users judge the reputation\nof other users based on their past contributions. Social voting helps users\nidentify and promote good content but is prone to preferential attachment.\nCombining social voting with sophisticated algorithms for ranking content might\nenable users to better judge others' reputation and promote high quality\ncontent."

We examine research related to\ncollective intelligence and differentiate work on collective creativity from\nother collective activities by analyzing systems with respect to the tasks that\nare performed and the outputs that result.

    "summary": "RxNorm was utilized as the basis for direct-capture of medication history\ndata in a live EHR system deployed in a large, multi-state outpatient\nbehavioral healthcare provider in the United States serving over 75,000\ndistinct patients each year across 130 clinical locations. This tool\nincorporated auto-complete search functionality for medications and proper\ndosage identification assistance. The overarching goal was to understand if and\nhow standardized terminologies like RxNorm can be used to support practical\ncomputing applications in live EHR systems. We describe the stages of\nimplementation, approaches used to adapt RxNorm's data structure for the\nintended EHR application, and the challenges faced. We evaluate the\nimplementation using a four-factor framework addressing flexibility, speed,\ndata integrity, and medication coverage. RxNorm proved to be functional for the\nintended application, given appropriate adaptations to address high-speed\ninput/output (I/O) requirements of a live EHR and the flexibility required for\ndata entry in multiple potential clinical scenarios. Future research around\nsearch optimization for medication entry, user profiling, and linking RxNorm to\ndrug classification schemes holds great potential for improving the user\nexperience and utility of medication data in EHRs."

However, an issue that still deserves more study concerns the automatic\nevaluation of generalised data. Indeed, many automated generalisation systems\nrequire the utilisation of an evaluation function to automatically assess\ngeneralisation outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new approach dedicated to\nthe design of such a function. This approach allows an imperfectly defined\nevaluation function to be revised through a man-machine dialogue. The user\ngives its preferences to the system by comparing generalisation outcomes.\nMachine Learning techniques are then used to improve the evaluation function.\nAn experiment carried out on buildings shows that our approach significantly\nimproves generalisation evaluation functions defined by users."
