    "summary": "This paper analyzes the distribution of cycle lengths in turbo decoding and\nlow-density parity check (LDPC) graphs. The properties of such cycles are of\nsignificant interest in the context of iterative decoding algorithms which are\nbased on belief propagation or message passing. We estimate the probability\nthat there exist no simple cycles of length less than or equal to k at a\nrandomly chosen node in a turbo decoding graph using a combination of counting\narguments and independence assumptions. For large block lengths n, this\nprobability is approximately e^{-{2^{k-1}-4}/n}, k>=4. Simulation results\nvalidate the accuracy of the various approximations. For example, for turbo\ncodes with a block length of 64000, a randomly chosen node has a less than 1%\nchance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to 10, but has a\ngreater than 99.9% chance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to\n20. The effect of the \"S-random\" permutation is also analyzed and it is shown\nthat while it eliminates short cycles of length k<8, it does not significantly\naffect the overall distribution of cycle lengths. Similar analyses and\nsimulations are also presented for graphs for LDPC codes. The paper concludes\nby commenting briefly on how these results may provide insight into the\npractical success of iterative decoding methods."

The results of these evaluations\nare used to determine both the uncertainty in model predictions and the input\nvariables that drive this uncertainty. This methodology is essential in\nsituations where a decision has to be taken based on the model results; typical\nexamples include risk and emergency management systems, financial analysis and\nmany others. It is also highly recommended as part of model validation, even\nwhere the models are used for diagnostic purposes, as an element of sound model\nbuilding. SimLab allows an exploration of the space of possible alternative\nmodel assumptions and structure on the prediction of the model, thereby testing\nboth the quality of the model and the robustness of the model based inference."

In fact,\nthere are two modifications of that problem, namely the finite (the existence\nof a finite realization is required) and infinite one (the realization is\nrequired to be infinite). In this paper we show that GNP and its modifications\nfor all finite classes H of finite graphs are reduced to the same problems with\nan additional restriction on H.

    "summary": "A coloring of a complete bipartite graph is shuffle-preserved if it is the\ncase that assigning a color $c$ to edges $(u, v)$ and $(u', v')$ enforces the\nsame color assignment for edges $(u, v')$ and $(u',v)$. (In words, the induced\nsubgraph with respect to color $c$ is complete.) In this paper, we investigate\na variant of the Ramsey problem for the class of complete bipartite\nmultigraphs. (By a multigraph we mean a graph in which multiple edges, but no\nloops, are allowed.) Unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in Ramsey theory\nwhich imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in\na graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only\nrequires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s\nincident edges is bounded by $m$. Note that the number of colors found in a\ngraph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. We prove that given any $n \\times\nn$ complete bipartite multigraph $G$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local\ncoloring displays a monochromatic copy of $K_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1)\n< n$. Moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and\n$m=3\\cdot 2^{k-2}$ for every integer $k\\geq 2$. As for the lower bound of $p$,\nwe show that the existence of a monochromatic $K_{p,p}$ is not guaranteed if\n$p> \\lceil \\frac{n}{m} \\rceil$. Finally, we give a generalization for\n$k$-partite graphs and a method applicable to general graphs. Many conclusions\nfound in $m$-local coloring can be inferred to similar results of $m$-coloring."

    "summary": "The relationship between the length of a word and the maximum length of its\nunbordered factors is investigated in this paper. Consider a finite word w of\nlength n. We call a word bordered, if it has a proper prefix which is also a\nsuffix of that word. Let f(w) denote the maximum length of all unbordered\nfactors of w, and let p(w) denote the period of w. Clearly, f(w) < p(w)+1.\n  We establish that f(w) = p(w), if w has an unbordered prefix of length f(w)\nand n > 2f(w)-2. This bound is tight and solves the stronger version of a 21\nyears old conjecture by Duval. It follows from this result that, in general, n\n> 3f(w)-3 implies f(w) = p(w) which gives an improved bound for the question\nasked by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979."

    "summary": "A cycle double cover (CDC) of an undirected graph is a collection of the\ngraph's cycles such that every edge of the graph belongs to exactly two cycles.\nWe describe a constructive method for generating all the cubic graphs that have\na 6-CDC (a CDC in which every cycle has length 6). As an application of the\nmethod, we prove that all such graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle. A sense of\ndirection is an edge labeling on graphs that follows a globally consistent\nscheme and is known to considerably reduce the complexity of several\ndistributed problems. In [9], a particular instance of sense of direction,\ncalled a chordal sense of direction (CSD), is studied and the class of\nk-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal CSD) is\nanalyzed. We now show that nearly all the cubic graphs in this class have a\n6-CDC, the only exception being K4."

We define a new, and as we believe, simpler\nand more natural framework: violator spaces, which constitute a proper\ngeneralization of LP-type problems. We show that Clarkson's randomized\nalgorithms for low-dimensional linear programming work in the context of\nviolator spaces. For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm\nfor the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant\nnumber of blocks. We also give two new characterizations of LP-type problems:\nthey are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type\nproblems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets\nof a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the\nminimum of its intersection)."

    "summary": "A unit cube in $k$ dimensional space (or \\emph{$k$-cube} in short) is defined\nas the Cartesian product $R_1\\times R_2\\times...\\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for\n$1\\leq i\\leq k$) is a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real\nline. A $k$-cube representation of a graph $G$ is a mapping of the vertices of\n$G$ to $k$-cubes such that two vertices in $G$ are adjacent if and only if\ntheir corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The\n\\emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted as $\\cubi(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$\nhas a $k$-cube representation. Roberts \\cite{Roberts} showed that for any graph\n$G$ on $n$ vertices, $\\cubi(G)\\leq 2n/3$. Many NP-complete graph problems have\npolynomial time deterministic algorithms or have good approximation ratios in\ngraphs of low cubicity. In most of these algorithms, computing a low\ndimensional cube representation of the given graph is usually the first step.\n  We present an efficient algorithm to compute the $k$-cube representation of\n$G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta$ in $O(\\Delta \\ln b)$ dimensions where $b$ is\nthe bandwidth of $G$. Bandwidth of $G$ is at most $n$ and can be much lower.\nThe algorithm takes as input a bandwidth ordering of the vertices in $G$.\nThough computing the bandwidth ordering of vertices for a graph is NP-hard,\nthere are heuristics that perform very well in practice. Even theoretically,\nthere is an $O(\\log^4 n)$ approximation algorithm for computing the bandwidth\nordering of a graph using which our algorithm can produce a $k$-cube\nrepresentation of any given graph in $k=O(\\Delta(\\ln b + \\ln\\ln n))$\ndimensions. Both the bounds on cubicity are shown to be tight upto a factor of\n$O(\\log\\log n)$."

    "summary": "This paper addresses the basic question of how well can a tree approximate\ndistances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of\nconstructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in\nthe graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling\ndistortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of $\\epsilon$,\nwith the guarantee that for each $\\epsilon$ the distortion of a fraction\n$1-\\epsilon$ of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in\nparticular, that the \\emph{average distortion} and $\\ell_q$-distortions are\nsmall. Specifically, our embeddings have \\emph{constant} average distortion and\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ $\\ell_2$-distortion. This follows from the following\nresults: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling\ndistortion $O(\\sqrt{1/\\epsilon})$. For the graph setting we prove that any\nweighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion\n$O(\\sqrt{1/\\epsilon})$. These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary\ntrees.\n  For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion\nof $\\tilde{O}(\\log^2 (1/\\epsilon))$, which implies \\emph{constant}\n$\\ell_q$-distortion for every fixed $q<\\infty$."

An NDSAN consists\nbasically of a set of activities along with precedence relations involving\nthese activities, which determine their order of execution. Activity durations\nare stochastic, given by continuous, nonnegative random variables. The\nnondeterministic behavior of an NDSAN is based on two additional possibilities:\n(i) by associating choice probabilities with groups of activities, some\nbranches of execution may not be taken; (ii) by allowing iterated executions of\ngroups of activities according to predetermined probabilities, the number of\ntimes an activity must be executed is not determined a priori. These properties\nlead to a rich variety of activity networks, capable of modeling many real\nsituations in process engineering, project design, and troubleshooting. We\ndescribe a recursive simulation algorithm for NDSANs, whose repeated execution\nproduces a close approximation to the probability distribution of the\ncompletion time of the entire network.

    "summary": "This paper considers heuristics for well known resource-constrained project\nscheduling problem (RCPSP). First a feasible schedule is constructed using\nrandomized best insertion algorithm. The construction is followed by a local\nsearch where a new solution is generated as follows: first we randomly delete m\nactivities from the list, which are then reinserted in the list in consecutive\norder. At the end of run, the schedule with the minimum makespan is selected.\nExperimental work shows very good results on standard test instances found in\nPSPLIB"

    "summary": "Cellular automata are often used to model systems in physics, social\nsciences, biology that are inherently asynchronous. Over the past 20 years,\nstudies have demonstrated that the behavior of cellular automata drastically\nchanged under asynchronous updates. Still, the few mathematical analyses of\nasynchronism focus on one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, either\non single examples or on specific classes. As for other classic dynamical\nsystems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional\nsystems is a long lasting challenging problem.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D\nasynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,\nupdates to the minority state of its neighborhood. Our experiments reveal that\nin spite of its simplicity, the minority rule exhibits a quite complex response\nto asynchronism. By focusing on the fully asynchronous regime, we are however\nable to describe completely the asymptotic behavior of this dynamics as long as\nthe initial configuration satisfies some natural constraints. Besides these\ntechnical results, we have strong reasons to believe that our techniques\nrelying on defining an energy function from the transition table of the\nautomaton may be extended to the wider class of threshold automata."

One of\nthe fundamental problems in this area is bounding (asymptotically) the maximum\nlength of such sequences. Following Klazar, let Ex(\\sigma,n) be the maximum\nlength of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences\nisomorphic to \\sigma. It has been proved that for every \\sigma, Ex(\\sigma,n) is\neither linear or very close to linear; in particular it is O(n\n2^{\\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}), where \\alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O(1)\ndepends on \\sigma. However, very little is known about the properties of \\sigma\nthat induce superlinearity of \\Ex(\\sigma,n).\n  In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear\nforbidden subsequences. To be specific, we show that there are 17 prototypical\nsuperlinear forbidden subsequences, some of which can be made arbitrarily long\nthrough a simple padding operation. Perhaps the most novel part of our\nconstructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden\nsubsequences."

    "summary": "In the classical s-t network reliability problem a fixed network G is given\nincluding two designated vertices s and t (called terminals). The edges are\nsubject to independent random failure, and the task is to compute the\nprobability that s and t are connected in the resulting network, which is known\nto be #P-complete. In this paper we are interested in approximating the s-t\nreliability in case of a directed acyclic original network G. We introduce and\nanalyze a specialized version of the Monte-Carlo algorithm given by Karp and\nLuby. For the case of uniform edge failure probabilities, we give a worst-case\nbound on the number of samples that have to be drawn to obtain an epsilon-delta\napproximation, being sharper than the original upper bound. We also derive a\nvariance reduction of the estimator which reduces the expected number of\niterations to perform to achieve the desired accuracy when applied in\nconjunction with different stopping rules. Initial computational results on two\ntypes of random networks (directed acyclic Delaunay graphs and a slightly\nmodified version of a classical random graph) with up to one million vertices\nare presented. These results show the advantage of the introduced Monte-Carlo\napproach compared to direct simulation when small reliabilities have to be\nestimated and demonstrate its applicability on large-scale instances."

The best previously known bounds were within 11% and 3%\nrespectively. We then prove that the value of $u_n$ actually has the same rate\nof growth for ``almost all'' natural numbers $n$. This ``average'' growth is\ndistinct from the maximal and minimal rates and can also be expressed in terms\nof a spectral quantity (the Lyapunov exponent). We use this expression to\nestimate it.

We show that two families of such series are actually\nthe same: the unambiguous rational series on the one hand, and the max-plus and\nmin-plus rational series on the other hand. The decidability of equality was\nknown to hold in both families with different proofs, so the above unifies the\npicture. We give an effective procedure to build an unambiguous automaton from\na max-plus automaton and a min-plus one that recognize the same series."

If, moreover,\neach vertex $u \\in V(G)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \\in V(H)$, then\nthe cost of a homomorphism $f$ is $\\sum_{u\\in V(G)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For each fixed\ndigraph $H$, the minimum cost homomorphism problem for $H$, denoted\nMinHOM($H$), can be formulated as follows: Given an input digraph $G$, together\nwith costs $c_i(u)$, $u\\in V(G)$, $i\\in V(H)$, decide whether there exists a\nhomomorphism of $G$ to $H$ and, if one exists, to find one of minimum cost.\nMinimum cost homomorphism problems encompass (or are related to) many well\nstudied optimization problems such as the minimum cost chromatic partition and\nrepair analysis problems. We focus on the minimum cost homomorphism problem for\nlocally semicomplete digraphs and quasi-transitive digraphs which are two\nwell-known generalizations of tournaments.

Although this problem is strongly NP-complete on\ngeneral networks, pseudo-polynomial algorithms were found for planar networks\nwith a single source and a single sink and without the possibility to remove\nvertices. In this work we introduce pseudo-polynomial algorithms which overcome\nsome of the restrictions of previous methods. We propose a planarity-preserving\ntransformation that allows to incorporate vertex removals and vertex capacities\nin pseudo-polynomial interdiction algorithms for planar graphs. Additionally, a\npseudo-polynomial algorithm is introduced for the problem of determining the\nminimal interdiction budget which is at least needed to make it impossible to\nsatisfy the demand of all sink nodes, on planar networks with multiple sources\nand sinks satisfying that the sum of the supplies at the source nodes equals\nthe sum of the demands at the sink nodes. Furthermore we show that the\nk-densest subgraph problem on planar graphs can be reduced to a network flow\ninterdiction problem on a planar graph with multiple sources and sinks and\npolynomially bounded input numbers.

    "summary": "We introduce a model for synchronizer of marked pairs, which is a node for\njoining results of parallel processing in two-branch fork-join queueing\nnetwork. A distribution for number of jobs in the synchronizer is obtained.\nCalculations are performed assuming that: arrivals to the network form a\nPoisson process, each branch operates like an M/M/N queueing system. It is\nshown that a mean quantity of jobs in the synchronizer is bounded below by the\nvalue, defined by parameters of the network (which contains the synchronizer)\nand does not depend upon performance and particular properties of the\nsynchronizer. A domain of network parameters is found, where the flow of jobs\ndeparting from the synchronizer does not manifest a statistically significant\ndifference from the Poisson type, despite the correlation between job flows\nfrom both branches of the fork-join network."

The synchronizing word of a deterministic automaton is\na word in the alphabet of colors (considered as letters) of its edges that maps\nthe automaton to a single state. A coloring of edges of a directed graph of\nuniform outdegree (constant outdegree of any vertex) is synchronizing if the\ncoloring turns the graph into a deterministic finite automaton possessing a\nsynchronizing word. The road coloring problem is the problem of synchronizing\ncoloring of a directed finite strongly connected graph of uniform outdegree if\nthe greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles is one. The\nproblem posed in 1970 had evoked a noticeable interest among the specialists in\nthe theory of graphs, automata, codes, symbolic dynamics as well as among the\nwide mathematical community. A polynomial time algorithm of $O(n^3)$ complexity\nin the most worst case and quadratic in majority of studied cases for the road\ncoloring of the considered graph is presented below. The work is based on\nrecent positive solution of the road coloring problem. The algorithm was\nimplemented in the package TESTAS"

The theory\nwas introduced along with the complexity classes VP and VNP which are analogues\nof the classical classes P and NP. Families of polynomials that are difficult\nto evaluate (that is, VNP-complete) includes the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials. In a previous paper the authors together with P. Koiran studied\nthe expressive power of permanent and hamiltonian polynomials of matrices of\nbounded treewidth, as well as the expressive power of perfect matchings of\nplanar graphs. It was established that the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials of matrices of bounded treewidth are equivalent to arithmetic\nformulas. Also, the sum of weights of perfect matchings of planar graphs was\nshown to be equivalent to (weakly) skew circuits. In this paper we continue the\nresearch in the direction described above, and study the expressive power of\npermanents, hamiltonians and perfect matchings of matrices that have bounded\npathwidth or bounded cliquewidth. In particular, we prove that permanents,\nhamiltonians and perfect matchings of matrices that have bounded pathwidth\nexpress exactly arithmetic formulas. This is an improvement of our previous\nresult for matrices of bounded treewidth. Also, for matrices of bounded\nweighted cliquewidth we show membership in VP for these polynomials."

The\nD0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is the sequence of words (w, f(w), f(f(w)),\nf(f(f(w))), ...). The corresponding sequence of lengths, that is the function\nmapping each non-negative integer n to |f^n(w)|, is called the growth function\nof (A, f, w). In 1978, Salomaa and Soittola deduced the following result from\ntheir thorough study of the theory of rational power series: if the\nD0L-sequence generated by (A, f, w) is not eventually the empty word then there\nexist a non-negative integer d and a real number b greater than or equal to one\nsuch that |f^n(w)| behaves like n^d b^n as n tends to infinity. The aim of the\npresent paper is to present a short, direct, elementary proof of this theorem."

The emphasis is put on the use, besides classical\ncomparative information, of information about difference of attractiveness\nbetween acts, and on the existence, for each point of view, of a ``neutral\nlevel'', allowing to introduce the absolute notion of attractive or repulsive\nact. It is shown that in this case, the Sipos integral is a suitable solution,\nalthough not unique. Properties of the Sipos integral as a new way of\naggregating criteria are shown, with emphasis on the interaction among\ncriteria."

A graph is\nstrongly chordal if it is chordal and every even cycle has a chord joining\nvertices whose distance on the cycle is odd. Farber proved that a graph is\nstrongly chordal if and only if it is chordal and contains no induced suns.\nThere are well known polynomial-time algorithms for recognizing a sun in a\nchordal graph. Recently, polynomial-time algorithms for finding a sun for a\nlarger class of graphs, the so-called HHD-free graphs, have been discovered.

More precisely,\nthe freeness problem over a semigroup S is defined as: given a finite subset X\nof S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over X. To\ndate, the decidabilities of two freeness problems have been closely examined.\nIn 1953, Sardinas and Patterson proposed a now famous algorithm for the\nfreeness problem over the free monoid. In 1991, Klarner, Birget and Satterfield\nproved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer\nmatrices. Both results led to the publication of many subsequent papers. The\naim of the present paper is three-fold: (i) to present general results\nconcerning freeness problems, (ii) to study the decidability of freeness\nproblems over various particular semigroups (special attention is devoted to\nmultiplicative matrix semigroups), and (iii) to propose precise, challenging\nopen questions in order to promote the study of the topic."

    "summary": "Erd\\\"os conjectured that if $G$ is a triangle free graph of chromatic number\nat least $k\\geq 3$, then it contains an odd cycle of length at least\n$k^{2-o(1)}$ \\cite{sudakovverstraete, verstraete}. Nothing better than a linear\nbound (\\cite{gyarfas}, Problem 5.1.55 in \\cite{West}) was so far known. We make\nprogress on this conjecture by showing that $G$ contains an odd cycle of length\nat least $O(k\\log\\log k)$. Erd\\\"os' conjecture is known to hold for graphs with\ngirth at least 5. We show that if a girth 4 graph is $C_5$ free, then Erd\\\"os'\nconjecture holds. When the number of vertices is not too large we can prove\nbetter bounds on $\\chi$. We also give bounds on the chromatic number of graphs\nwith at most $r$ cycles of length $1\\bmod k$, or at most $s$ cycles of length\n$2\\bmod k$, or no cycles of length $3\\bmod k$. Our techniques essentially\nconsist of using a depth first search tree to decompose the graph into ordered\npaths, which are then fed to an online coloring algorithm. Using this technique\nwe give simple proofs of some old results, and also obtain several simpler\nresults. We also obtain a lower bound on the number of colors an online\ncoloring algorithm needs to use on triangle free graphs."

In this pa- per we present an alternate\napproach: using the CA as a model or theory of physical systems and devices.\nWhile this approach abstracts away all details of the underlying physical\nsystem, it remains faithful to the fact that there is an underlying physical\nreality which it describes. This imposes certain restrictions on the types of\ncomputations a CA can physically carry out, and the resources it needs to do\nso.

    "summary": "Sturmian words are infinite binary words with many equivalent definitions:\nThey have a minimal factor complexity among all aperiodic sequences; they are\nbalanced sequences (the labels 0 and 1 are as evenly distributed as possible)\nand they can be constructed using a mechanical definition. All this properties\nmake them good candidates for being extremal points in scheduling problems over\ntwo processors. In this paper, we consider the problem of generalizing Sturmian\nwords to trees. The problem is to evenly distribute labels 0 and 1 over\ninfinite trees. We show that (strongly) balanced trees exist and can also be\nconstructed using a mechanical process as long as the tree is irrational. Such\ntrees also have a minimal factor complexity. Therefore they bring the hope that\nextremal scheduling properties of Sturmian words can be extended to such trees,\nas least partially.

The {\\it cubicity} of\n$G$, denoted as $cub(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is the intersection\ngraph of a collection of $k$-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be\nsolved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity.\nIn most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube\nrepresentation of the given graph.\n  It is known that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \\leq \\lfloor\\frac{2n}{3}\\rfloor$.\nRecently it has been shown that for a graph $G$, $cub(G) \\leq 4(\\Delta + 1)\\ln\nn$, where $n$ and $\\Delta$ are the number of vertices and maximum degree of\n$G$, respectively.

    "summary": "We are given a stack of pancakes of different sizes and the only allowed\noperation is to take several pancakes from top and flip them. The unburnt\nversion requires the pancakes to be sorted by their sizes at the end, while in\nthe burnt version they additionally need to be oriented burnt-side down. We\npresent an algorithm with the average number of flips, needed to sort a stack\nof n burnt pancakes, equal to 7n/4+O(1) and a randomized algorithm for the\nunburnt version with at most 17n/12+O(1) flips on average.\n  In addition, we show that in the burnt version, the average number of flips\nof any algorithm is at least n+\\Omega(n/log n) and conjecture that some\nalgorithm can reach n+\\Theta(n/log n).\n  We also slightly increase the lower bound on g(n), the minimum number of\nflips needed to sort the worst stack of n burnt pancakes. This bound, together\nwith the upper bound found by Heydari and Sudborough in 1997, gives the exact\nnumber of flips to sort the previously conjectured worst stack -I_n for n=3 mod\n4 and n>=15. Finally we present exact values of f(n) up to n=19 and of g(n) up\nto n=17 and disprove a conjecture of Cohen and Blum by showing that the burnt\nstack -I_{15} is not the worst one for n=15."

Local\nelimination algorithms for discrete optimization (DO) problems (DOPs) with\nconstraints are considered; a classification of dynamic programming\ncomputational procedures is given. We introduce Elimination Game and\nElimination tree. Application of bucket elimination algorithm from constraint\nsatisfaction (CS) to solving DOPs is done. We consider different local\nelimination schemes and related notions. Clustering that merges several\nvariables into single meta-variable defines a promising approach to solve DOPs.\nThis allows to create a quotient (condensed) graph and apply a local block\nelimination algorithm. In order to describe a block elimination process, we\nintroduce Block Elimination Game. We discuss the connection of aforementioned\nlocal elimination algorithmic schemes and a way of transforming the directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) of computational LEA procedure to the tree decomposition."

In previous works, we introduced Matrix Graph Grammars (MGGs)\nas a purely algebraic approach for the study of graph grammars and graph\ndynamics, based on the representation of graphs by means of their adjacency\nmatrices. MGGs have been succesfully applied to problems such as applicability\nof rule sequences, sequentialization and reachability, providing new analysis\ntechniques and generalizing and improving previous results.\n  Our next objective is to generalize MGGs in order to approach computational\ncomplexity theory and \"static\" properties of graphs out of the \"dynamics\" of\ncertain grammars. In the present work, we start building bridges between MGGs\nand complexity by introducing what we call \"Monotone Complex Logic\", which\nallows establishing a (bijective) link between MGGs and complex analysis. We\nuse this logic to recast the formulation and basic building blocks of MGGs as\nmore proper geometric and analytic concepts (scalar products, norms,\ndistances). MGG rules can also be interpreted - via operators - as complex\nnumbers. Interestingly, the subset they define can be characterized as the\nSierpinski gasket."

    "summary": "In the Matrix approach to graph transformation we represent simple digraphs\nand rules with Boolean matrices and vectors, and the rewriting is expressed\nusing Boolean operators only. In previous works, we developed analysis\ntechniques enabling the study of the applicability of rule sequences, their\nindependence, state reachability and the minimal graph able to fire a sequence.\n  In the present paper we improve our framework in two ways. First, we make\nexplicit (in the form of a Boolean matrix) some negative implicit information\nin rules. This matrix (called nihilation matrix) contains the elements that, if\npresent, forbid the application of the rule (i.e. potential dangling edges, or\nnewly added edges, which cannot be already present in the simple digraph).\nSecond, we introduce a novel notion of application condition, which combines\ngraph diagrams together with monadic second order logic. This allows for more\nflexibility and expressivity than previous approaches, as well as more concise\nconditions in certain cases. We demonstrate that these application conditions\ncan be embedded into rules (i.e. in the left hand side and the nihilation\nmatrix), and show that the applicability of a rule with arbitrary application\nconditions is equivalent to the applicability of a sequence of plain rules\nwithout application conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the former is\nequivalent to the analysis of the latter, showing that in our framework no\nadditional results are needed for the study of application conditions.\nMoreover, all analysis techniques of [21, 22] for the study of sequences can be\napplied to application conditions."

    "summary": "Winfree (1998) showed that discrete Sierpinski triangles can self-assemble in\nthe Tile Assembly Model. A striking molecular realization of this\nself-assembly, using DNA tiles a few nanometers long and verifying the results\nby atomic-force microscopy, was achieved by Rothemund, Papadakis, and Winfree\n(2004). Precisely speaking, the above self-assemblies tile completely\nfilled-in, two-dimensional regions of the plane, with labeled subsets of these\ntiles representing discrete Sierpinski triangles. This paper addresses the more\nchallenging problem of the strict self-assembly of discrete Sierpinski\ntriangles, i.e., the task of tiling a discrete Sierpinski triangle and nothing\nelse. We first prove that the standard discrete Sierpinski triangle cannot\nstrictly self-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model. We then define the fibered\nSierpinski triangle, a discrete Sierpinski triangle with the same fractal\ndimension as the standard one but with thin fibers that can carry data, and\nshow that the fibered Sierpinski triangle strictly self-assembles in the Tile\nAssembly Model. In contrast with the simple XOR algorithm of the earlier,\nnon-strict self-assemblies, our strict self-assembly algorithm makes extensive,\nrecursive use of optimal counters, coupled with measured delay and\ncorner-turning operations. We verify our strict self-assembly using the local\ndeterminism method of Soloveichik and Winfree (2007)."

    "summary": "Many real discrete optimization problems (DOPs) are $NP$-hard and contain a\nhuge number of variables and/or constraints that make the models intractable\nfor currently available solvers. Large DOPs can be solved due to their special\ntructure using decomposition approaches. An important example of decomposition\napproaches is tree decomposition with local decomposition algorithms using the\nspecial block matrix structure of constraints which can exploit sparsity in the\ninteraction graph of a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, discrete\noptimization problems with a tree structural graph are solved by local\ndecomposition algorithms. Local decomposition algorithms generate a family of\nrelated DO problems which have the same structure but differ in the right-hand\nsides. Due to this fact, postoptimality techniques in DO are applied."

    "summary": "For a tree Markov random field non-reconstruction is said to hold if as the\ndepth of the tree goes to infinity the information that a typical configuration\nat the leaves gives about the value at the root goes to zero. The distribution\nof the measure at the root conditioned on a typical boundary can be computed\nusing a distributional recurrence. However the exact computation is not\nfeasible because the support of the distribution grows exponentially with the\ndepth.\n  In this work, we introduce a notion of a survey of a distribution over\nprobability vectors which is a succinct representation of the true\ndistribution. We show that a survey of the distribution of the measure at the\nroot can be constructed by an efficient recursive algorithm. The key properties\nof surveys are that the size does not grow with the depth, they can be\nconstructed recursively, and they still provide a good bound for the distance\nbetween the true conditional distribution and the unconditional distribution at\nthe root. This approach applies to a large class of Markov random field models\nincluding randomly generated ones. As an application we show bounds on the\nreconstruction threshold for the Potts model on small-degree trees."

Graphs are supposed to be anonymous,\nthat is, nodes are unlabeled. However, while visiting a node, the robot has to\ndistinguish between edges incident to it. For each node v the endpoints of the\nedges incident to v are uniquely identified by different integer labels called\nport numbers. We are interested in minimisation of the length of the\nexploration period.\n  This problem is unsolvable if the local port numbers are set arbitrarily.\nHowever, surprisingly small periods can be achieved when assigning carefully\nthe local port numbers. Dobrev et al. described an algorithm for assigning port\nnumbers, and an oblivious agent (i.e. agent with no memory) using it, such that\nthe agent explores all graphs of size n within period 10n. Providing the agent\nwith a constant number of memory bits, the optimal length of the period was\npreviously proved to be no more than 3.75n (using a different assignment of the\nport numbers). In this paper, we improve both these bounds. More precisely, we\nshow a period of length at most 4 1/3 n for oblivious agents, and a period of\nlength at most 3.5n for agents with constant memory. Moreover, we give the\nfirst non-trivial lower bound, 2.8n, on the period length for the oblivious\ncase."

We show the\nexistence of a threshold effect for the phase transition associated with the\nsatisfiability of random quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. We consider\nboolean CNF formulas of the form $\\forall X \\exists Y \\varphi(X,Y)$, where $X$\nhas $m$ variables, $Y$ has $n$ variables and each clause in $\\varphi$ has one\nliteral from $X$ and two from $Y$. For such formulas, we show that the\nthreshold phenomenon is controlled by the ratio between the number of clauses\nand the number $n$ of existential variables. Then we give the exact location of\nthe associated critical ratio $c^{*}$. Indeed, we prove that $c^{*}$ is a\ndecreasing function of $ \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the limiting value of $m /\n\\log (n)$ when $n$ tends to infinity."

In particular, our\nalgorithm computes in polynomial time a $(1\\pm n^{-\\Omega(1)})$approximation of\nthe logarithm of the number of $k$-colourings of $G(n,d/n)$ for $k\\geq\n(2+\\epsilon) d$ with high probability over the graph instances.\n  Our algorithm is related to the algorithms of A. Bandyopadhyay et al. in SODA\n'06, and A. Montanari et al. in SODA '06, i.e. it uses {\\em spatial correlation\ndecay} to compute {\\em deterministically} marginals of {\\em Gibbs\ndistribution}. We develop a scheme whose accuracy depends on {\\em\nnon-reconstruction} of the colourings of $G(n,d/n)$, rather than {\\em\nuniqueness} that are required in previous works. This leaves open the\npossibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.\n  The set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: Given\n$G(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\\Lambda$ of\nthe graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\\Lambda$. Then we show that\nthe effect of this change on the marginals of Gibbs distribution, diminishes as\nwe move away from $\\Lambda$.

Specifically, we are interested in proving upper bounds on\nthe integrality gap of this LP, and studying its relation to other linear\nrelaxations. Our results are the following. Structural results: We extend the\ntechnique of uncrossing, usually applied to families of sets, to families of\npartitions. As a consequence we show that any basic feasible solution to the\npartition LP formulation has sparse support. Although the number of variables\ncould be exponential, the number of positive variables is at most the number of\nterminals. Relations with other relaxations: We show the equivalence of the\npartition LP relaxation with other known hypergraphic relaxations. We also show\nthat these hypergraphic relaxations are equivalent to the well studied\nbidirected cut relaxation, if the instance is quasibipartite. Integrality gap\nupper bounds: We show an upper bound of sqrt(3) ~ 1.729 on the integrality gap\nof these hypergraph relaxations in general graphs. In the special case of\nuniformly quasibipartite instances, we show an improved upper bound of 73/60 ~\n1.216. By our equivalence theorem, the latter result implies an improved upper\nbound for the bidirected cut relaxation as well."

Specifically, the expression for a 16-point transform is provided and\nresults of a few representative signals are provided. The inverse transform is\nthe inverse of the forward 16-point matrix. But at this time the inverse\ntransform is not identical to the forward transform and, therefore, our\nproposed number theoretic transform must be taken as a provisional result."

If $G$ is a planar graph with non-negative edge weights, such a\nbasis can be found in $O(n^2)$ time and space, where $n$ is the size of $G$. We\nshow that this is optimal if an explicit representation of the basis is\nrequired.

Note that this is faster than the\nintuitively natural $1/p$ factor increase over the run-time of approximately\n$\\log_2 n + \\ln n $ for the non-corrupted case.\n  We also provide a corresponding lower bound for the classical model. This\ndemonstrates that the quasirandom model is at least as robust as the fully\nrandom model despite the greatly reduced degree of independent randomness."

It is not a priori clear when\ntwo given graphs have a tight product (in fact, it is $NP$-hard to decide). We\ninvestigate the conditions under which this is possible. This perspective\nyields a new characterization of class-1 $(2k+1)$-regular graphs.

    "summary": "In the classical cop and robber game, two players, the cop C and the robber\nR, move alternatively along edges of a finite graph G. The cop captures the\nrobber if both players are on the same vertex at the same moment of time. A\ngraph G is called cop win if the cop always captures the robber after a finite\nnumber of steps. Nowakowski, Winkler (1983) and Quilliot (1983) characterized\nthe cop-win graphs as graphs admitting a dismantling scheme. In this paper, we\ncharacterize in a similar way the class CW(s,s') of cop-win graphs in the game\nin which the cop and the robber move at different speeds s' and s, s'<= s. We\nalso establish some connections between cop-win graphs for this game with s'<s\nand Gromov's hyperbolicity. In the particular case s'=1 and s=2, we prove that\nthe class of cop-win graphs is exactly the well-known class of dually chordal\ngraphs. We show that all classes CW(s,1), s>=3, coincide and we provide a\nstructural characterization of these graphs. We also investigate several\ndismantling schemes necessary or sufficient for the cop-win graphs in the game\nin which the robber is visible only every k moves for a fixed integer k>1. We\ncharacterize the graphs which are cop-win for any value of k. Finally, we\nconsider the game where the cop wins if he is at distance at most 1 from the\nrobber and we characterize via a specific dismantling scheme the bipartite\ngraphs where a single cop wins in this game."

The central idea is to study the\ndynamical behaviour of a cellular automaton through the conjoint action of its\nglobal rule (temporal action) and the shift map (spacial action): qualitative\nbehaviours inherited from topological dynamics (equicontinuity, sensitivity,\nexpansivity) are thus considered along arbitrary curves in space-time. The main\ncontributions of the paper concern equicontinuous dynamics which can be\nconnected to the notion of consequences of a word. We show that there is a\ncellular automaton with an equicontinuous dynamics along a parabola, but which\nis sensitive along any linear direction. We also show that real numbers that\noccur as the slope of a limit linear direction with equicontinuous dynamics in\nsome cellular automaton are exactly the computably enumerable numbers."

We determine the number\nof perfect matchings of every $FS(j,k)$. A cubic graph $G$ is said to be {\\em\n2-factor hamiltonian} if every 2-factor of $G$ is a hamiltonian cycle. We\ncharacterize the graphs $FS(j,k)$ that are 2-factor hamiltonian (note that\nFS(1,3) is the \"Triplex Graph\" of Robertson, Seymour and Thomas \\cite{RobSey}).\nA {\\em strong matching} $M$ in a graph $G$ is a matching $M$ such that there is\nno edge of $E(G)$ connecting any two edges of $M$. A cubic graph having a\nperfect matching union of two strong matchings is said to be a {\\em\\Jaev}. We\ncharacterize the graphs $FS(j,k)$ that are \\Jaesv."

    "summary": "Given a graph $G$, the longest path problem asks to compute a simple path of\n$G$ with the largest number of vertices. This problem is the most natural\noptimization version of the well known and well studied Hamiltonian path\nproblem, and thus it is NP-hard on general graphs. However, in contrast to the\nHamiltonian path problem, there are only few restricted graph families such as\ntrees and some small graph classes where polynomial algorithms for the longest\npath problem have been found. Recently it has been shown that this problem can\nbe solved in polynomial time on interval graphs by applying dynamic programming\nto a characterizing ordering of the vertices of the given graph\n\\cite{longest-int-algo}, thus answering an open question. In the present paper,\nwe provide the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on a\nmuch greater class, namely on cocomparability graphs. Our algorithm uses a\nsimilar - but essentially simpler - dynamic programming approach, which is\napplied to a Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) characterizing ordering of\nthe vertices of a cocomparability graph. Therefore, our results provide\nevidence that this general dynamic programming approach can be used in a more\ngeneral setting, leading to efficient algorithms for the longest path problem\non greater classes of graphs. LDFS has recently been introduced in\n\\cite{Corneil-LDFS08}. Since then, a similar phenomenon of extending an\nexisting interval graph algorithm to cocomparability graphs by using an LDFS\npreprocessing step has also been observed for the minimum path cover problem\n\\cite{Corneil-MPC}. Therefore, more interestingly, our results also provide\nevidence that cocomparability graphs present an interval graph structure when\nthey are considered using an LDFS ordering of their vertices, which may lead to\nother new and more efficient combinatorial algorithms."

    "summary": "We often encounter probability distributions given as unnormalized products\nof non-negative functions. The factorization structures are represented by\nhypergraphs called factor graphs. Such distributions appear in various fields,\nincluding statistics, artificial intelligence, statistical physics, error\ncorrecting codes, etc. Given such a distribution, computations of marginal\ndistributions and the normalization constant are often required. However, they\nare computationally intractable because of their computational costs. One\nsuccessful approximation method is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm.\nThe focus of this thesis is an analysis of the LBP algorithm. If the factor\ngraph is a tree, i.e. having no cycle, the algorithm gives the exact\nquantities. If the factor graph has cycles, however, the LBP algorithm does not\ngive exact results and possibly exhibits oscillatory and non-convergent\nbehaviors. The thematic question of this thesis is \"How the behaviors of the\nLBP algorithm are affected by the discrete geometry of the factor graph?\" The\nprimary contribution of this thesis is the discovery of a formula that\nestablishes the relation between the LBP, the Bethe free energy and the graph\nzeta function. This formula provides new techniques for analysis of the LBP\nalgorithm, connecting properties of the graph and of the LBP and the Bethe free\nenergy. We demonstrate applications of the techniques to several problems\nincluding (non) convexity of the Bethe free energy, the uniqueness and\nstability of the LBP fixed point. We also discuss the loop series initiated by\nChertkov and Chernyak. The loop series is a subgraph expansion of the\nnormalization constant, or partition function, and reflects the graph geometry.\nWe investigate theoretical natures of the series. Moreover, we show a partial\nconnection between the loop series and the graph zeta function."

    "summary": "In Graph Theory a number of results were devoted to studying the\ncomputational complexity of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set\ndecompositions of various kinds, first of all including its Hamiltonian\ndecompositions, as well as the number modulo 2 of, say, Hamiltonian\ncycles/paths etc. While the problems of finding a Hamiltonian decomposition and\nHamiltonian cycle are NP-complete, counting these objects modulo 2 in\npolynomial time is yet possible for certain types of regular undirected graphs.\nSome of the most known examples are the theorems about the existence of an even\nnumber of Hamiltonian decompositions in a 4-regular graph and an even number of\nsuch decompositions where two given edges e and g belong to different cycles\n(Thomason, 1978), as well as an even number of Hamiltonian cycles passing\nthrough any given edge in a regular odd-degreed graph (Smith's theorem). The\npresent article introduces a new algebraic technique which generalizes the\nnotion of counting modulo 2 via applying fields of Characteristic 2 and\ndeterminants and, for instance, allows to receive a polynomial-time formula for\nthe number modulo 2 of a 4-regular bipartite graph's Hamiltonian decompositions\nsuch that a given edge and a given path of length 2 belong to different\nHamiltonian cycles - hence refining/extending (in a computational sense)\nThomason's result for bipartite graphs. This technique also provides a\npolynomial-time calculation of the number modulo 2 of a graph's edge set\ndecompositions into simple cycles each containing at least one element of a\ngiven set of its edges what is a similar kind of extension of Thomason's\ntheorem as well."

    "summary": "The problem of estimating the proportion of satisfiable instances of a given\nCSP (constraint satisfaction problem) can be tackled through weighting. It\nconsists in putting onto each solution a non-negative real value based on its\nneighborhood in a way that the total weight is at least 1 for each satisfiable\ninstance. We define in this paper a general weighting scheme for the estimation\nof satisfiability of general CSPs. First we give some sufficient conditions for\na weighting system to be correct. Then we show that this scheme allows for an\nimprovement on the upper bound on the existence of non-trivial cores in 3-SAT\nobtained by Maneva and Sinclair (2008) to 4.419. Another more common way of\nestimating satisfiability is ordering. This consists in putting a total order\non the domain, which induces an orientation between neighboring solutions in a\nway that prevents circuits from appearing, and then counting only minimal\nelements. We compare ordering and weighting under various conditions."

    "summary": "A multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete $c$-partite graph.\nIn [L. Volkmann, A remark on cycles through an arc in strongly connected\nmultipartite tournaments, Appl. Math. Lett. 20 (2007) 1148--1150], Volkmann\nproved that a strongly connected $c$-partite tournament with $c \\ge 3$ contains\nan arc that belongs to a directed cycle of length $m$ for every $m \\in \\{3, 4,\n\\ldots, c\\}$. He also conjectured the existence of three arcs with this\nproperty. In this note, we prove the existence of two such arcs."

    "summary": "We consider the following problem: to decompose a nonnegative integer matrix\ninto a linear combination of binary matrices that respect the consecutive ones\nprop- erty. This problem occurs in the radiotherapy treatment of cancer. The\nnonnegative integer matrix corresponds to fields giving the different radiation\nbeams that a linear accelerator has to send throughout the body of a patient.\nDue to the in- homogeneous dose levels, leaves from a multi-leaf collimator are\nused between the accelerator and the body of the patient to block the\nradiations. The leaves positions can be represented by segments, that are\nbinary matrices with the consecutive ones property. The aim is to find\nefficient decompositions that simultaneously minimize the irradiation time, the\ncardinality of the decomposition and the setup-time to configure the multi-leaf\ncollimator at each step of the decomposition. We propose for this NP-hard\nmultiobjective combinatorial problem a heuristic, based on the adaptation of\nthe two-phase Pareto local search. Experiments are carried out on different\nsize instances and the results are reported."

Here in this\nwork we present analytical solution for the problem of fastest mixing Markov\nchain by means of stratification and semidefinite programming, for four\nparticular types of K-partite networks, namely Symmetric K-PPDR, Semi Symmetric\nK-PPDR, Cycle K-PPDR and Semi Cycle K-PPDR networks. Our method in this paper\nis based on convexity of fastest mixing Markov chain problem, and inductive\ncomparing of the characteristic polynomials initiated by slackness conditions\nin order to find the optimal transition probabilities. The presented results\nshows that a Symmetric K-PPDR network and its equivalent Semi Symmetric K-PPDR\nnetwork have the same SLEM despite the fact that Semi symmetric K-PPDR network\nhas less edges than its equivalent symmetric K-PPDR network and at the same\ntime symmetric K-PPDR network has better mixing rate per step than its\nequivalent semi symmetric K-PPDR network at first few iterations. The same\nresults are true for Cycle K-PPDR and Semi Cycle K-PPDR networks. Also the\nobtained optimal transition probabilities have been compared with the\ntransition probabilities obtained from Metropolis-Hasting method by comparing\nmixing time improvements numerically."

As a corollary, we get intrinsically universal CA with\nsimple limit sets or simple column factors. Hence we are able to 'hide' the\nsimulation power of any CA under simple dynamical indicators."

    "summary": "Consider a sequence of bit strings of length d, such that each string differs\nfrom the next in a constant number of bits. We call this sequence a quasi-Gray\ncode. We examine the problem of efficiently generating such codes, by\nconsidering the number of bits read and written at each generating step, the\naverage number of bits read while generating the entire code, and the number of\nstrings generated in the code. Our results give a trade-off between these\nconstraints, and present algorithms that do less work on average than previous\nresults, and that increase the number of bit strings generated."

    "summary": "A total coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices and edges such\nthat no adjacent vertices, edges, and no incident vertices and edges obtain the\nsame color. An \\emph{interval total $t$-coloring} of a graph $G$ is a total\ncoloring of $G$ with colors $1,2,\\...,t$ such that at least one vertex or edge\nof $G$ is colored by $i$, $i=1,2,\\...,t$, and the edges incident to each vertex\n$v$ together with $v$ are colored by $d_{G}(v)+1$ consecutive colors, where\n$d_{G}(v)$ is the degree of the vertex $v$ in $G$. In this paper we investigate\nsome properties of interval total colorings.

The\noptimization goal of the SALBP-2 version of the problem concerns the\nminimization of the so-called cycle time, that is, the time in which the tasks\nof each work station must be completed.\n  In this work we propose to tackle this problem with an iterative search\nmethod based on beam search. The proposed algorithm is able to obtain optimal,\nrespectively best-known, solutions in 283 out of 302 test cases. Moreover, for\n9 further test cases the algorithm is able to produce new best-known solutions.\nThese numbers indicate that the proposed iterative beam search algorithm is\ncurrently a state-of-the-art method for the SALBP-2."

    "summary": "A directed graph is called Eulerian, if it contains a tour that traverses\nevery arc in the graph exactly once. We study the problem of Eulerian extension\n(EE) where a directed multigraph G and a weight function is given and it is\nasked whether G can be made Eulerian by adding arcs whose total weight does not\nexceed a given threshold. This problem is motivated through applications in\nvehicle routing and flowshop scheduling. However, EE is NP-hard and thus we use\nthe parameterized complexity framework to analyze it. In parameterized\ncomplexity, the running time of algorithms is considered not only with respect\nto input length, but also with respect to other properties of the input -\ncalled \"parameters\". Dorn et. al. proved that EE can be solved in O(4^k n^4)\ntime, where k denotes the parameter \"number of arcs that have to be added\". In\nthis thesis, we analyze EE with respect to the (smaller) parameters \"number c\nof connected components in the input graph\" and \"sum b over indeg(v) -\noutdeg(v) for all vertices v in the input graph where this value is positive\".\nWe prove that there is an algorithm for EE whose running time is polynomial\nexcept for the term 4^(c log(bc^2)). To obtain this result, we make several\nobservations about the sets of arcs that have to be added to the input graph in\norder to make it Eulerian. We build upon these observations to restate EE in a\nmatching context. This matching formulation of EE might be an important tool to\nsolve the question of whether EE can be solved within running time whose\nsuperpolynomial part depends only on c. We also consider polynomial time\npreprocessing routines for EE and show that these routines cannot yield\ninstances whose size depends polynomially only on either of the parameters b,\nc, k unless coNP is contained in NP/poly."

This framework is based on a recursive definition that covers the\ncase of multiple embedded time elastic dimensions.

    "summary": "Sand pile models are dynamical systems emphasizing the phenomenon of Self\nOrganized Criticality (SOC). From N stacked grains, iterating evolution rules\nleads to some critical configuration where a small disturbance has deep\nconsequences on the system, involving numerous steps of grain fall. Physicists\nL. Kadanoff et al. inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior,\nextending the well known Sand Pile Model. In KSPM with parameter D we start\nfrom a pile of N stacked grains and apply the rule: D-1 grains can fall from\ncolumn i onto the D-1 adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height\nbetween columns i and i+1 is greater or equal to D. We propose an iterative\nstudy of KSPM evolution where one single grain addition is repeated on a heap\nof sand. The sequence of grain falls following a single grain addition is\ncalled an avalanche. From a certain column precisely studied for D=3, we\nprovide a plain process describing avalanches."

It uses local rules to depict grain\nmoves and iterate it until reaching a fixed configuration from which no rule\ncan be applied. The main interest of sand piles relies in their {\\em Self\nOrganized Criticality} (SOC), the property that a small perturbation | adding\nsome sand grains | on a fixed configuration has uncontrolled consequences on\nthe system, involving an arbitrary number of grain fall. Physicists L. Kadanoff\n{\\em et al} inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior, extending\nthe well known {\\em Sand Pile Model}. In KSPM($D$), we start from a pile of $N$\nstacked grains and apply the rule: $D-1$ grains can fall from column $i$ onto\nthe $D-1$ adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height between\ncolumns $i$ and $i+1$ is greater or equal to $D$. This paper develops a formal\nbackground for the study of KSPM fixed points. This background, resumed in a\nfinite state word transducer, is used to provide a plain formula for fixed\npoints of KSPM(3)."

    "summary": "A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a {\\it unipolar graph} if there exits a partition $V=V_1\n\\cup V_2$ such that, $V_1$ is a clique and $V_2$ induces the disjoint union of\ncliques. The complement-closed class of {\\it generalized split graphs} are\nthose graphs $G$ such that either $G$ {\\it or} the complement of $G$ is\nunipolar. Generalized split graphs are a large subclass of perfect graphs. In\nfact, it has been shown that almost all $C_5$-free (and hence, almost all\nperfect graphs) are generalized split graphs. In this paper we present a\nrecognition algorithm for unipolar graphs that utilizes a minimal triangulation\nof the given graph, and produces a partition when one exists. Our algorithm has\nrunning time O($nm^\\prime$), where $m^\\prime$ is the number of edges in a\nminimal triangulation of the given graph. Generalized split graphs can\nrecognized via this algorithm in O($nm' + n\\OL{m}'$) = O($n^3$) time. We give\nalgorithms on unipolar graphs for finding a maximum independent set and a\nminimum clique cover in O($n+m$) time and for finding a maximum clique and a\nminimum proper coloring in O($n^{2.5}/\\log n$), when a unipolar partition is\ngiven. These algorithms yield algorithms for the four optimization problems on\ngeneralized split graphs that have the same worst-case time bound. We also\nprove that the perfect code problem is NP-Complete for unipolar graphs."

For over two decades, the\nplanar emulator problem lived poorly in a shadow of Negami's conjecture--which\nis still open--as the two were considered equivalent. But, in the end of 2008,\na surprising construction by Rieck and Yamashita falsified the natural \"planar\nemulator conjecture\", and thus opened a whole new research field. We present\nfurther results and constructions which show how far the planar-emulability\nconcept is from planar-coverability, and that the traditional idea of likening\nit to projective embeddability is actually very out-of-place.

Given an\ninfinite partial word w, the number of distinct full words over the alphabet\nthat are compatible with factors of w of length n, called subwords of w, refers\nto a measure of complexity of infinite partial words so-called subword\ncomplexity. This measure is of particular interest because we can construct\npartial words with subword complexities not achievable by full words. In this\npaper, we consider the notion of recurrence over infinite partial words, that\nis, we study whether all of the finite subwords of a given infinite partial\nword appear infinitely often, and we establish connections between subword\ncomplexity and recurrence in this more general framework."

    "summary": "An acyclic USO on a hypercube is formed by directing its edges in such as way\nthat the digraph is acyclic and each face of the hypercube has a unique sink\nand a unique source. A path to the global sink of an acyclic USO can be modeled\nas pivoting in a unit hypercube of the same dimension with an abstract\nobjective function, and vice versa. In such a way, Zadeh's 'least entered rule'\nand other history based pivot rules can be applied to the problem of finding\nthe global sink of an acyclic USO. In this paper we present some theoretical\nand empirical results on the existence of acyclic USOs for which the various\nhistory based pivot rules can be made to follow a Hamiltonian path. In\nparticular, we develop an algorithm that can enumerate all such paths up to\ndimension 6 using efficient pruning techniques.

Indeed, many of them rather follow from chains of\ntheoretical inferences that are only based on the precise model definitions and\nrely strongly, in addition, on some consequential working hypotheses. Thus, it\nis important to address the question of which features of a model effectively\ncarry some modelling meaning and which only result from the task of formalising\nobservations of reality into a mathematical language. In this article, we\naddress this question with a theoretical point view that sets our discussion\nstrictly between the two stages of the modelling process that require knowledge\nof real systems, that is, between the initial stage that chooses a global\ntheoretical framework to build the model and the final stage that exploits its\nformal predictions by comparing them to the reality that the model was designed\nto simulate. Taking Boolean automata networks as instances of models of systems\nobserved in reality, we analyse in this setting the remaining stages of the\nmodelling process and we show how the meaning of theoretical concepts can\nsubtly rely on formal choices such as definitions and hypotheses."

That leads to two new upper bounds on the transient of a linear\nmax-plus system which both improve on the bounds previously given by Even and\nRajsbaum (STOC 1990, Theory of Computing Systems 1997), by Bouillard and Gaujal\n(Research Report 2000), and by Soto y Koelemeijer (PhD Thesis 2003), and are,\nin general, incomparable with Hartmann and Arguelles' bound (Mathematics of\nOperations Research 1999). With our approach, we also show how to improve the\nlatter bound by a factor of two.\n  A significant benefit of our bounds is that each of them turns out to be\nlinear in the size of the system in various classes of linear max-plus system\nwhereas the bounds previously given are all at least quadratic. Our second\nresult concerns the relationship between matrix and system transients: We prove\nthat the transient of an NxN matrix A is, up to some constant, equal to the\ntransient of an A-linear system with an initial vector whose norm is quadratic\nin N.

    "summary": "A floorplan is a rectangular dissection which describes the relative\nplacement of electronic modules on the chip. It is called a mosaic floorplan if\nthere are no empty rooms or cross junctions in the rectangular dissection. We\nstudy a subclass of mosaic floorplans called hierarchical floorplans of order\n$k$ (abbreviated HFO-${k}$). A floorplan is HFO-$k$ if it can be obtained by\nstarting with a single rectangle and recursively embedding mosaic floorplans of\nat most $k$ rooms inside the rooms of intermediate floorplans. When $k=2$ this\nis exactly the class of slicing floorplans as the only distinct floorplans with\ntwo rooms are a room with a vertical slice and a room with a horizontal slice\nrespectdeively. And embedding such a room is equivalent to slicing the parent\nroom vertically/horizontally. In this paper we characterize permutations\ncorresponding to the Abe-labeling of HFO-$k$ floorplans and also give an\nalgorithm for identification of such permutations in linear time for any\nparticular $k$. We give a recurrence relation for exact number of HFO-5\nfloorplans with $n$ rooms which can be easily extended to any $k$ also. Based\non this recurrence we provide a polynomial time algorithm to generate the\nnumber of HFO-$k$ floorplans with $n$ rooms. Considering its application in\nVLSI design we also give moves on HFO-$k$ family of permutations for\ncombinatorial optimization using simulated annealing etc. We also explore some\ninteresting properties of Baxter permutations which have a bijective\ncorrespondence with mosaic floorplans."

As a result, we establish a\nformulation that solves Tantrix of moderate sizes, and even when the solutions\nare invalid only by elementary constraints, we achieved it by introducing\nadditional constraints and an artificial objective function to avoid flaws in\ninvalid solutions. By this approach we are successful in solving Tantrix of\nsize up to 50."

Suppose we are given a target set\n$S\\subseteq V(G)$. The paper considers the following repetitive process on $G$.\nAt time step 0 the vertices of $S$ are colored black and the other vertices are\ncolored white. After that, at each time step $t>0$, the colors of white\nvertices (if any) are updated according to the following rule. All white\nvertices $v$ that have at least $\\theta(v)$ black neighbors at the time step\n$t-1$ are colored black, and the colors of the other vertices do not change.\nThe process runs until no more white vertices can update colors from white to\nblack. The following optimization problem is called Target Set Selection:\nFinding a target set $S$ of smallest possible size such that all vertices in\n$G$ are black at the end of the process. Such an $S$ is called an {\\em optimal\ntarget set} for $G$ under the threshold function $\\theta$. We are interested in\nfinding an optimal target set for the well-known class of honeycomb networks\nunder an important threshold function called {\\em strict majority threshold},\nwhere $\\theta(v)=\\lceil (d_G(v)+1)/2\\rceil$ for each vertex $v$ in $G$. In a\ngraph $G$, a {\\em feedback vertex set} is a subset $S\\subseteq V(G)$ such that\nthe subgraph induced by $V(G)\\setminus S$ is cycle-free. In this paper we give\nexact value on the size of the optimal target set for various kinds of\nhoneycomb networks under strict majority threshold, and as a by-product we also\nprovide a minimum feedback vertex set for different kinds regular graphs in the\nclass of honeycomb networks"

The average left degree $\\Delta$ is fixed, $\\Delta \\geq 2$. We ask\nwhether for the probability that $G$ has a left-perfect matching it is\nadvantageous not to fix $d_x$ for each left node $x$ but rather choose it at\nrandom according to some (cleverly chosen) distribution. We show the following,\nprovided that the degrees of the left nodes are independent: If $\\Delta$ is an\ninteger then it is optimal to use a fixed degree of $\\Delta$ for all left\nnodes. If $\\Delta$ is non-integral then an optimal degree-distribution has the\nproperty that each left node $x$ has two possible degrees, $\\floor{\\Delta}$ and\n$\\ceil{\\Delta}$, with probability $p_x$ and $1-p_x$, respectively, where $p_x$\nis from the closed interval $[0,1]$ and the average over all $p_x$ equals\n$\\ceil{\\Delta}-\\Delta$. Furthermore, if $n=c\\cdot m$ and $\\Delta>2$ is\nconstant, then each distribution of the left degrees that meets the conditions\nabove determines the same threshold $c^*(\\Delta)$ that has the following\nproperty as $n$ goes to infinity: If $c<c^*(\\Delta)$ then there exists a\nleft-perfect matching with high probability. If $c>c^*(\\Delta)$ then there\nexists no left-perfect matching with high probability.

As it is thought by scientists a highly hard problem,\nresolving it successfully not only can improve the research in many relating\nfields, but also be meaningful to the method study. By deep analyzing the 3x+1\ncalculation process with the input positive integer becoming greater, we find a\nuseful way for solving this problem with high probability. By making use of the\ngreater calculating ability of great computers and the internet, our way is a\nvalid and powerful way for utterly solving the 3x+1 problem. This way can be\nexpressed in three points: 1) If we can find a positive integer N, for any\npositive integer less than 2N, the times of dividing 2 out of its stopping time\nis less than or equal to N, then the 3x+1 conjecture is true; 2) This N may be\nbig, so the calculation may be too big. Our way for solving this is: to find a\npositive integer K, for all positive integers less than 2K, not all the times\nof dividing 2 out of their stopping time for these integers are less than or\nequal to K, some part of these are greater than K, but the number of this part\nbecomes less and less with the K increasing; 3) This K and the calculation may\nalso be too big, our way for solving this is: to find a positive integer R, for\nall positive integers less than 2R, as above, out of their stopping time, the\ntimes of dividing 2 of some part of these integers are greater than R, also the\nnumber of this part integers does not become less immediately with the R\nincreasing, but the increasing rate of this number is less and less until to\nbelow zero."

With respect to\nan initial distribution of letters on the DNA alphabet, Behrens and Vingron\nconsider a random sequence of length $n$ that does not contain a given $k$-mer\nor word of size $k$. Under an evolution model of the DNA, they compute the\nprobability $\\mathfrak{p}_n$ that this $k$-mer appears after a unit time of 20\nyears. They prove that the waiting time for the first apparition of the $k$-mer\nis well approximated by $T_n=1/\\mathfrak{p}_n$. Their work relies on the\nsimplifying assumption that the $k$-mer is not self-overlapping. They observe\nin particular that the waiting time is mostly driven by the initial\ndistribution of letters.\n  Behrens et al. use an approach by automata that relaxes the assumption\nrelated to words overlaps. Their numerical evaluations confirms the validity of\nBehrens and Vingron approach for non self-overlapping words, but provides up to\n44% corrections for highly self-overlapping words such as $\\mathtt{AAAAA}$. We\ndevised an approach of the problem by clump analysis and generating functions;\nthis approach leads to prove a quasi-linear behaviour of $\\mathfrak{p}_n$ for a\nlarge range of values of $n$, an important result for DNA evolution.

All quadrangulations can\nbe generated by a sequence of graph operations called vertex splitting,\nstarting from the path P_2 of length 2. We define the degree D of a splitting S\nand consider restricted splittings S_{i,j} with i <= D <= j. It is known that\nS_{2,3} generate all simple quadrangulations.\n  Here we investigate the cases S_{1,2}, S_{1,3}, S_{1,1}, S_{2,2}, S_{3,3}.\nFirst we show that the splittings S_{1,2} are exactly the monotone ones in the\nsense that the resulting graph contains the original as a subgraph. Then we\nshow that they define a set of nontrivial ancestors beyond P_2 and each\nquadrangulation has a unique ancestor.\n  Our results have a direct geometric interpretation in the context of\nmechanical equilibria of convex bodies. The topology of the equilibria\ncorresponds to a 2-coloured quadrangulation with independent set sizes s, u.\nThe numbers s, u identify the primary equilibrium class associated with the\nbody by V\\'arkonyi and Domokos. We show that both S_{1,1} and S_{2,2} generate\nall primary classes from a finite set of ancestors which is closely related to\ntheir geometric results.\n  If, beyond s and u, the full topology of the quadrangulation is considered,\nwe arrive at the more refined secondary equilibrium classes. As Domokos,\nL\\'angi and Szab\\'o showed recently, one can create the geometric counterparts\nof unrestricted splittings to generate all secondary classes. Our results show\nthat S_{1,2} can only generate a limited range of secondary classes from the\nsame ancestor. The geometric interpretation of the additional ancestors defined\nby monotone splittings shows that minimal polyhedra play a key role in this\nprocess.

    "summary": "The flooding games, which are called Flood-It, Mad Virus, or HoneyBee, are a\nkind of coloring games and they have been becoming popular online. In these\ngames, each player colors one specified cell in his/her turn, and all connected\nneighbor cells of the same color are also colored by the color. This flooding\nor coloring spreads on the same color cells. It is natural to consider these\nnew coloring games on more general boards, or general graphs. Recently,\ncomputational complexities of the variants of the flooding games on several\ngraph classes have been studied. In this paper, we investigate the flooding\ngames on some graph classes characterized by interval representations. Our\nresults state that the number of colors is a key parameter to determine the\ncomputational complexity of the flooding games. When the number of colors is a\nfixed constant, these games can be solved in polynomial time on an interval\ngraph. On the other hand, if the number of colors is not bounded, the flooding\ngame is NP-complete on a proper interval graph. We also state similar results\nfor split graphs."

Being one of the most investigated and most important problems on\ngraphs, it is well known to be NP-complete and hard to approximate. The\ncomplexity of MWIS is open for hole-free graphs (i.e., graphs without induced\nsubgraphs isomorphic to a chordless cycle of length at least five). By applying\nclique separator decomposition as well as modular decomposition, we obtain\npolynomial time solutions of MWIS for odd-hole- and dart-free graphs as well as\nfor odd-hole- and bull-free graphs (dart and bull have five vertices, say\n$a,b,c,d,e$, and dart has edges $ab,ac,ad,bd,cd,de$, while bull has edges\n$ab,bc,cd,be,ce$). If the graphs are hole-free instead of odd-hole-free then\nstronger structural results and better time bounds are obtained."

    "summary": "Deciding whether a collection of unrooted trees is compatible is a\nfundamental problem in phylogenetics. Two different graph-theoretic\ncharacterizations of tree compatibility have recently been proposed. In one of\nthese, tree compatibility is characterized in terms of the existence of a\nspecific kind of triangulation in a structure known as the display graph. An\nalternative characterization expresses the tree compatibility problem as a\nchordal graph sandwich problem in a structure known as the edge label\nintersection graph. In this paper we show that the characterization using edge\nlabel intersection graphs transforms to a characterization in terms of minimal\ncuts of the display graph. We show how these two characterizations are related\nto compatibility of splits. We also show how the characterization in terms of\nminimal cuts of display graph is related to the characterization in terms of\ntriangulation of the display graph."

A star\n(biclique) k-coloring of G is a k-coloring of G that contains no monochromatic\nmaximal stars (bicliques). Similarly, for a list assignment L of G, a star\n(biclique) L-coloring is an L-coloring of G in which no maximal star (biclique)\nis monochromatic. If G admits a star (biclique) L-coloring for every k-list\nassignment L, then G is said to be star (biclique) k-choosable. In this article\nwe study the computational complexity of the star and biclique coloring and\nchoosability problems. Specifically, we prove that the star (biclique)\nk-coloring and k-choosability problems are \\Sigma_2^p-complete and\n\\Pi_3^p-complete for k > 2, respectively, even when the input graph contains no\ninduced C_4 or K_{k+2}.

In an allocation problem, edges of a\nbipartite graph have capacities and vertices have quotas to fill. Here we\ninvestigate the case of uncoordinated processes in stable allocation instances.\nIn this setting, a feasible allocation is given and the aim is to reach a\nstable allocation by raising the value of the allocation along blocking edges\nand reducing it on worse edges if needed. Do such myopic changes lead to a\nstable solution?\n  In our present work, we analyze both better and best response dynamics from\nan algorithmic point of view. With the help of two deterministic algorithms we\nshow that random procedures reach a stable solution with probability one for\nall rational input data in both cases. Surprisingly, while there is a\npolynomial path to stability when better response strategies are played (even\nfor irrational input data), the more intuitive best response steps may require\nexponential time. We also study the special case of correlated markets. There,\nrandom best response strategies lead to a stable allocation in expected\npolynomial time."

A popular implementation of the method is\nbased on solving an eigenvalue problem for M - the matrix of pairwise\ncomparisons. This does not take into account the actual values of preference.\nThe Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) approach is a modification of this method\nin which allows modelling of the reference values. To determine the relative\norder of preferences is to solve a certain linear equation system defined by\nthe matrix A and the constant term vector b (both derived from M). The article\nexplores the properties of these equation systems. In particular, it is proven\nthat for some small data inconsistency the A matrix is an M-matrix, hence the\nequation proposed by the HRE approach has a unique strictly positive solution."

    "summary": "The cops-and-robber (CR) game has been used in mobile robotics as a\ndiscretized model (played on a graph G) of pursuit/evasion problems. The\n\"classic\" CR version is a perfect information game: the cops' (pursuer's)\nlocation is always known to the robber (evader) and vice versa. Many variants\nof the classic game can be defined: the robber can be invisible and also the\nrobber can be either adversarial (tries to avoid capture) or drunk (performs a\nrandom walk). Furthermore, the cops and robber can reside in either nodes or\nedges of G. Several of these variants are relevant as models or robotic pursuit\n/ evasion. In this paper, we first define carefully several of the variants\nmentioned above and related quantities such as the cop number and the capture\ntime. Then we introduce and study the cost of visibility (COV), a quantitative\nmeasure of the increase in difficulty (from the cops' point of view) when the\nrobber is invisible. In addition to our theoretical results, we present\nalgorithms which can be used to compute capture times and COV of graphs which\nare analytically intractable. Finally, we present the results of applying these\nalgorithms to the numerical computation of COV."

    "summary": "Heuristic Rating Estimation (HRE) is a newly proposed method supporting\ndecisions analysis based on the use of pairwise comparisons. It allows that the\nranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) are\ninitially known, whilst the ranks for the other concepts have yet to be\nestimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of\nevery single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of\npriorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has\nadmissible solution if the inconsistency of pairwise comparisons is not too\nhigh. The proposed approach adopts the heuristics according to which to\ndetermine the missing priorities a weighted geometric mean is used. In this\napproach, despite an increased complexity, the solution always exists and their\nexistence does not depend on the inconsistency of the input matrix. Thus, the\npresented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than\nthe previous method. The formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics\nis accompanied by two numerical examples."

    "summary": "This article presents a new approach to the real-time solution of inverse\nproblems on embedded systems. The class of problems addressed corresponds to\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) with generalized linear constraints,\nwhereby the data from an array of sensors forms the forcing function. The\nsolution of the equation is formulated as a least squares (LS) problem with\nlinear constraints. The LS approach makes the method suitable for the explicit\nsolution of inverse problems where the forcing function is perturbed by noise.\nThe algebraic computation is partitioned into a initial preparatory step, which\nprecomputes the matrices required for the run-time computation; and the cyclic\nrun-time computation, which is repeated with each acquisition of sensor data.\nThe cyclic computation consists of a single matrix-vector multiplication, in\nthis manner computation complexity is known a-priori, fulfilling the definition\nof a real-time computation. Numerical testing of the new method is presented on\nperturbed as well as unperturbed problems; the results are compared with known\nanalytic solutions and solutions acquired from state-of-the-art implicit\nsolvers. The solution is implemented with model based design and uses only\nfundamental linear algebra; consequently, this approach supports automatic code\ngeneration for deployment on embedded systems. The targeting concept was tested\nvia software- and processor-in-the-loop verification on two systems with\ndifferent processor architectures. Finally, the method was tested on a\nlaboratory prototype with real measurement data for the monitoring of flexible\nstructures. The problem solved is: the real-time overconstrained reconstruction\nof a curve from measured gradients. Such systems are commonly encountered in\nthe monitoring of structures and/or ground subsidence."

A basic question here is whether the root's assignment affects\nthe distribution of the colourings at the vertices at distance h from the root.\nThis is the so-called \"reconstruction problem\". For a d-ary tree it is well\nknown that d/ln (d) is the reconstruction threshold. That is, for\nk=(1+eps)d/ln(d) we have non-reconstruction while for k=(1-eps)d/ln(d) we have.\n  Here, we consider the largely unstudied case where the underlying tree is\nchosen according to a predefined distribution. In particular, our focus is on\nthe well-known Galton-Watson trees. This model arises naturally in many\ncontexts, e.g. the theory of spin-glasses and its applications on random\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (rCSP). The aforementioned study focuses on\nGalton-Watson trees with offspring distribution B(n,d/n), i.e. the binomial\nwith parameters n and d/n, where d is fixed. Here we consider a broader version\nof the problem, as we assume general offspring distribution, which includes\nB(n,d/n) as a special case.\n  Our approach relates the corresponding bounds for (non)reconstruction to\ncertain concentration properties of the offspring distribution. This allows to\nderive reconstruction thresholds for a very wide family of offspring\ndistributions, which includes B(n,d/n). A very interesting corollary is that\nfor distributions with expected offspring d, we get reconstruction threshold\nd/ln(d) under weaker concentration conditions than what we have in B(n,d/n).\n  Furthermore, our reconstruction threshold for the random colorings of\nGalton-Watson with offspring B(n,d/n), implies the reconstruction threshold for\nthe random colourings of G(n,d/n)."

In the first part of our work\nwe strengthen the edge relation so that the resulting set of graphs we obtain\nare subgraphs of Gao's graphs, all of which must be \\emph{regular}.\n  In the second part of our work we strengthen the regularity condition of\nthese graphs. This is accomplished by finding a parallel between their\nalgorithms and the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for solving the\nGraph Isomorphism problem. We observe that the general principle behind their\nalgorithms is to separate the roots by computing the $1$-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman approximation to the orbits of this graph. This leads us to\nthe natural question of whether this approximation may be improved. We then go\non to show how to implicitly compute the $2$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman\napproximation of the orbits of these graphs. The polynomials that our algorithm\nfails to factor form graphs that are \\emph{strongly regular} and their set of\nadjacency matrices forms a combinatorial structure called an \\emph{Association\nscheme}."

    "summary": "A perfect matching in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of vertex\ndisjoint edges from $E$ that include all vertices in $V$. The perfect matching\nproblem is to decide if $G$ has such a matching. Recently Rothvo{\\ss} proved\nthe striking result that the Edmonds' matching polytope has exponential\nextension complexity. Here for each $n=|V|$ we describe a perfect matching\npolytope that is different from Edmonds' polytope and define a weaker notion of\nextended formulation. We show that the new polytope has a weak extended\nformulation (WEF) $Q$ of polynomial size. For each graph $G$ with $n$ vertices\nwe can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting\nlinear program over $Q$ decides whether or not $G$ has a perfect matching. The\nconstruction is uniform in the sense that, for each $n$, a single polytope is\ndefined for the class of all graphs with $n$ nodes. The method extends to solve\npoly time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem. In this\ncase a logarithmic (in the weight of the optimum solution) number of\noptimizations are made over the constructed WEF.\n  The method described in the paper involves construction of a compiler that\nconverts an algorithm given in a prescribed pseudocode into a polytope. It can\ntherefore be used to construct a polytope for any decision problem in {\\bf P}\nwhich can be solved by a given algorithm. Compared with earlier results of\nDobkin-Lipton-Reiss and Valiant our method allows the construction of explicit\nlinear programs directly from algorithms written for a standard register model,\nwithout intermediate transformations. We apply our results to obtain polynomial\nupper bounds on the non-negative rank of certain slack matrices related to\nmembership testing of languages in {\\bf P/Poly}."

    "summary": "Different graph generalizations have been recently used in an ad-hoc manner\nto represent multilayer networks, i.e. systems formed by distinct layers where\neach layer can be seen as a network. Similar constructions have also been used\nto represent time-varying networks. We introduce the concept of MultiAspect\nGraph (MAG) as a graph generalization that we prove to be isomorphic to a\ndirected graph, and also capable of representing all previous generalizations.\nIn our proposal, the set of vertices, layers, time instants, or any other\nindependent features are considered as an aspect of the MAG. For instance, a\nMAG is able to represent multilayer or time-varying networks, while both\nconcepts can also be combined to represent a multilayer time-varying network\nand even other higher-order networks. Since the MAG structure admits an\narbitrary (finite) number of aspects, it hence introduces a powerful modelling\nabstraction for networked complex systems. This paper formalizes the concept of\nMAG and derives theoretical results useful in the analysis of complex networked\nsystems modelled using the proposed MAG abstraction. We also present an\noverview of the MAG applicability."

    "summary": "A claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is said to be basic if there exists a matching $M\n\\subseteq E$ whose edges are strongly bisimplicial and such that each connected\ncomponent $C$ of $G - M$ is either a clique or a {claw, net}-free graph or\nsatisfies $\\alpha(G[C \\setminus V(M)]) \\le 3$. The Maximum Weight Stable Set\n(MWSS) Problem in a basic claw-free graph can be easily solved by first solving\nat most four MWSS problems in each connected component of $G - M$ in ${\\cal\nO}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$ time (\\cite{NobiliSassano15a,NobiliSassano15b}) and then\nsolving the MWSS Problem on a suitable line graph constructed from $G$ in\n${\\cal O}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$ time. In this paper we show that, by means of\nlifting operations, every claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ can be transformed, in\n${\\cal O}(|V|^2)$ time, into a basic claw-free graph $\\bar G(\\bar V, \\bar E)$\nsuch that $|\\bar V| = {\\cal O}(|V|)$ and a MWSS of $G$ can be obtained from a\nMWSS of $\\bar G$. This shows that the complexity of solving the MWSS Problem in\na claw-free graph $G(V, E)$ is ${\\cal O}(|V|^2 \\log(|V|))$, the same as in line\ngraphs."

Yet in spite of 30 years of\nextensive research no efficient algorithm has emerged to produce an independent\nset with (1+c)n ln(d)/d, for any fixed c>0. In this paper we prove that the\ncombinatorial structure of the independent set problem in random graphs\nundergoes a phase transition as the size k of the independent sets passes the\npoint k nln(d)/d. Roughly speaking, we prove that independent sets of size\nk>(1+c)n ln(d)/d form an intricately ragged landscape, in which local search\nalgorithms are bound to get stuck.

It is well known that this process undergoes a phase transition at n/2\nedges when, asymptotically almost surely, a linear-sized component appears.\nMoreover, this phase transition is continuous, i.e., in the limit the function\nf(c) denoting the fraction of vertices in the largest component in the process\nafter cn edge insertions is continuous. A variation of the Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\nprocess are the so-called Achlioptas processes in which in every step a random\npair of edges is drawn, and a fixed edge-selection rule selects one of them to\nbe included in the graph while the other is put back. Recently, Achlioptas,\nD'Souza and Spencer (2009) gave strong numerical evidence that a variety of\nedge-selection rules exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. However, Riordan\nand Warnke (2011) very recently showed that all Achlioptas processes have a\ncontinuous phase transition. In this work we prove discontinuous phase\ntransitions for a class of Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi-like processes in which in every\nstep we connect two vertices, one chosen randomly from all vertices, and one\nchosen randomly from a restricted set of vertices."

    "summary": "This article is set in the field of regulation networks modeled by discrete\ndynamical systems. It focuses on Boolean automata networks. In such networks,\nthere are many ways to update the states of every element. When this is done\ndeterministically, at each time step of a discretised time flow and according\nto a predefined order, we say that the network is updated according to\nblock-sequential update schedule (blocks of elements are updated sequentially\nwhile, within each block, the elements are updated synchronously). Many\nstudies, for the sake of simplicity and with some biologically motivated\nreasons, have concentrated on networks updated with one particular\nblock-sequential update schedule (more often the synchronous/parallel update\nschedule or the sequential update schedules). The aim of this paper is to give\nan argument formally proven and inspired by biological considerations in favour\nof the fact that the choice of a particular update schedule does not matter so\nmuch in terms of the possible and likely dynamical behaviours that networks may\ndisplay."

The\nmultiple edge insertion problem (MEI) asks for a drawing of G+F with the\nminimum number of pairwise edge crossings, such that the subdrawing of G is\nplane. Finding an exact solution to MEI is NP-hard for general F. We present\nthe first polynomial time algorithm for MEI that achieves an additive\napproximation guarantee -- depending only on the size of F and the maximum\ndegree of G, in the case of connected G. Our algorithm seems to be the first\ndirectly implementable one in that realm, too, next to the single edge\ninsertion. It is also known that an (even approximate) solution to the MEI\nproblem would approximate the crossing number of the F-almost-planar graph G+F,\nwhile computing the crossing number of G+F exactly is NP-hard already when\n|F|=1. Hence our algorithm induces new, improved approximation bounds for the\ncrossing number problem of F-almost-planar graphs, achieving constant-factor\napproximation for the large class of such graphs of bounded degrees and bounded\nsize of F."

    "summary": "In this paper we continue the study of the edge intersection graphs of one\n(or zero) bend paths on a rectangular grid. That is, the edge intersection\ngraphs where each vertex is represented by one of the following shapes:\n$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$, $\\urcorner$, $\\lrcorner$, and we consider zero bend\npaths (i.e., | and $-$) to be degenerate $\\llcorner$s. These graphs, called\n$B_1$-EPG graphs, were first introduced by Golumbic et al (2009). We consider\nthe natural subclasses of $B_1$-EPG formed by the subsets of the four single\nbend shapes (i.e., {$\\llcorner$}, {$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$},\n{$\\llcorner$,$\\urcorner$}, and {$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$,$\\urcorner$}) and we\ndenote the classes by [$\\llcorner$], [$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$],\n[$\\llcorner$,$\\urcorner$], and [$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$,$\\urcorner$]\nrespectively. Note: all other subsets are isomorphic to these up to 90 degree\nrotation. We show that testing for membership in each of these classes is\nNP-complete and observe the expected strict inclusions and incomparability\n(i.e., [$\\llcorner$] $\\subsetneq$ [$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$],\n[$\\llcorner$,$\\urcorner$] $\\subsetneq$ [$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$,$\\urcorner$]\n$\\subsetneq$ $B_1$-EPG; also, [$\\llcorner$,$\\ulcorner$] is incomparable with\n[$\\llcorner$,$\\urcorner$]). Additionally, we give characterizations and\npolytime recognition algorithms for special subclasses of Split $\\cap$\n[$\\llcorner$]."

    "summary": "Sand Pile Models are discrete dynamical systems emphasizing the phenomenon of\nSelf-Organized Criticality. From a configuration composed of a finite number of\nstacked grains, we apply on every possible positions (in parallel) two grain\nmoving transition rules. The transition rules permit one grain to fall to its\nright or left (symmetric) neighboring column if the difference of height\nbetween those columns is larger than 2. The model is nondeterministic and\ngrains always fall downward. We propose a study of the set of fixed points\nreachable in the Parallel Symmetric Sand Pile Model (PSSPM). Using a comparison\nwith the Symmetric Sand Pile Model (SSPM) on which rules are applied once at\neach iteration, we get a continuity property. This property states that within\nPSSPM we can't reach every fixed points of SSPM, but a continuous subset\naccording to the lexicographic order. Moreover we define a successor relation\nto browse exhaustively the sets of fixed points of those models."

In particular, we solve some open\nproblems and give linear time algorithms for ED and EED on dually chordal\ngraphs.\n  We extend the two problems to hypergraphs and show that ED remains\nNP-complete on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs, and is solvable in polynomial time on\nhypertrees, while EED is polynomial on alpha-acyclic hypergraphs and\nNP-complete on hypertrees."

    "summary": "Many applications motivate the distance measure between rankings, such as\ncomparing top-k lists and rank aggregation for voting, and intrigue great\ninterest to researchers. For example, for a search engine, the use of different\nranking algorithms may return different ranking lists. The effect of a ranking\nalgorithm can be estimated by computing the distance (similarity) between the\nresult ranking it returns and the appropriate ranking people expect. People may\nbe interested in only the first few items of result ranking, therefore the\nmetric for measuring the distance should emphasize on the items in higher\npositions. Besides, in an extreme case, if a result ranking is the total\nreverse of the expected ranking, then it is considered to be the worst ranking\nwith the maximum distance. Therefore, a metric is called for, which can satisfy\nboth of the two intuitions. To address this problem, we present a weighted\nmetric based on the classical Spearman's footrule metric to measure the\ndistance between two permutations of n objects. This metric can be applied in\nrank aggregation problem with a polynomial time algorithm, and produces a\n2-approximation for adopting the weighted Kendall's tau distance proposed by\nFarnoud et al."

FC-families are families for which it is proved that\nevery union-closed family containing them satisfies the Frankl's condition\n(e.g., in every union-closed family that contains a one-element set {a}, the\nelement a is contained in at least half of the sets, so families of the form\n{a} are the simplest FC-families). FC-families play an important role in\nattacking the Frankl's conjecture, since they enable significant search space\npruning. We present a formalization of the computer assisted approach for\nproving that a family is an FC-family. Proof-by-computation paradigm is used\nand the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL is used both to check mathematical\ncontent, and to perform (verified) combinatorial searches on which the proofs\nrely. FC-families known in the literature are confirmed, and a new FC-family is\ndiscovered."

    "summary": "Communication-based train control (CBTC) is gradually adopted in urban rail\ntransit systems, as it can significantly enhance railway network efficiency,\nsafety and capacity. Since CBTC systems are mostly deployed in underground\ntunnels and trains move in high speed, building a train-ground wireless\ncommunication system for CBTC is a challenging task. Modeling the tunnel\nchannels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC\nsystems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique\ncharacteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic\nmoving direction, and accurate train location information. In this paper, we\ndevelop a finite state Markov channel (FSMC) model for tunnel channels in CBTC\nsystems. The proposed FSMC model is based on real field CBTC channel\nmeasurements obtained from a business operating subway line. Unlike most\nexisting channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the\nproposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more\naccurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver\nis divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The\naccuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results\ngenerated from the model and the real field measurement results."

    "summary": "Based on the numerical representations by T basic vectors of a symbolic\nsequence consisting of T symbols, first, we prove mathematical that the total\nFourier spectrum of the sequence is the square of the length of the sequence.\nIn the meantime, we define the indicator sequences vector. Using the orthogonal\nor row orthogonal transformations of the indicator sequences vector, we\nconstruct some special numerical representations of the symbolic sequence and\ncharacterize the signal-to-noise ratios of the power spectrum of the numerical\nrepresentations. After calculating the discrete Fourier transform of those\nspecial numerical representations, the signal-to-noise ratios of them can be\nfigured out. Mathematical theorems prove that the signal-to-noise ratio of the\nFourier spectrum of those special representations of the symbolic sequence is\nT/(T-1) times the signal-to-noise ratio of the representation by T base\nvectors. The results are applied in analyzing the properties of the DNA\nsequences or protein sequences in the frequency domain, if one uses the\nsignal-to-noise ratios of special representations as the distinguishing\ncriterion, the distinguishing results only depend upon the distribution of the\nsymbols in the symbolic sequence and their mathematical constructions of\nrepresentations, but do not relate to the chemical or biological meanings of\nthe representations."

    "summary": "We investigate the computation of mappings from a set S^n to itself with \"in\nsitu programs\", that is using no extra variables than the input, and performing\nmodifications of one component at a time, hence using no memory. In this paper,\nwe survey this problem introduced in previous papers by the authors, we detail\nits close relation with rearrangeable multicast networks, and we provide new\nresults for both viewpoints.\n  A bijective mapping can be computed by 2n - 1 component modifications, that\nis by a program of length 2n - 1, a result equivalent to the rearrangeability\nof the concatenation of two reversed butterfly networks. For a general\narbitrary mapping, we give two methods to build a program with maximal length\n4n-3. Equivalently, this yields rearrangeable multicast routing methods for the\nnetwork formed by four successive butterflies with alternating reversions. The\nfirst method is available for any set S and practically equivalent to a known\nmethod in network theory. The second method, a refinement of the first,\ndescribed when |S| is a power of 2, is new and allows more flexibility than the\nknown method.\n  For a linear mapping, when S is any field, or a quotient of an Euclidean\ndomain (e.g. Z/sZ for any integer s), we build a program with maximal length 2n\n- 1. In this case the assignments are also linear, thereby particularly\nefficient from the algorithmic viewpoint, and giving moreover directly a\nprogram for the inverse when it exists. This yields also a new result on matrix\ndecompositions, and a new result on the multicast properties of two successive\nreversed butterflies. Results of this flavour were known only for the boolean\nfield Z/2Z."

In particular, one cannot expect a polynomial time\nalgorithm deciding if a bull-free graph has a stable set of size $k$, when $k$\nis part of the instance. Our main result in this paper is to show the existence\nof an FPT algorithm when we parameterize the problem by the solution size $k$.\nA polynomial kernel is unlikely to exist for this problem. We show however that\nour problem has a polynomial size Turing-kernel. More precisely, the hard cases\nare instances of size $O(k^5)$. As a byproduct, if we forbid odd holes in\naddition to the bull, we show the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for\nthe stable set problem. We also prove that the chromatic number of a bull-free\ngraph is bounded by a function of its clique number and the maximum chromatic\nnumber of its triangle-free induced subgraphs. All our results rely on a\ndecomposition theorem of bull-free graphs due to Chudnovsky which is modified\nhere, allowing us to provide extreme decompositions, adapted to our\ncomputational purpose."

An arc ordering is tight if, for any two\nhyperedges $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ is a nonempty subset of $B$ and $B$ is not\nequal to $V(H)$, the corresponding arcs share a common endpoint. We give\nsufficient conditions for $H$ to have, up to reversing, a unique arc ordering\nand a unique tight arc ordering. These conditions are stated in terms of\nconnectedness properties of $H$.\n  It is known that $G$ is a proper circular-arc graph exactly when its closed\nneighborhood hypergraph $N[G]$ admits a tight arc ordering. We explore\nconnectedness properties of $N[G]$ and prove that, if $G$ is a connected,\ntwin-free, proper circular-arc graph with non-bipartite complement, then $N[G]$\nhas, up to reversing, a unique arc ordering. If the complement of $G$ is\nbipartite and connected, then $N[G]$ has, up to reversing, two tight arc\norderings. As a corollary, we notice that in both of the two cases $G$ has an\nessentially unique intersection representation.

    "summary": "Emergence is a concept that is easy to exhibit, but very hard to formally\nhandle. This paper is about cubic sand grains moving around on nicely packed\ncolumns in one dimension (the physical sandpile is two dimensional, but the\nsupport of sand columns is one dimensional). The Kadanoff Sandpile Model is a\ndiscrete dynamical system describing the evolution of a finite number of\nstacked grains --as they would fall from an hourglass-- to a stable\nconfiguration (fixed point). Grains move according to the repeated application\nof a simple local rule until reaching a fixed point. The main interest of the\nmodel relies in the difficulty of understanding its behavior, despite the\nsimplicity of the rule. In this paper we prove the emergence of wave patterns\nperiodically repeated on fixed points. Remarkably, those regular patterns do\nnot cover the entire fixed point, but eventually emerge from a seemingly highly\ndisordered segment. The proof technique we set up associates arguments of\nlinear algebra and combinatorics, which interestingly allow to formally state\nthe emergence of regular patterns without requiring a precise understanding of\nthe chaotic initial segment's dynamic."

The proposed algorithm can easily be solved\nto obtain the explicit expression. This matches the explicit expression\nobtained from the popular conventional solutions, which confirms the\ncorrectness of the proposed algorithm.

An arc $v \\to w$ is\ndisimplicial when $N^-(w) \\to N^+(v)$ is a diclique. We show that the problem\nof finding the disimplicial arcs is equivalent, in terms of time and space\ncomplexity, to that of locating the transitive vertices. As a result, an\nefficient algorithm to find the bisimplicial edges of bipartite graphs is\nobtained. Then, we develop simple algorithms to build disimplicial elimination\nschemes, which can be used to generate bisimplicial elimination schemes for\nbipartite graphs.

Assume they select their\nseats uniformly and independently at random among the empty ones. A row of\nseats is narrow and an occupant who is already occupying a seat is blocking\npassage to new incoming theatregoers. As a consequence, occupying a specific\nseat depends on the courtesy of theatregoers and their willingness to get up so\nas to create free space that will allow passage to others. Thus, courtesy\nfacilitates and may well increase the overall seat occupancy of the theatre. We\nsay a theatregoer is courteous if (s)he will get up to let others pass.\nOtherwise, the theatregoer is selfish. A set of theatregoers is $p$-courteous\nif each theatregoer in the set is courteous with probability $p$, randomly and\nindependently.

We\nstudy and analyze interesting variants of this problem reflecting behaviour of\nthe theatregoers as entirely selfish, and $p$-courteous for a row of seats with\none or two entrances and as a consequence for a theatre with $m$ rows of seats\nwith multiple aisles.

They are based on a\ngeneralization of an efficient formal concept analysis algorithm called\nIn-Close2. Experimental results point to the necessity of having efficient\nenumerative biclustering algorithms and provide a valuable insight into the\nscalability of our family of algorithms and its sensitivity to user-defined\nparameters."

At the same time, we present a simpler proof that still yields\na \"right\" bound settling a question asked by Impagliazzo and Kabanets.\n  Next, we obtain a simple upper tail bound for polynomials with input\nvariables in $[0, 1]$ which are not necessarily independent, but obey a certain\ncondition inspired by Impagliazzo and Kabanets. The resulting bound is used by\nHolenstein and Sinha (FOCS, 2012) in the proof of a lower bound for the number\nof calls in a black-box construction of a pseudorandom generator from a one-way\nfunction.\n  We then show that the same technique yields the upper tail bound for the\nnumber of copies of a fixed graph in an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph,\nmatching the one given by Janson, Oleszkiewicz and Ruci\\'nski (Israel J.

From an algorithmic perspective, the\nrelated questions concern whether there are compact formulations even for\nproblems that are known to admit polynomial-time algorithms.\n  We propose a framework for proving lower bounds on the size of extended\nformulations. We do so by introducing a specific type of extended relaxations\nthat we call product relaxations and is motivated by the study of the\nSherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy. Then we show that for every approximate\nrelaxation of a polytope P, there is a product relaxation that has the same\nsize and is at least as strong. We provide a methodology for proving lower\nbounds on the size of approximate product relaxations by lower bounding the\nchromatic number of an underlying hypergraph, whose vertices correspond to\ngap-inducing vectors.\n  We extend the definition of product relaxations and our methodology to mixed\ninteger sets. However in this case we are able to show that mixed product\nrelaxations are at least as powerful as a special family of extended\nformulations. As an application of our method we show an exponential lower\nbound on the size of approximate mixed product formulations for the metric\ncapacitated facility location problem, a problem which seems to be intractable\nfor linear programming as far as constant-gap compact formulations are\nconcerned."

A new insight in\nthis note is that the local cluster coefficient C(x) in a finite simple graph\ncan be written as a relative characteristic length L(x) of the unit sphere S(x)\nwithin the unit ball B(x) of a vertex. This relation L(x) = 2-C(x) will allow\nto study clustering in more general metric spaces like Riemannian manifolds or\nfractals. If eta is the average of scalar curvature s(x), a formula mu ~\n1+log(epsilon)/log(eta) of Newman, Watts and Strogatz relates mu with the edge\ndensity epsilon and average scalar curvature eta telling that large curvature\ncorrelates with small characteristic length. Experiments show that the\nstatistical relation mu ~ log(1/nu) holds for random or deterministic\nconstructed networks, indicating that small clustering is often associated to\nlarge characteristic lengths and lambda=mu/log(nu) can converge in some graph\nlimits of networks.

    "summary": "Getting a labeling of vertices close to the structure of the graph has been\nproved to be of interest in many applications e.g., to follow smooth signals\nindexed by the vertices of the network. This question can be related to a graph\nlabeling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem. It consists in\nfinding a labeling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with\ndistinct integers such that the sum of (cyclic) difference of labels of\nadjacent vertices is minimized. Although theoretical results exist that give\noptimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither\nresults in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result.\nIn addition to this lack of theoretical knowledge, only a few methods have been\nproposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new\nheuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem,\nby following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm:\nthe first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which\nfollow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the\nJaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the\nmerging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a\npartial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the\ncyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in\nterms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs\nwhose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where\nthe consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to\nweighted graphs is also proposed."

    "summary": "We investigate the problem of modifying a graph into a connected graph in\nwhich the degree of each vertex satisfies a prescribed parity constraint. Let\n$ea$, $ed$ and $vd$ denote the operations edge addition, edge deletion and\nvertex deletion respectively. For any $S\\subseteq \\{ea,ed,vd\\}$, we define\nConnected Degree Parity Editing$(S)$ (CDPE($S$)) to be the problem that takes\nas input a graph $G$, an integer $k$ and a function $\\delta\\colon\nV(G)\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, and asks whether $G$ can be modified into a connected\ngraph $H$ with $d_{H}(v)\\equiv\\delta(v)~(\\bmod~2)$ for each $v\\in V(H)$, using\nat most $k$ operations from $S$. We prove that\n  1. if $S=\\{ea\\}$ or $S=\\{ea,ed\\}$, then CDPE($S$) can be solved in polynomial\ntime;\n  2. if $\\{vd\\} \\subseteq S\\subseteq \\{ea,ed,vd\\}$, then CDPE($S$) is\nNP-complete and W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$, even if $\\delta\\equiv 0$.\n  Together with known results by Cai and Yang and by Cygan, Marx, Pilipczuk,\nPilipczuk and Schlotter, our results completely classify the classical and\nparameterized complexity of the CDPE($S$) problem for all $S\\subseteq\n\\{ea,ed,vd\\}$. We obtain the same classification for a natural variant of the\nCDPE($S$) problem on directed graphs, where the target is a weakly connected\ndigraph in which the difference between the in- and out-degree of every vertex\nequals a prescribed value. As an important implication of our results, we\nobtain polynomial-time algorithms for the Eulerian Editing problem and its\ndirected variant."

    "summary": "For a set $A$ of $n$ people and a set $B$ of $m$ items, with each person\nhaving a preference list that ranks all items from most wanted to least wanted,\nwe consider the problem of matching every person with a unique item. A matching\n$M$ is called $\\epsilon$-popular if for any other matching $M'$, the number of\npeople who prefer $M'$ to $M$ is at most $\\epsilon n$ plus the number of those\nwho prefer $M$ to $M'$. In 2006, Mahdian showed that when randomly generating\npeople's preference lists, if $m/n > 1.42$, then a 0-popular matching exists\nwith $1-o(1)$ probability; and if $m/n < 1.42$, then a 0-popular matching\nexists with $o(1)$ probability. The ratio 1.42 can be viewed as a transition\npoint, at which the probability rises from asymptotically zero to\nasymptotically one, for the case $\\epsilon=0$. In this paper, we introduce an\nupper bound and a lower bound of the transition point in more general cases. In\nparticular, we show that when randomly generating each person's preference\nlist, if $\\alpha(1-e^{-1/\\alpha}) > 1-\\epsilon$, then an $\\epsilon$-popular\nmatching exists with $1-o(1)$ probability (upper bound); and if\n$\\alpha(1-e^{-(1+e^{1/\\alpha})/\\alpha}) < 1-2\\epsilon$, then an\n$\\epsilon$-popular matching exists with $o(1)$ probability (lower bound)."

We consider a theoretical model where the studied mathematical object\nrepresents a 2D twisted discrete thread linking two points. This thread is made\nof a chain of agents which are lost, i.e. they have no knowledge of the global\nsetting and no sense of direction. Thus, the modifications made by the agents\nare local and all the decisions use only minimal information about the local\nneighborhood. We introduce a random process such that the thread reorganizes\nitself efficiently to become a discrete line between these two points. The\nsecond question addressed here is to reorder a word by local flips in order to\nscatter the letters to avoid long successions of the same letter. These two\nquestions are equivalent.

The\neigenvalues of isomorphic graphs are identical. However, two graphs $ G_A $ and\n$ G_B $ can be isospectral but non-isomorphic. We first construct a graph\nisomorphism testing algorithm for friendly graphs and then extend it to\nunambiguous graphs. We show that isomorphisms can be detected by solving a\nlinear assignment problem. If the graphs possess repeated eigenvalues, which\ntypically correspond to graph symmetries, finding isomorphisms is much harder.\nBy repeatedly perturbing the adjacency matrices and by using properties of\neigenpolytopes, it is possible to break symmetries of the graphs and\niteratively assign vertices of $ G_A $ to vertices of $ G_B $, provided that an\nadmissible assignment exists. This heuristic approach can be used to construct\na permutation which transforms $ G_A $ into $ G_B $ if the graphs are\nisomorphic. The methods will be illustrated with several guiding examples."

We\nalso show that our constructions are locally explicit, i.e., one can find any\nentry in the construction in time poly-log in the size of the construction and\nthe field size. We also prove lower bounds that show that the sizes of our\ntesters and the densities are almost optimal.\n  Testers were used in [Bshouty, Testers and its application, ITCS 2014] to\nconstruct almost optimal perfect hash families, universal sets, cover-free\nfamilies, separating hash functions, black box identity testing and hitting\nsets. The dense testers in this paper shows that such constructions can be done\nin almost linear time, are locally explicit and can be made to be dense."

We mainly consider undirected graphs of $n$ vertices, where each\nedge has an associated set of discrete availability instances (labels). A\njourney from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ where\nsuccessive path edges have strictly increasing labels. A graph is temporally\nconnected iff there is a $(u,v)$-journey for any pair of vertices $u,v,~u\\not=\nv$. We first give a simple polynomial-time algorithm to check whether a given\ntemporal graph is temporally connected. We then consider the case in which a\ndesigner of temporal graphs can \\emph{freely choose} availability instances for\nall edges and aims for temporal connectivity with very small \\emph{cost}; the\ncost is the total number of availability instances used. We achieve this via a\nsimple polynomial-time procedure which derives designs of cost linear in $n$.\nWe also show that the above procedure is (almost) optimal when the underlying\ngraph is a tree, by proving a lower bound on the cost for any tree. However,\nthere are pragmatic cases where one is not free to design a temporally\nconnected graph anew, but is instead \\emph{given} a temporal graph design with\nthe claim that it is temporally connected, and wishes to make it more\ncost-efficient by removing labels without destroying temporal connectivity\n(redundant labels). Our main technical result is that computing the maximum\nnumber of redundant labels is APX-hard, i.e., there is no PTAS unless $P=NP$.\nOn the positive side, we show that in dense graphs with random edge\navailabilities, there is asymptotically almost surely a very large number of\nredundant labels. A temporal design may, however, be \\emph{minimal}, i.e., no\nredundant labels exist. We show the existence of minimal temporal designs with\nat least $n \\log{n}$ labels."

In\nthis paper, we consider a representation of the search region by a set of tight\nlocal upper bounds (in the minimization case) that can be derived from the\npoints of $N$. Local upper bounds play an important role in methods for\ngenerating or approximating the nondominated set of an MOO problem, yet few\nworks in the field of MOO address their efficient incremental determination. We\nrelate this issue to the state of the art in computational geometry and provide\nseveral equivalent definitions of local upper bounds that are meaningful in\nMOO. We discuss the complexity of this representation in arbitrary dimension,\nwhich yields an improved upper bound on the number of solver calls in\nepsilon-constraint-like methods to generate the nondominated set of a discrete\nMOO problem. We analyze and enhance a first incremental approach which operates\nby eliminating redundancies among local upper bounds. We also study some\nproperties of local upper bounds, especially concerning the issue of redundant\nlocal upper bounds, that give rise to a new incremental approach which avoids\nsuch redundancies. Finally, the complexities of the incremental approaches are\ncompared from the theoretical and empirical points of view."

    "summary": "The uncertainty principle states that a signal cannot be localized both in\ntime and frequency. With the aim of extending this result to signals on graphs,\nAgaskar&Lu introduce notions of graph and spectral spreads. They show that a\ngraph uncertainty principle holds for some families of unweighted graphs. This\nprinciple states that a signal cannot be simultaneously localized both in graph\nand spectral domains. In this paper, we aim to extend their work to weighted\ngraphs. We show that a naive extension of their definitions leads to\ninconsistent results such as discontinuity of the graph spread when regarded as\na function of the graph structure. To circumvent this problem, we propose\nanother definition of graph spread that relies on an inverse similarity matrix.\nWe also discuss the choice of the distance function that appears in this\ndefinition. Finally, we compute and plot uncertainty curves for families of\nweighted graphs."

This paper shows some\nproperties of matrices in order to facilitate the understanding and locating\nsymmetrizable matrices with specific characteristics, called positive\nquasi-Cartan companion matrices. Here, symmetrizable matrix are those which are\nsymmetric when multiplied by a diagonal matrix with positive entries called\nsymmetrizer matrix. Four algorithms are developed: one to decide whether there\nis a symmetrizer matrix; second to find such symmetrizer matrix; another to\ndecide whether the matrix is positive or not; and the last to find a positive\nquasi-Cartan companion matrix, if there exists. The third algorithm is used to\nprove that the problem to decide if a matrix has a positive quasi-Cartan\ncompanion is NP."

    "summary": "We consider a new probabilistic graph searching game played on graphs,\ninspired by the familiar game of Cops and Robbers. In Zombies and Survivors, a\nset of zombies attempts to eat a lone survivor loose on a given graph. The\nzombies randomly choose their initial location, and during the course of the\ngame, move directly toward the survivor. At each round, they move to the\nneighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the survivor; if there is\nmore than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly at random. The\nsurvivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a neighbouring vertex\nor staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if eventually one of them\neats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise, the survivor wins. The\nzombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies needed to play such\nthat the probability that they win is strictly greater than 1/2. We present\nasymptotic results for the zombie numbers of several graph families, such as\ncycles, hypercubes, incidence graphs of projective planes, and Cartesian and\ntoroidal grids."

    "summary": "The problem of maximizing non-negative submodular functions has been studied\nextensively in the last few years. However, most papers consider submodular set\nfunctions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case\nof submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a\ndeterministic $\\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function\non a bounded integer lattice $\\{0, \\ldots, C\\}^n$ using a Double Greedy\nframework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas\nused for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to\nset functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the\nso-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown\nthat many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer\nlattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the\ninteger lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and\nassume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that\nsome approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular,\nwe can obtain a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality\nconstraint and a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint. On\nthe other hand, for a knapsack constraint, the problem becomes significantly\nharder: even for monotone DR-submodular functions, we show that there is no\n$2^{(\\log (n^{1/2} - 1))^\\delta - 1}$-approximation for every $\\delta > 0$\nunder the assumption that $3-SAT$ cannot be solved in time $2^{n^{3/4 +\n\\epsilon}}$."

    "summary": "When we try to solve a system of linear equations, we can consider a simple\niterative algorithm in which an equation including only one variable is chosen\nat each step, and the variable is fixed to the value satisfying the equation.\nThe dynamics of this algorithm is captured by the peeling algorithm. Analyses\nof the peeling algorithm on random hypergraphs are required for many problems,\ne.g., the decoding threshold of low-density parity check codes, the inverting\nthreshold of Goldreich's pseudorandom generator, the load threshold of cuckoo\nhashing, etc. In this work, we deal with random hypergraphs including\nsuperlinear number of hyperedges, and derive the tight threshold for the\nsucceeding of the peeling algorithm. For the analysis, Wormald's method of\ndifferential equations, which is commonly used for analyses of the peeling\nalgorithm on random hypergraph with linear number of hyperedges, cannot be used\ndue to the superlinear number of hyperedges. A new method called the evolution\nof the moment generating function is proposed in this work."

In the\ntraditional Firefighter Problem, a fire breaks out at a given vertex of a\ngraph, and at each time interval spreads to neighbouring vertices that have not\nbeen protected, while a constant number of vertices are protected at each time\ninterval. In the version of the problem considered here, the firefighters are\nable to orient the edges of the graph before the fire breaks out, but the fire\ncould start at any vertex. We consider this problem when played on a graph in\none of several graph classes, and give upper and lower bounds on the number of\nvertices that can be saved. In particular, when one firefighter is available at\neach time interval, and the given graph is a complete graph, or a complete\nbipartite graph, we present firefighting strategies that are provably optimal.\nWe also provide lower bounds on the number of vertices that can be saved as a\nfunction of the chromatic number, of the maximum degree, and of the treewidth\nof a graph. For a subcubic graph, we show that the firefighters can save all\nbut two vertices, and this is best possible."

    "summary": "Given a bipartite graph G = (A u B, E) with strict preference lists and and\nedge e*, we ask if there exists a popular matching in G that contains the edge\ne*. We call this the popular edge problem. A matching M is popular if there is\nno matching M' such that the vertices that prefer M' to M outnumber those that\nprefer M to M'. It is known that every stable matching is popular; however G\nmay have no stable matching with the edge e* in it. In this paper we identify\nanother natural subclass of popular matchings called \"dominant matchings\" and\nshow that if there is a popular matching that contains the edge e*, then there\nis either a stable matching that contains e* or a dominant matching that\ncontains e*. This allows us to design a linear time algorithm for the popular\nedge problem. We also use dominant matchings to efficiently test if every\npopular matching in G is stable or not."

    "summary": "The problem of Distance Edge Labeling is a variant of Distance Vertex\nLabeling (also known as $L_{2,1}$ labeling) that has been studied for more than\ntwenty years and has many applications, such as frequency assignment.\n  The Distance Edge Labeling problem asks whether the edges of a given graph\ncan be labeled such that the labels of adjacent edges differ by at least two\nand the labels of edges of distance two differ by at least one. Labels are\nchosen from the set $\\{0,1,\\dots,\\lambda\\}$ for $\\lambda$ fixed.\n  We present a full classification of its computational complexity - a\ndichotomy between the polynomially solvable cases and the remaining cases which\nare NP-complete. We characterise graphs with $\\lambda \\le 4$ which leads to a\npolynomial-time algorithm recognizing the class and we show NP-completeness for\n$\\lambda \\ge 5$ by several reductions from Monotone Not All Equal 3-SAT."

While the model has been very\nextensively studied, the unperturbed (noiseless) version has largely resisted\nrigorous analysis, with most results in the literature pertaining to versions\nof the model in which noise is introduced into the dynamics so as to make it\namenable to standard techniques from statistical mechanics or stochastic\nevolutionary game theory. We rigorously analyse the one-dimensional version of\nthe model in which one of the two types is in the minority, and establish\nvarious forms of threshold behaviour. Our results are in sharp contrast with\nthe case when the distribution of the two types is uniform (i.e. each agent has\nequal chance of being of each type in the initial configuration), which was\nstudied by Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg."

For (un)directed hypergraphs, unique \\emph{prime factor decomposition\n(PFD)} results with respect to the Cartesian product are known. However, there\nis still a lack of algorithms, that compute the PFD of directed hypergraphs\nwith respect to the Cartesian product.\n  In this contribution, we focus on the algorithmic aspects for determining the\nCartesian prime factors of a finite, connected, directed hypergraph and present\na first polynomial time algorithm to compute its PFD. In particular, the\nalgorithm has time complexity $O(|E||V|r^2)$ for hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$, where\nthe rank $r$ is the maximum number of vertices contained in an hyperedge of\n$H$. If $r$ is bounded, then this algorithm performs even in\n$O(|E|\\log^2(|V|))$ time. Thus, our method additionally improves also the time\ncomplexity of PFD-algorithms designed for undirected hypergraphs that have time\ncomplexity $O(|E||V|r^6\\Delta^6)$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum number of\nhyperedges a vertex is contained in."

    "summary": "How to quantify the distance between any two partitions of a finite set is an\nimportant issue in statistical classification, whenever different clustering\nresults need to be compared. Developing from the traditional Hamming distance\nbetween subsets or cardinality of their symmetric difference, this work\nconsiders alternative metric distances between partitions. With one exception,\nall of them obtain as minimum-weight paths in the undirected graph\ncorresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. Firstly, by\nfocusing on the atoms of the lattice, one well-known partition distance is\nrecognized to be in fact the analog of the Hamming distance between subsets,\nwith weights on edges of the Hasse diagram determined through the number of\natoms in the unique maximal join-decomposition of partitions. Secondly, another\npartition distance known as \"variation of information\" is seen to correspond to\na minimum-weight path with edge weights determined by the entropy of\npartitions. These two distances are next compared in terms of their upper and\nlower bounds over all pairs of partitions that are complements of one another.\nWhat emerges is that the two distances share the same minimizers and\nmaximizers, while a much rawer behavior is observed for the partition distance\nwhich does not correspond to a minimum-weight path. The idea of measuring the\ndistance between partitions by means of minimum-weight paths in the Hasse\ndiagram is further explored by considering alternative symmetric and\norder-preserving/inverting partition functions (such as the the rank, in the\nsimplest case) for assigning weights to edges. What matters most, in such a\ngeneral setting, turns out to be whether the weighting function is supermodular\nor else submodular, as this makes any minimum-weight path visit the meet or\nelse the join of the two partitions, depending on order preserving/inverting."

    "summary": "Tree representations of (sets of) symmetric binary relations, or equivalently\nedge-colored undirected graphs, are of central interest, e.g.\\ in\nphylogenomics. In this context symbolic ultrametrics play a crucial role.\nSymbolic ultrametrics define an edge-colored complete graph that allows to\nrepresent the topology of this graph as a vertex-colored tree. Here, we are\ninterested in the structure and the complexity of certain combinatorial\nproblems resulting from considerations based on symbolic ultrametrics, and on\nalgorithms to solve them.\n  This includes, the characterization of symbolic ultrametrics that\nadditionally distinguishes between edges and non-edges of \\emph{arbitrary}\nedge-colored graphs $G$ and thus, yielding a tree representation of $G$, by\nmeans of so-called cographs. Moreover, we address the problem of finding\n\"closest\" symbolic ultrametrics and show the NP-completeness of the three\nproblems: symbolic ultrametric editing, completion and deletion. Finally, as\nnot all graphs are cographs, and hence, don't have a tree representation, we\nask, furthermore, what is the minimum number of cotrees needed to represent the\ntopology of an arbitrary non-cograph $G$. This is equivalent to find an optimal\ncograph edge $k$-decomposition $\\{E_1,\\dots,E_k\\}$ of $E$ so that each subgraph\n$(V,E_i)$ of $G$ is a cograph. We investigate this problem in full detail,\nresulting in several new open problems, and NP-hardness results.\n  For all optimization problems proven to be NP-hard we will provide integer\nlinear program (ILP) formulations to efficiently solve them."

A Sturmian word $s$ of slope $\\alpha$ can be written as a product of\nthese six minimal squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 X_3^2 \\cdots$. The square root of\n$s$ is defined to be the word $\\sqrt{s} = X_1 X_2 X_3 \\cdots$. The main result\nof this paper is that that $\\sqrt{s}$ is also a Sturmian word of slope\n$\\alpha$. Further, we characterize the Sturmian fixed points of the square root\nmap, and we describe how to find the intercept of $\\sqrt{s}$ and an occurrence\nof any prefix of $\\sqrt{s}$ in $s$. Related to the square root map, we\ncharacterize the solutions of the word equation $X_1^2 X_2^2 \\cdots X_n^2 =\n(X_1 X_2 \\cdots X_n)^2$ in the language of Sturmian words of slope $\\alpha$\nwhere the words $X_i^2$ are minimal squares of slope $\\alpha$.\n  We also study the square root map in a more general setting.

    "summary": "The reassembling of a simple connected graph G = (V,E) is an abstraction of a\nproblem arising in earlier studies of network analysis. Its simplest\nformulation is in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves, thus\nobtaining a collection of n=|V| one-vertex components. (2) We splice the two\nhalves of every edge together, not of all the edges at once, but in some\nordering \\Theta of the edges that minimizes two measures that depend on the\nedge-boundary degrees of assembled components.\n  The edge-boundary degree of a component A (subset of V) is the number of\nedges in G with one endpoint in A and one endpoint in V-A. We call the maximum\nedge-boundary degree encountered during the reassembling process the\nalpha-measure of the reassembling, and the sum of all edge-boundary degrees is\nits beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the\nreassembling of G is to determine an order \\Theta for splicing the edges that\nminimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).\n  There are different forms of reassembling. We consider only cases satisfying\nthe condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is\nspliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In\nthis report, we examine the particular case of linear reassembling, which\nrequires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already\nspliced edge. We delay other forms of reassembling to follow-up reports.\n  We prove that alpha-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cutwidth\nlinear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that\nbeta-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cost linear arrangement\n(MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other."

    "summary": "The global packing number problem arises from the investigation of optimal\nwavelength allocation in an optical network that employs Wavelength Division\nMultiplexing (WDM). Consider an optical network that is represented by a\nconnected, simple graph $G$. We assume all communication channels are\nbidirectional, so that all links and paths are undirected. It follows that\nthere are ${|G|\\choose 2}$ distinct node pairs associated with $G$, where $|G|$\nis the number of nodes in $G$. A path system $\\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ consists of\n${|G|\\choose 2}$ paths, one path to connect each of the node pairs. The global\npacking number of a path system $\\mathcal{P}$, denoted by\n$\\Phi(G,\\mathcal{P})$, is the minimum integer $k$ to guarantee the existence of\na mapping $\\omega:\\mathcal{P}\\to\\{1,2,\\ldots,k\\}$, such that\n$\\omega(P)\\neq\\omega(P')$ if $P$ and $P'$ have common edge(s). The global\npacking number of $G$, denoted by $\\Phi(G)$, is defined to be the minimum\n$\\Phi(G,\\mathcal{P})$ among all possible path systems $\\mathcal{P}$. If there\nis no wavelength conversion along any optical transmission path for any node\npair in the network, the global packing number signifies the minimum number of\nwavelengths required to support simultaneous communication for all pairs in the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, the focus is on ring networks, so that $G$ is a cycle.\nExplicit formulas for the global packing number of a cycle is derived. The\ninvestigation is further extended to chain networks. A path system,\n$\\mathcal{P}$, that enjoys $\\Phi(G,\\mathcal{P})=\\Phi(G)$ is called ideal. A\ncharacterization of ideal path systems is also presented. We also describe an\nefficient heuristic algorithm to assign wavelengths that can be applied to a\ngeneral network with more complicated traffic load."

In general, any set function reasonably assigning a cluster score to\ndata subsets gives rise to an objective function-based clustering problem. When\nconsidered in pseudo-Boolean form, cluster score enables to evaluate fuzzy\nclusters through multilinear extension MLE, while the global score of fuzzy\nclusterings simply is the sum over constituents fuzzy clusters of their MLE\nscore.

    "summary": "Spectral clustering is a popular and successful approach for partitioning the\nnodes of a graph into clusters for which the ratio of outside connections\ncompared to the volume (sum of degrees) is small. In order to partition into\n$k$ clusters, one first computes an approximation of the first $k$ eigenvectors\nof the (normalized) Laplacian of $G$, uses it to embed the vertices of $G$ into\n$k$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^k$, and then partitions the\nresulting points via a $k$-means clustering algorithm. It is an important task\nfor theory to explain the success of spectral clustering.\n  Peng et al. (COLT, 2015) made an important step in this direction. They\nshowed that spectral clustering provably works if the gap between the\n$(k+1)$-th and the $k$-th eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian is\nsufficiently large. They prove a structural and an algorithmic result. The\nalgorithmic result needs a considerably stronger gap assumption and does not\nanalyze the standard spectral clustering paradigm; it replaces spectral\nembedding by heat kernel embedding and $k$-means clustering by locality\nsensitive hashing.\n  We extend their work in two directions. Structurally, we improve the quality\nguarantee for spectral clustering by a factor of $k$ and simultaneously weaken\nthe gap assumption. Algorithmically, we show that the standard paradigm for\nspectral clustering works. Moreover, it even works with the same gap assumption\nas required for the structural result."

In particular, enumeration of the maximal bicliques has been of\ninterest in data analysis. Associated with this issue, bounds on the maximum\nnumber of bicliques were given. In this paper we study bounds on the minimun\nnumber of bicliques of a graph. Since adding false-twin vertices to $G$ does\nnot change the number of bicliques, we restrict to false-twin-free graphs.

    "summary": "There has been recent work [Louis STOC 2015] to analyze the spectral\nproperties of hypergraphs with respect to edge expansion. In particular, a\ndiffusion process is defined on a hypergraph such that within each hyperedge,\nmeasure flows from nodes having maximum weighted measure to those having\nminimum. The diffusion process determines a Laplacian, whose spectral\nproperties are related to the edge expansion properties of the hypergraph.\n  It is suggested that in the above diffusion process, within each hyperedge,\nmeasure should flow uniformly in the complete bipartite graph from nodes with\nmaximum weighted measure to those with minimum. However, we discover that this\nmethod has some technical issues. First, the diffusion process would not be\nwell-defined. Second, the resulting Laplacian would not have the claimed\nspectral properties.\n  In this paper, we show that the measure flow between the above two sets of\nnodes must be coordinated carefully over different hyperedges in order for the\ndiffusion process to be well-defined, from which a Laplacian can be uniquely\ndetermined. Since the Laplacian is non-linear, we have to exploit other\nproperties of the diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning\nthe \"second eigenvalue\" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that\nhigher order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current\nframework."

Studies on the\ndynamics of BANs, whether it is synchronous or asynchronous, have mainly\nfocused on monotonic networks, where fundamental questions on the links\nrelating their static and dynamical properties have been raised and addressed.\nThis paper explores analogous questions on asynchronous non-monotonic networks,\nxor-BANs, that are BANs where all the local transition functions are\nxor-functions. Using algorithmic tools, we give a general characterisation of\nthe asynchronous transition graphs for most of the cactus xor-BANs and strongly\nconnected xor-BANs.

It is required to find out, is there such an enumeration\nof the graphs vertices that the polynomials of the graphs are equal. We present\nalgorithms for the graph isomorphism problem that use the reduction. We prove\nthe propositions that justify the possibility of a numerical realization of the\nalgorithms for the general case of the graph isomorphism problem. The\nalgorithms perform equality checking of graphs modified $n$-variables\ncharacteristic polynomials. We show that probability of obtaining a wrong\nsolution of the graph isomorphism problem using recursive modification of the\nalgorithm is negligible if the algorithm parameter is sufficiently large. In\nthe course of its implementation, the algorithm checks the equality of the\ngraphs modified characteristic polynomials in predefined points. For\n$n$-vertices graph, the polynomial has $2^n$ coefficients so its value in some\npoint cannot be evaluated directly for large enough $n$. We show that we may\ncheck the equality of the polynomials in predefined points without direct\nevaluation of the polynomials values in these points. We prove that, for the\ngraphs on $n$ vertices, it is required $O(n^4)$ elementary machine operations\nand it is requred machine numbers with mantissa's length $O(n^2)$ to check\nequality of the graphs polynomials values in predefined points. In general, it\nneeds an exponential time to solve the $GI$ instance using the presented\napproach, but in practice, it is efficient even for compuationally hard\ninstances of the graph isomorphism problem."

For instance, we provide\npolynomial-time solvability when having to partition the rows and columns into\ntwo subsets each (meaning that one obtains four submatrices).

    "summary": "Motivated by the fact that in several cases a matching in a graph is stable\nif and only if it is produced by a greedy algorithm, we study the problem of\ncomputing a maximum weight greedy matching on weighted graphs, termed\nGreedyMatching. In wide contrast to the maximum weight matching problem, for\nwhich many efficient algorithms are known, we prove that GreedyMatching is\nstrongly NP-hard and APX-complete, and thus it does not admit a PTAS unless\nP=NP, even on graphs with maximum degree at most 3 and with at most three\ndifferent integer edge weights. Furthermore we prove that GreedyMatching is\nstrongly NP-hard if the input graph is in addition bipartite. Moreover we\nconsider two natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp\nthreshold behavior between NP-hardness and tractability. On the positive side,\nwe present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GreedyMatching on a\nspecial class of weighted graphs, called bush graphs. We highlight an\nunexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality\nmatching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms. We show that,\nif the approximation ratio of RGMA is $\\rho$, then for every $\\epsilon>0$ the\nrandomized MRG algorithm of [Aronson et al., Rand. Struct. Alg. 1995] gives a\n$(\\rho-\\epsilon)$-approximation for the maximum cardinality matching. We\nconjecture that a tight bound for $\\rho$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$; we prove our\nconjecture true for two subclasses of bush graphs. Proving a tight bound for\nthe approximation ratio of MRG on unweighted graphs (and thus also proving a\ntight value for $\\rho$) is a long-standing open problem [Poloczek and Szegedy;\nFOCS 2012]. This unexpected relation of our RGMA algorithm with the MRG\nalgorithm may provide new insights for solving this problem."

While\nmuch has been written about structured programming, an important issue has been\nleft unanswered: given an arbitrary, compiled program, describe an algorithm to\ndecide whether or not it is structured, that is, whether it conforms to the\nstated principles of structured programming. We refer to the classical concept\nof structured programming, as described by Dijkstra. By employing a graph model\nand graph-theoretic techniques, we formulate an efficient algorithm for\nanswering this question. To do so, we first introduce the class of graphs which\ncorrespond to structured programs, which we call Dijkstra Graphs. Our problem\nthen becomes the recognition of such graphs, for which we present a greedy\n$O(n)$-time algorithm. Furthermore, we describe an isomorphism algorithm for\nDijkstra graphs, whose complexity is also linear in the number of vertices of\nthe graph. Both the recognition and isomorphism algorithms have potential\nimportant applications, such as in code similarity analysis."

    "summary": "The concepts of orthology, paralogy, and xenology play a key role in\nmolecular evolution. Orthology and paralogy distinguish whether a pair of genes\noriginated by speciation or duplication. The corresponding binary relations on\na set of genes form complementary cographs. Allowing more than two types of\nancestral event types leads to symmetric symbolic ultrametrics. Horizontal gene\ntransfer, which leads to xenologous gene pairs, however, is inherent asymmetric\nsince one offspring copy \"jumps\" into another genome, while the other continues\nto be inherited vertically. We therefore explore here the mathematical\nstructure of the non-symmetric generalization of symbolic ultrametrics. Our\nmain results tie non-symmetric ultrametrics together with di-cographs (the\ndirected generalization of cographs), so-called uniformly non-prime\n2-structures, and hierarchical structures on the set of strong modules. This\nyields a characterization of relation structures that can be explained in terms\nof trees and types of ancestral events. This framework accommodates a\nhorizontal-transfer relation in terms of an ancestral event and thus, is\nslightly different from the the most commonly used definition of xenology."

To help with this, simple operations on a set\nof sequences called orthology relations may be employed. In addition to being\ninteresting from a practical point of view they are also attractive from a\ntheoretical perspective in that e. g. a characterization is known for when such\na relation is representable by a certain type of phylogenetic tree. For an\northology relation inferred from real biological data it is however generally\ntoo much to hope for that it satisfies that characterization. Rather than\ntrying to correct the data in some way or another which has its own drawbacks,\nas an alternative, we propose to represent an orthology relation $\\delta$ in\nterms of a structure more general than a phylogenetic tree called a\nphylogenetic network. To compute such a network in the form of a level-1\nrepresentation for $\\delta$, we introduce the novel {\\sc Network-Popping}\nalgorithm which has several attractive properties. In addition, we characterize\northology relations $\\delta$ on some set $X$ that have a level-1 representation\nin terms of eight natural properties for $\\delta$ as well as in terms for\nlevel-1 representations of orthology relations on certain subsets of $X$."

Then we prove similar\nresults for some subclasses of 2SIG and provide efficient algorithm for finding\ntheir clique number. We provide a matrix characterization for a subclass of\n2SIG graph."

In\norder to reconfigure around faults when they occur, it is also required that\nany two subsets of $k$ nodes of $X$ are in the same orbit of the action of its\nautomorphism group.

    "summary": "The paper is divided in to two parts. In the first part we present some new\nresults for the \\textit{routing via matching} model introduced by Alon et\nal\\cite{5}. This model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed\nnetwork. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where\na node exchanges data with its partner. Formally, given a connected graph $G$\nwith vertices labeled from $[1,...,n]$ and a permutation $\\pi$ giving the\ndestination of pebbles on the vertices the problem is to find a minimum step\nrouting scheme. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\\pi)$ of $G$ given\n$\\pi$. In this paper we present the following new results, which answer one of\nthe open problems posed in \\cite{5}: 1) Determining whether $rt(G,\\pi)$ is $\\le\n2$ can be done in $O(n^{2.5})$ deterministic time for any arbitrary connected\ngraph $G$. 2) Determining whether $rt(G,\\pi)$ is $\\le k$ for any $k \\ge 3$ is\nNP-Complete. In the second part we study a related property of graphs, which\nmeasures how easy it is to design sorting networks using only the edges of a\ngiven graph. Informally, \\textit{sorting number} of a graph is the minimum\ndepth sorting network that only uses edges of the graph. Many of the classical\nresults on sorting networks can be represented in this framework. We show that\na tree with maximum degree $\\Delta$ can accommodate a $O(\\min(n\\Delta^2,n^2))$\ndepth sorting network. Additionally, we give two instance of trees for which\nthis bound is tight."

In this work, we lift the investigations to\nthe case of directed graphs; herein, we focus on arc insertions. To this end,\nour general two-stage framework consists of efficiently solving a\nproblem-specific number problem transferring its solution to a solution for the\ngraph problem by applying flow computations. In this way, we obtain\nfixed-parameter tractability and polynomial kernelizability results, with the\ncentral parameter being the maximum vertex in- or outdegree of the output\ndigraph. Although there are certain similarities with the much better studied\nundirected case, the flow computation used in the directed case seems not to\nwork for the undirected case while f-factor computations as used in the\nundirected case seem not to work for the directed case."

    "summary": "We consider an asynchronous voting process on graphs which we call discordant\nvoting, and which can be described as follows. Initially each vertex holds one\nof two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions\ninteract pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The\nquantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of\ninteractions needed for all vertices have the same colour.\n  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and\nthe other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is\nincident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are\nbased on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are\nseveral ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a\nrandom discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour.\nPull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random\ndiscordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant\nedge and push the colour to the other end point.\n  We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on\nthe underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices,\nand an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious\nvoting, E(T) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph\nK_n, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has\nE(T)= Theta(2^n). For the cycle C_n all three protocols have E(T) = Theta(n^2).\nFor the star graph however, the pull protocol has E(T)=O(n^2), whereas the push\nprotocol is slower with E(T) = Theta(n^2 log(n)).\n  The wide variation in E(T) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the\nwell known model of synchronous pull voting, for which E(T) = O(n) on many\nclasses of expanders."

    "summary": "The theory of combinatorial designs has recently been used in order to build\nswitch-centric data centre networks incorporating a large number of servers, in\ncomparison with the popular Fat-Tree data centre network. The construction\nemployed, called the 3-step method, revolves around an appropriately chosen\n(but relatively small) bipartite graph and a transversal design. In this paper,\nwe clarify and extend these recent results. In particular, we prove the\nfollowing path diversity results: in a one-to-one context, we prove that in\nthese data centre networks there are pairwise link-disjoint paths joining all\nthe servers adjacent to some switch with all the servers adjacent to any other\nswitch so that we retain control of the path lengths (these results are optimal\nin terms of the numbers of paths constructed and we prove that we have a wide\nchoice of bipartite graph and transversal design to which we can apply the\n3-step method); and in a one-to-many context, we prove that there are pairwise\nlink-disjoint paths from all the servers adjacent to some switch to any\nidentically-sized collection of target servers where these target servers need\nnot be adjacent to the same switch (again, we keep control of the path\nlengths). Our constructions and analysis are undertaken on bipartite graphs\nwith the applications to data centre networks being easily derived. Our results\nstrengthen the overall competitiveness of data centre networks constructed\nusing the 3-step method, in comparison with Fat-Tree data centre networks, and,\nmore generally, show the potential of results and methodologies from\ncombinatorics to data centre network design."

    "summary": "The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality establishes a bound on the edge expansion\nof a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral\ntheory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the\nadjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open\nto define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used\nto estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.\n  In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing\nthe Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a\ndiffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure\nflows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum.\nSince the operator is non-linear, we have to exploit other properties of the\ndiffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning the \"second\neigenvalue\" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that higher order\nspectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework.\n  We consider a stochastic diffusion process, in which each vertex also\nexperiences Brownian noise from outside the system. We show a relationship\nbetween the second eigenvalue and the convergence behavior of the process.\n  We show that various hypergraph parameters like multi-way expansion and\ndiameter can be bounded using this operator's spectral properties. Since higher\norder spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead\nuse the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher order Cheeger-like\ninequalities. For any positive integer $k$, we give a polynomial time algorithm\nto compute an $O(\\log r)$-approximation to the $k$-th procedural minimizer,\nwhere $r$ is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this\napproximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis for constant values of\n$k$."

In best case\n$W'=O(|E|)$ where $|E|$ be the number of edges of $G$ and in worst case $W'=W,$\nthat is, $|E| \\leq W' \\leq W.$ In addition, we talk about a scaling property of\nthe algorithm and research a better bound of the parameter $W'$. An\nexperimental evaluation on randomly generated data shows that the proposed\nimprovement is significant in general."

The recognition problem for\nsimple-triangle graphs was a longstanding open problem, and recently a\npolynomial-time algorithm has been given by Mertzios [G. B.

To do this, we\nprovide a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the following restricted 2-chain\nsubgraph cover problem: Given a bipartite graph $G$ and a set of edges $F$ of\n$G$, find a 2-chain subgraph cover of $G$ such that one of two chain subgraphs\nhas no edges in $F$."

    "summary": "Pull voting is a classic method to reach consensus among $n$ vertices with\ndiffering opinions in a distributed network: each vertex at each step takes on\nthe opinion of a random neighbour. This method, however, suffers from two\ndrawbacks. Even if there are only two opposing opinions, the time taken for a\nsingle opinion to emerge can be slow and the final opinion is not necessarily\nthe initially held majority.\n  We refer to a protocol where 2 neighbours are contacted at each step as a\n2-sample voting protocol. In the two-sample protocol a vertex updates its\nopinion only if both sampled opinions are the same. Not much was known about\nthe performance of two-sample voting on general expanders in the case of three\nor more opinions. In this paper we show that the following performance can be\nachieved on a $d$-regular expander using two-sample voting. We suppose there\nare $k \\ge 3$ opinions, and that the initial size of the largest and second\nlargest opinions is $A_1, A_2$ respectively.\n  We prove that, if $A_1 - A_2 \\ge C n \\max\\{\\sqrt{(\\log n)/A_1}, \\lambda\\}$,\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the absolute second eigenvalue of matrix $P=Adj(G)/d$ and\n$C$ is a suitable constant, then the largest opinion wins in $O((n \\log\nn)/A_1)$ steps with high probability.\n  For almost all $d$-regular graphs, we have $\\lambda=c/\\sqrt{d}$ for some\nconstant $c>0$. This means that as $d$ increases we can separate an opinion\nwhose majority is $o(n)$, whereas $\\Theta(n)$ majority is required for $d$\nconstant.\n  This work generalizes the results of Becchetti et. al (SPAA 2014) for the\ncomplete graph $K_n$."

The \\textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem\nis to find a restrained dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph\n$G$, and a positive integer $k$, the \\textsc{Restrained Domination Decision}\nproblem is to decide whether $G$ has a restrained dominating set of cardinality\na most $k$. The \\textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is known to be\nNP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this\nNP-completeness result by showing that the \\textsc{Restrained Domination\nDecision} problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of\nchordal graphs. We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the\n\\textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in block graphs, a subclass of\ndoubly chordal graphs. The \\textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is\nalso known to be NP-complete for split graphs.

In addition, we also propose polynomial time\nalgorithms to solve the \\textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in\ncographs and chain graphs. Finally, we give a new improved upper bound on the\nrestrained domination number, cardinality of a minimum restrained dominating\nset in terms of number of vertices and minimum degree of graph. We also give a\nrandomized algorithm to find a restrained dominating set whose cardinality\nsatisfy our upper bound with a positive probability."

In this paper, we\ninitiate the systematic study of these concepts. We settle the questions that\nwere asked by Welzl about the niceness of (acyclic) USO. Niceness implies\nnatural upper bounds for Random Edge and we provide evidence that these are\ntight or almost tight in many interesting cases. Moreover, we show that Random\nEdge is polynomial on at least $n^{\\Omega(2^n)}$ many (possibly cyclic) USO. As\na bonus, we describe a derandomization of Random Edge which achieves the same\nasymptotic upper bounds with respect to niceness and discuss some algorithmic\nproperties of the reachmap."

At its core, the\nintroduced Graph-FRI-framework states that any K-sparse signal on the vertices\nof a circulant graph can be perfectly reconstructed from its\ndimensionality-reduced representation in the Graph Fourier domain of minimum\nsize 2K. By leveraging the recently developed theory of e-splines and e-spline\nwavelets on graphs, one can decompose this graph spectral transformation into\nthe multiresolution low-pass filtering operation with a graph e-spline filter,\nand subsequent transformation to the spectral graph domain; this allows to\ninfer a distinct sampling pattern, and, ultimately, the structure of an\nassociated coarsened graph, which preserves essential properties of the\noriginal, including circularity and, where applicable, the graph generating\nset."

We\nprove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense for jobs with arbitrary\nweights, and we give an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm for the problem\nwith equal weights."

Slepian functions, which arise\nas the solution of the Slepian concentration problem on the sphere, have\ndesirable properties for applications where measurements are only available\nwithin a spatially limited region on the sphere and/or a function is required\nto be analyzed over the spatially limited region. Slepian functions are\ncurrently not easily computed for large band-limits (L > 100) for an arbitrary\nspatial region due to high computational and large memory storage requirements.\nFor the special case of a polar cap, the symmetry of the region enables the\ndecomposition of the Slepian concentration problem into smaller sub-problems\nand consequently the efficient computation of Slepian functions for large\nband-limits. By exploiting the efficient computation of Slepian functions for\nthe polar cap region on the sphere, we develop a formulation, supported by a\nfast algorithm, for the computation of Slepian functions for an arbitrary\nspatial region to enable the analysis of modern data-sets that support large\nband-limits.

    "summary": "Nowhere dense classes of graphs are very general classes of uniformly sparse\ngraphs with several seemingly unrelated characterisations. From an algorithmic\nperspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform\nquasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be\nparticularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on\nnowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the\nequivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a\nnon-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,\nmaking them infeasible in practice.\n  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular\nfrom a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish\npolynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform\nquasi-wideness.\n  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem\nkernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in\npolynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only\n(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for\nevery fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating\nset problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs. This result is particularly\ninteresting, as it implies that for every class $\\mathcal{C}$ of graphs which\nis closed under subgraphs, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem admits a\nkernel on $\\mathcal{C}$ for every value of $r$ if, and only if, it admits a\npolynomial kernel for every value of $r$ (under the standard assumption of\nparameterized complexity theory that $\\mathrm{FPT} \\neq W[2]$)."

In the dynamic maximum flow problem, the goal is to\nmaximize the flow reaching the sink within a given time horizon $T$, while flow\nrequires a certain travel time to traverse an arc.\n  In our setting, we account for uncertain travel times of flow. We investigate\nmaximum flows over time under the assumption that at most $\\Gamma$ travel times\nmay be prolonged simultaneously due to delay. We develop and study a\nmathematical model for this problem. As the dynamic robust flow problem\ngeneralizes the static version, it is NP-hard to compute an optimal flow.\nHowever, our dynamic version is considerably more complex than the static\nversion. We show that it is NP-hard to verify feasibility of a given candidate\nsolution. Furthermore, we investigate temporally repeated flows and show that\nin contrast to the non-robust case (i.e., without uncertainties) they no longer\nprovide optimal solutions for the robust problem, but rather yield a worst case\noptimality gap of at least $T$. We finally show that for infinite delays, the\noptimality gap is at most $O(k \\log T)$, where $k$ is a newly introduced\ninstance characteristic.

Stable graphs are exactly the graphs\ninducing a matching game with non-empty core. They are also the graphs that\ninduce a network bargaining game with a balanced solution. A graph with\nweighted edges is called stable if the maximum weight of an integral matching\nequals the cost of a minimum fractional weighted vertex cover. If a graph is\nnot stable, it can be stabilized in different ways. Recent papers have\nconsidered the deletion or addition of edges and vertices in order to stabilize\na graph. In this work, we focus on a fine-grained stabilization strategy,\nnamely stabilization of graphs by fractionally increasing edge weights. We show\nthe following results for stabilization by minimum weight increase in edge\nweights (min additive stabilizer): (i) Any approximation algorithm for min\nadditive stabilizer that achieves a factor of $O(|V|^{1/24-\\epsilon})$ for\n$\\epsilon>0$ would lead to improvements in the approximability of\ndensest-$k$-subgraph. (ii) Min additive stabilizer has no $o(\\log{|V|})$\napproximation unless NP=P. Results (i) and (ii) together provide the first\nsuper-constant hardness results for any graph stabilization problem. On the\nalgorithmic side, we present (iii) an algorithm to solve min additive\nstabilizer in factor-critical graphs exactly in poly-time, (iv) an algorithm to\nsolve min additive stabilizer in arbitrary-graphs exactly in time exponential\nin the size of the Tutte set, and (v) a poly-time algorithm with approximation\nfactor at most $\\sqrt{|V|}$ for a super-class of the instances generated in our\nhardness proofs."

    "summary": "An upper dominating set in a graph is a minimal (with respect to set\ninclusion) dominating set of maximum cardinality. The problem of finding an\nupper dominating set is generally NP-hard. We study the complexity of this\nproblem in classes of graphs defined by finitely many forbidden induced\nsubgraphs and conjecture that the problem admits a dichotomy in this family,\ni.e. it is either NP-hard or polynomial-time solvable for each class in the\nfamily. A helpful tool to study the complexity of an algorithmic problem on\nfinitely defined classes of graphs is the notion of boundary classes. However,\nnone of such classes has been identified so far for the upper dominating set\nproblem. In the present paper, we discover the first boundary class for this\nproblem and prove the dichotomy for classes defined by a single forbidden\ninduced subgraph."

Each edge is associated with a demand and each vertex is\nassociated with a weight (cost), a capacity, and an available multiplicity. The\nobjective is to find a minimum-weight vertex multiset such that the demands of\nthe edges can be covered by the capacities of the vertices and the multiplicity\nof each vertex does not exceed its available multiplicity.\n  In this paper we present an $O(f)$ bi-approximation for VC-HC that gives a\ntrade-off on the number of augmented multiplicity and the cost of the resulting\ncover. In particular, we show that, by augmenting the available multiplicity by\na factor of $k \\ge 2$, a~cover with a cost ratio of\n$\\Big(1+\\frac{1}{k-1}\\Big)(f-1)$ to the optimal cover for the original instance\ncan be obtained.

    "summary": "When factorizing binary matrices, we often have to make a choice between\nusing expensive combinatorial methods that retain the discrete nature of the\ndata and using continuous methods that can be more efficient but destroy the\ndiscrete structure. Alternatively, we can first compute a continuous\nfactorization and subsequently apply a rounding procedure to obtain a discrete\nrepresentation. But what will we gain by rounding? Will this yield lower\nreconstruction errors? Is it easy to find a low-rank matrix that rounds to a\ngiven binary matrix? Does it matter which threshold we use for rounding? Does\nit matter if we allow for only non-negative factorizations? In this paper, we\napproach these and further questions by presenting and studying the concept of\nrounding rank. We show that rounding rank is related to linear classification,\ndimensionality reduction, and nested matrices. We also report on an extensive\nexperimental study that compares different algorithms for finding good\nfactorizations under the rounding rank model."

    "summary": "Approximate random $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a well studied problem in\ncomputer science and statistical physics. It amounts to constructing a\n$k$-colouring of $G$ which is distributed close to {\\em Gibbs distribution} in\npolynomial time. Here, we deal with the problem when the underlying graph is an\ninstance of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, where $d$ is a\nsufficiently large constant.\n  We propose a novel efficient algorithm for approximate random $k$-colouring\n$G(n,d/n)$ for any $k\\geq (1+\\epsilon)d$. To be more specific, with probability\nat least $1-n^{-\\Omega(1)}$ over the input instances $G(n,d/n)$ and for $k\\geq\n(1+\\epsilon)d$, the algorithm returns a $k$-colouring which is distributed\nwithin total variation distance $n^{-\\Omega(1)}$ from the Gibbs distribution of\nthe input graph instance.\n  The algorithm we propose is neither a MCMC one nor inspired by the message\npassing algorithms proposed by statistical physicists. Roughly the idea is as\nfollows: Initially we remove sufficiently many edges of the input graph. This\nresults in a \"simple graph\" which can be $k$-coloured randomly efficiently. The\nalgorithm colours randomly this simple graph. Then it puts back the removed\nedges one by one. Every time a new edge is put back the algorithm updates the\ncolouring of the graph so that the colouring remains random.\n  The performance of the algorithm depends heavily on certain spatial\ncorrelation decay properties of the Gibbs distribution."

The SUS problem is, given a\nstring S, to preprocess S so that for any subsequent query interval [s,t] all\nthe SUSs for interval [s,t] can be answered quickly. When s = t, we call the\nSUSs for [s,t] as point SUSs, and when s \\leq t, we call the SUSs for [s,t] as\ninterval SUSs.

Therefore, Brach, Cygan,\n{\\L}acki, and Sankowski [SODA 2016] introduced two natural deterministic\nconditions: (1) a power-law upper bound on the degree distribution (PLB-U) and\n(2) power-law neighborhoods, that is, the degree distribution of neighbors of\neach vertex is also upper bounded by a power law (PLB-N). They showed that many\nreal-world networks satisfy both deterministic properties and exploit them to\ndesign faster algorithms for a number of classical graph problems.\n  We complement the work of Brach et al. by showing that some well-studied\nrandom graph models exhibit both the mentioned PLB properties and additionally\nalso a power-law lower bound on the degree distribution (PLB-L). All three\nproperties hold with high probability for Chung-Lu Random Graphs and Geometric\nInhomogeneous Random Graphs and almost surely for Hyperbolic Random Graphs. As\na consequence, all results of Brach et al. also hold with high probability or\nalmost surely for those random graph classes.\n  In the second part of this work we study three classical NP-hard\ncombinatorial optimization problems on PLB networks. It is known that on\ngeneral graphs with maximum degree {\\Delta}, a greedy algorithm, which chooses\nnodes in the order of their degree, only achieves an {\\Omega}(ln\n{\\Delta})-approximation for Minimum Vertex Cover and Minimum Dominating Set,\nand an {\\Omega}({\\Delta})-approximation for Maximum Independent Set. We prove\nthat the PLB-U property suffices for the greedy approach to achieve a\nconstant-factor approximation for all three problems. We also show that all\nthree combinatorial optimization problems are APX-complete, even if all\nPLB-properties hold."

    "summary": "Let G denote a graph and let K be a subset of vertices that are a set of\ntarget vertices of G. The K-terminal reliability of G is defined as the\nprobability that all target vertices in K are connected, considering the\npossible failures of non-target vertices of G. The problem of computing\nK-terminal reliability is known to be #P-complete for polygon-circle graphs,\nand can be solved in polynomial-time for t-polygon graphs, which are a subclass\nof polygon-circle graphs. The class of circle graphs is a subclass of\npolygon-circle graphs and a superclass of t-polygon graphs. Therefore, the\nproblem of computing K-terminal reliability for circle graphs is of particular\ninterest. This paper proves that the problem remains #P-complete even for\ncircle graphs. Additionally, this paper proposes a linear-time algorithm for\nsolving the problem for proper circular-arc graphs, which are a subclass of\ncircle graphs and a superclass of proper interval graphs."

    "summary": "We prove that triangulated IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs can be recognized\nin cubic time.\n  A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing\nper edge. A drawing is IC-planar if, in addition, each vertex is incident to at\nmost one crossing edge and NIC-planar if two pairs of crossing edges share at\nmost one vertex. In a triangulated drawing each face is a triangle. In\nconsequence, planar-maximal and maximal IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs can be\nrecognized in O(n^5) time and maximum and optimal ones in O(n^3) time. In\ncontrast, recognizing 3-connected IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs is\nNP-complete, even if the graphs are given with a rotation system which\ndescribes the cyclic ordering of the edges at each vertex. Our results\ncomplement similar ones for 1-planar graphs."

    "summary": "A cocomparability graph is a graph whose complement admits a transitive\norientation. An interval graph is the intersection graph of a family of\nintervals on the real line. In this paper we investigate the relationships\nbetween interval and cocomparability graphs. This study is motivated by recent\nresults Corneil,Dalton, Habib (2013) and Dusart, Habib (2016) and that show\nthat for some problems, the algorithm used on interval graphs can also be used\nwith small modifications on cocomparability graphs. Many of these algorithms\nare based on graph searches that preserve cocomparability orderings.\n  First we propose a characterization of cocomparability graphs via a lattice\nstructure on the set of their maximal cliques. Using this characterization we\ncan prove that every maximal interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph $G$\nis also a maximal chordal subgraph of $G$. Although the size of this lattice of\nmaximal cliques can be exponential in the size of the graph, it can be used as\na framework to design and prove algorithms on cocomparability graphs. In\nparticular we show that a new graph search, namely Local Maximal Neighborhood\nSearch (LocalMNS) leads to an $O(n+mlogn)$ time algorithm to find a maximal\ninterval subgraph of a cocomparability graph. Similarly we propose a linear\ntime algorithm to compute all simplicial vertices in a cocomparability graph.\nIn both cases we improve on the current state of knowledge."

    "summary": "The subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) distance metric is a fundamental way of\ncomparing evolutionary trees. It has wide-ranging applications, such as to\nstudy lateral genetic transfer, viral recombination, and Markov chain Monte\nCarlo phylogenetic inference. Although the rooted version of SPR distance can\nbe com puted relatively efficiently between rooted trees using\nfixed-parameter-tractable algorithms, in the unrooted case previous algorithms\nare unable to compute distances larger than 7. One important tool for efficient\ncomputation in the rooted case is called chain reduction, which replaces an\narbitrary chain of subtrees identical in both trees with a chain of three\nleaves. Whether chain reduction preserves SPR distance in the unrooted case has\nremained an open question since it was conjectured in 2001 by Allen and Steel,\nand was presented as a challenge question at the 2007 Isaac Newton Institute\nfor Mathematical Sciences program on phylogenetics.\n  In this paper we prove that chain reduction preserves the unrooted SPR\ndistance. We do so by introducing a structure called a socket agreement forest\nthat restricts edge modification to predetermined socket vertices, permitting\ndetailed analysis and modification of SPR move sequences. This new chain\nreduction theorem reduces the unrooted distance problem to a linear size\nproblem kernel, substantially improving on the previous best quadratic size\nkernel."

    "summary": "Cognitive control -- the capacity to carry out goal-directed behavior in the\nface of compelling or distracting alternatives -- is a hallmark of human\ncognitive function. One of the defining, and best documented findings\nconcerning cognitive control is the stark limitation on its ability for\nmultitasking -- the simultaneous execution of multiple control-demanding tasks.\nDespite a large empirical literature in support of this observation, there is\nstill no satisfying explanation for the cause of the limitation. Here we\nexamine a new graph-theoretic approach to analyzing the constraints imposed by\ncrosstalk in network architectures. In this analysis, tasks are represented as\nedges in a bipartite graph $G=(A,B)$, and a set of tasks can be performed\nsimultaneously if the edges representing them form an induced matching in $G$.\nWe define a new measure of multitasking capacity of such networks, saying that\n$G$ has multitasking capacity $\\alpha(k) \\in (0,1]$ if every matching $M$ of\nsize at most $k$ contains an induced matching of size at least $\\alpha(k)|M|$.\nAssuming $|A|=|B|=n$, we prove that there are graphs of average degree $d$,\nsuch that $\\alpha(k)>0$ is independent of $d$ and $k$ approaches $n/d$. We also\nprove that for every $d$-regular graph, $\\alpha(n)=O(1/\\sqrt{d})$. These\nresults offer a fresh perspective on the strengths and limitations of\ncomputational architectures that are designed to perform many tasks\nsimultaneously."

    "summary": "Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have been widely studied both\nin AI and complexity theory. Empirically and theoretically, many random CSPs\nhave been shown to exhibit a phase transition. As the ratio of constraints to\nvariables passes certain thresholds, they transition from being almost\ncertainly satisfiable to unsatisfiable. The exact location of this threshold\nhas been thoroughly investigated, but only for certain common classes of\nconstraints. In this paper, we present new bounds for the location of these\nthresholds in boolean CSPs. Our main contribution is that our bounds are fully\ngeneral, and apply to any fixed constraint function that could be used to\ngenerate an ensemble of random CSPs. These bounds rely on a novel Fourier\nanalysis and can be easily computed from the Fourier spectrum of a constraint\nfunction. Our bounds are within a constant factor of the exact threshold\nlocation for many well-studied random CSPs. We demonstrate that our bounds can\nbe easily instantiated to obtain thresholds for many constraint functions that\nhad not been previously studied, and evaluate them experimentally."

As experts conduct the\nindividual assessments, they may not always be consistent. The level of\ninconsistency among individual assessments is widely accepted as a measure of\nthe ranking quality. The higher the ranking quality, the greater its\ncredibility. One way to determine the level of inconsistency among the paired\ncomparisons is to calculate the value of the inconsistency index. One of the\nearliest and most widespread inconsistency indexes is the consistency\ncoefficient defined by Kendall and Babington Smith. In their work, the authors\nconsider binary pairwise comparisons, i.e., those where the result of an\nindividual comparison can only be: better or worse. The presented work extends\nthe Kendall and Babington Smith index to sets of paired comparisons with ties.\nHence, this extension allows the decision makers to determine the inconsistency\nfor sets of paired comparisons, where the result may also be \"equal.\" The\narticle contains a definition and analysis of the most inconsistent set of\npairwise comparisons with and without ties. It is also shown that the most\ninconsistent set of pairwise comparisons with ties represents a special case of\nthe more general set cover problem."

Also,\nif $f$ has small goal value, it indicates a close relationship between two\nother measures of the complexity of $f$, its average-case decision tree\ncomplexity and its average-case certificate complexity. In this paper, we\nexplore the goal value measure in detail. We present bounds on the goal values\nof arbitrary and specific Boolean functions, and present results on properties\nof the measure.

We are given an undirected tree $G = (V,E)$, an additional set of\nedges $L$ called links and a cost vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^L_{\\geq 1}$. The\ngoal is to choose a minimum cost subset $S \\subseteq L$ such that $G = (V, E\n\\cup S)$ is $2$-edge-connected. In the unweighted case, that is, when we have\n$c_\\ell = 1$ for all $\\ell \\in L$, the problem is called the tree augmentation\nproblem (TAP).\n  Both problems are known to be APX-hard, and the best known approximation\nfactors are $2$ for WTAP by (Frederickson and J\\'aJ\\'a, '81) and $\\tfrac{3}{2}$\nfor TAP due to (Kortsarz and Nutov, TALG '16). In the case where all link costs\nare bounded by a constant $M$, (Adjiashvili, SODA '17) recently gave a $\\approx\n1.96418+\\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm for WTAP under this assumption.\nThis is the first approximation with a better guarantee than $2$ that does not\nrequire restrictions on the structure of the tree or the links.\n  In this paper, we improve Adjiashvili's approximation to a\n$\\frac{3}{2}+\\varepsilon$-approximation for WTAP under the bounded cost\nassumption. We achieve this by introducing a strong LP that combines\n$\\{0,\\frac{1}{2}\\}$-Chv\\'atal-Gomory cuts for the standard LP for the problem\nwith bundle constraints from Adjiashvili. We show that our LP can be solved\nefficiently and that it is exact for some instances that arise at the core of\nAdjiashvili's approach. This results in the improved guarantee of\n$\\frac{3}{2}+\\varepsilon$. For TAP, this is the best known LP-based result, and\nmatches the bound of $\\frac{3}{2}+\\varepsilon$ achieved by the best SDP-based\nalgorithm due to (Cheriyan and Gao, arXiv '15)."

This NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem\nhas recently found applications, e.g., in the context of phylogenetics.\nEfficient heuristics are hence of practical importance.

The methodology evaluates the\npolynomial at efficiently computable approximations of suitable irrational\npoints. In contrast to the classical technique of DeMillo, Lipton, Schwartz,\nand Zippel, this methodology can decrease the error probability by increasing\nthe precision of the approximations instead of using more random bits.\nConsequently, randomized algorithms that use the classical technique can\ngenerally be improved using the new methodology. To demonstrate the\nmethodology, we discuss two nontrivial applications. The first is to decide\nwhether a graph has a perfect matching in parallel. Our new NC algorithm uses\nfewer random bits while doing less work than the previously best NC algorithm\nby Chari, Rohatgi, and Srinivasan. The second application is to test the\nequality of two multisets of integers. Our new algorithm improves upon the\npreviously best algorithms by Blum and Kannan and can speed up their checking\nalgorithm for sorting programs on a large range of inputs."

We\nassume no three vertices are collinear. The rectilinear crossing number of G is\nthe fewest number of edge crossings attainable over all rectilinear drawings of\nG. Thanks to Richard Guy, exact values of the rectilinear crossing number of\nK_n, the complete graph on n vertices, for n = 3,...,9, are known (Guy 1972,\nWhite and Beinke 1978, Finch 2000, Sloanes A014540). Since 1971, thanks to the\nwork of David Singer (1971, Gardiner 1986), the rectilinear crossing number of\nK_10 has been known to be either 61 or 62, a deceptively innocent and\ntantalizing statement. The difficulty of determining the correct value is\nevidenced by the fact that Singer's result has withstood the test of time. In\nthis paper we use a purely combinatorial argument to show that the rectilinear\ncrossing number of K_10 is 62. Moreover, using this result, we improve an\nasymptotic lower bound for a related problem. Finally, we close with some new\nand old open questions that were provoked, in part, by the results of this\npaper, and by the tangled history of the problem itself."

There are several models of simple\nfolds; the simplest one-layer simple fold rotates a portion of paper about a\ncrease in the paper by +-180 degrees. We first consider the analogous questions\nin one dimension lower -- bending a segment into a flat object -- which lead to\ninteresting problems on strings. We develop efficient algorithms for the\nrecognition of simply foldable 1D crease patterns, and reconstruction of a\nsequence of simple folds. Indeed, we prove that a 1D crease pattern is\nflat-foldable by any means precisely if it is by a sequence of one-layer simple\nfolds.\n  Next we explore simple foldability in two dimensions, and find a surprising\ncontrast: ``map'' folding and variants are polynomial, but slight\ngeneralizations are NP-complete. Specifically, we develop a linear-time\nalgorithm for deciding foldability of an orthogonal crease pattern on a\nrectangular piece of paper, and prove that it is (weakly) NP-complete to decide\nfoldability of (1) an orthogonal crease pattern on a orthogonal piece of paper,\n(2) a crease pattern of axis-parallel and diagonal (45-degree) creases on a\nsquare piece of paper, and (3) crease patterns without a mountain/valley\nassignment."

We formulate\nit as a combinatorial optimization problem of arranging numbers in a matrix to\nminimize the maximum difference between the largest and the smallest number in\nany row or column. We develop a technique for deriving lower bounds on the\ndistortion at given channel rates. The approach is constructive, thus allowing\nan algorithm that gives a closely matching upper bound. For the case of two\ncommunication channels with equal rates, the bounds coincide, thus giving the\nprecise lowest achievable distortion at fixed rates. The bounds are within a\nsmall constant for higher number of channels. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first result concerning systems with more than two communication\nchannels. The problem is also equivalent to the bandwidth minimization problem\nof Hamming graphs."

In particular, we consider a sequence of entirely arbitrary\ndistinct values arriving in random order, and must devise strategies for\nselecting low values followed by high values in such a way as to maximize the\nexpected gain in rank from low values to high values.\n  First, we consider a scenario in which only one low value and one high value\nmay be selected. We give an optimal on-line algorithm for this scenario, and\nanalyze it to show that, surprisingly, the expected gain is n-O(1), and so\ndiffers from the best possible off-line gain by only a constant additive term\n(which is, in fact, fairly small -- at most 15).\n  In a second scenario, we allow multiple nonoverlapping low/high selections,\nwhere the total gain for our algorithm is the sum of the individual pair gains.\nWe also give an optimal on-line algorithm for this problem, where the expected\ngain is n^2/8-\\Theta(n\\log n). An analysis shows that the optimal expected\noff-line gain is n^2/6+\\Theta(1), so the performance of our on-line algorithm\nis within a factor of 3/4 of the best off-line strategy."

If G is triconnected or triangulated, our bit count decreases to 2m+3n\n+ o(m+n) or 2m+2n + o(m+n), respectively. If G is simple, our bit count is\n(5/3)m+(5+1/k)n + o(n) for any constant k > 0. Thus, if a simple G is also\ntriconnected or triangulated, then 2m+2n + o(n) or 2m+n + o(n) bits suffice,\nrespectively.\n  If only adjacency queries are supported, the bit counts for a general G and a\nsimple G become 2m+(14/3)n + o(m+n) and (4/3)m+5n + o(n), respectively.\n  If we only need to reconstruct G from its code, a simple and triconnected G\nuses roughly 2.38m + O(1) bits while the best previous bound by He, Kao, and Lu\nis 2.84m."

A basic task in wireless network is that of\nbroadcasting a message (created by a fixed source node) to all nodes of the\nnetwork. The multi-broadcast that consists in performing a set of r independent\nbroadcasts. In this paper, we study the completion and the termination time of\ndistributed protocols for both the (single) broadcast and the multi-broadcast\noperations on unknown networks as functions of the number of nodes n, the\nmaximum eccentricity D, the maximum in-degree Delta, and the congestion c of\nthe networks. We establish new connections between these operations and some\ncombinatorial concepts, such as selective families, strongly-selective families\n(also known as superimposed codes), and pairwise r-different families. Such\nconnections, combined with a set of new lower and upper bounds on the size of\nthe above families, allow us to derive new lower bounds and new distributed\nprotocols for the broadcast and multi-broadcast operations. In particular, our\nupper bounds are almost tight and improve exponentially over the previous\nbounds when D and Delta are polylogarithmic in n. Network topologies having\n``small'' eccentricity and ``small'' degree (such as bounded-degree expanders)\nare often used in practice to achieve efficient communication."
