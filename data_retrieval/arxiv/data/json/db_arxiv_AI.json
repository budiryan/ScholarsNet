    "summary": "Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search\ntree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress\ntoward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which\nbacktrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this\ndifficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed\nbacktracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful\ncontrol information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by\nearlier approaches."

    "summary": "Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that\nunder certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making\nwith minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach\nto distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource\nallocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive\nequilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for\ndefining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their\ncorresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach\nfor a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of\nthe decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient\ndistributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be\nmeaningfully analyzed in economic terms."

    "summary": "We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure\nfor propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the\nnumber of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a\nmore complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by\nshowing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.\nThis work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to\nimprove understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms."

    "summary": "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages."

We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS\nwhose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new\nfeatures studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized\nin three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological\nlanguage, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number\nrestrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion\nstatements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular\ncase. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction\nservices (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a\nsound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge\nbases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a\nbyproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in\nALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is\nadopted."

We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R)\nprograms whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the\ncontinuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action\nis based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter\nbinding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other\ncircuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it\nis constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the\ncontingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R\nprograms are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is\ncompatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe\nsome experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and\nactual mobile robots."

Several\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for\nbetter symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a\ngeneral-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree\nlearning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the\ngeneralization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different\nrepresentations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen\nverbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why\nthis should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for\ndecision-tree learning algorithms."

By\nreplacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of\nSUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the\ndata. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies\nsimilar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an\napproximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational\nconstraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\nbackground knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\nappropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate\nSUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data\nand to discover structural concepts important to the domain.

    "summary": "Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we\nconsider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a\ndegree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning\nabout a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all\npossible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB,\nand compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of\nbelief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show\nthat when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary\npredicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N\ngrows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can\nuse a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result\nis in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence,\nbut is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the\nlimitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates\nseems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the\nconnection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These\nobservations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of\nmaximum-entropy methods."

First, sentence level processing locates relevant\npieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse\nprocessing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the\nfirst step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing\nany relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can\nachieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to\nunderstand relationships among separately identified pieces of information.\nPrevious information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly\nbecause they were not required to link up each piece of information with other\npieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a\nstructured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper\nreports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information\nusing a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high\nlevel of system performance which approaches human performance."

In this paper, we\npresent a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order\nplanning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We\nshow that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread\nintuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For\ninstance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon\nthe search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the\nunderlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners."

    "summary": "Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown\nfunction f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k\n``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training\nexamples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning\nproblems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the\ndecision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning\nalgorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and\napplication of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output\nrepresentations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique\nin which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output\nrepresentation. We show that these output representations improve the\ngeneralization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of\nmulticlass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust\nwith respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of\ndistributed representations to particular classes, and the application of\noverfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we\nshow that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can\nprovide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results\ndemonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method\nfor improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass\nproblems."

    "summary": "The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan\ndebugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or\nrepairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a\ndomain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound,\ncomplete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the\nliterature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of\npartial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from\nnode to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a\nlibrary plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for\nthe search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same\nrefinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract\nconstraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that\nthe adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its\nsystematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any\nparts of the graph."

Currently the most important application of these methods is to\ntemporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of\nTD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general\nimplementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement\nlearning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional\napproach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both\ninefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences)\nprocedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates\nTD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used\nwith arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is\nderived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far.\nEncouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda\n&gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning\nspeedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning."

There are two challenges that theory revision and other\ntheory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for\nthe initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the\noriginal representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more\naccurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky,\ncumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a\ncoarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that\nproduce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for\naccomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required.\nConsequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible\nrepresentation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision\nsystems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and\nweaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the\nunderlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided\nconstructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over\nprevious theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior,\nlimitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction."

We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is\ninadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a\nresult, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI,\nhindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded\noptimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a\nsolution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture\nand the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property\nfor a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time\nenvironments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated\nmail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded\noptimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical\ncomplexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs\nthat are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO\nprograms can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude\nwith a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical\nbasis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and\ngame theory."

    "summary": "There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle\nplanning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has\nled to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the \"best\" possible\nplanning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment\nplanners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in\nparticular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of\ntrying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner\nthat can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which\nplanning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm,\nFLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step\norderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to\neager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering\ncommitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using\na simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can\nvary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also\nduring the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel\ncontribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which\ncommitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to\ninvestigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient\nplanning strategies."

To overcome these drawbacks, we\npropose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of\nrepresentation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a\nrelated sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change\nof representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract.\nHowever, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the\nabstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of\nabstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction\napproach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated\nSystem), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned\nfrom given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning\nin mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed\nreasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning."

Nevertheless,\nfinding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is\nnot guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of\nsteps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used\nfor such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is\nfound in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate,\nis uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify\ntree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid\nlocal minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is\nguaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system\n(self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On\nthe negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm\nexists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous\nscheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while\na synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step.\nIn addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when\nthe scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be\nimproved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called\nactivate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance\nguarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset."

    "summary": "Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category\nlevel by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function.\nSuch systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership\nvalue'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of\ncombining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many\nprimitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A\nmembership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a\nprimitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions\nof a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the\nprimitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper,\nwe provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that\nautomatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects\nlabeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is\ngenerally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are\ncombined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership\nvalue."

    "summary": "This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive\ntutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a\nflexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an\ninstructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in\nwhatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the\nagent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of\ninstructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves\nsuch learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It\ncombines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each\ninstruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete\nexplanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar\nthat learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from\ninteractive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key\nrequirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous\nsystems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point;\n(2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to\na hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance,\nconditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class\nof knowledge it uses to perform tasks."

    "summary": "In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and\nthe usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently\nthere has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in\nmachine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform\ngeneralization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of\nimplication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique\nto compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under\nimplication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate\nfor learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is\nthe basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between\nclauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of\nimplication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show\nthat for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general\ngeneralization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce\ngeneralizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under\ntheta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover\nwe show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete\nexpansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the\nclause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion."

It has been shown that these two representations are\nincomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore\nnatural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these\nrepresentations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in\ndatabase theory, where it has applications to the design of relational\ndatabases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems.\nOur main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under\npolynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding\ndecision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given\nset of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression.\nWe also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well\nknown problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no\npolynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation\nproblems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a\nspecial case they are equivalent to it."

In this paper, we\ndiscuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal\nreasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for\nrepresenting temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for\ndetermining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding\none or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two\nimportant algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a\nbacktracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop\ntechniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly\noptimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable\nand value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously\nsuggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time\nand space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the\ntechniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems\nthat are of practical size."

In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in\nO(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the\nnetwork. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us\nto answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence\nabsorption.

Clustering\nsystems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality\nand the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the\nsearch strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but\nbe computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both\nways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs\na `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative\noptimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings.\nGiven this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial\nclusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative\noptimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search\nof a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative\noptimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been\nconstructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific\ncriteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic\nperformance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over\ncompleted patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this\nperformance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by\nsupervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical\nclusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we\npropose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures\nfor decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and\nsimplicity dimensions."

Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a\ncomputable least generalization under implication of every finite set of\nclauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among\nother, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a\nleast generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if\nboth the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are\nfunction-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and\nnon-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages."

    "summary": "This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a\ncomputer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers\nfamiliar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a\nbroad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the\nproblem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error\ninteractions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a\nresemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and\nin the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of\nreinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation,\nestablishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning\nfrom delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate\nlearning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden\nstate. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment\nof the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning."

    "summary": "A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no\nuncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions\nunder which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully\npredictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e.,\nplans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In\nthis paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and\nconstruction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order\ncontingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the\nagent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The\ndecision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are\nplanned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes\nthe process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The\nexplicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to\nthe problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions\nsuch as the use of different decision-making procedures."

We refer to such systems as partially controlled\nmulti-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of\nthe uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In\nparticular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in\nthese terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable\nagents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work\nacross different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies\nthe design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one\ncontext, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in\nthe other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for\ncontrolling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine\ntheir relationship."

    "summary": "Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the\nresearch in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems,\nnonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have\nidentified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning\norganizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that\nperceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure\nand behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to\nperform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical\nmethods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to\nunify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program\nwritten in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous\nfield and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level\ndescriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a\nmulti-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by\nforming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of\ngeneric operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to\nperform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and\nsuccessively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the\nneighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To\nillustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three\nimplemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the\nspatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of\ncommonly used routines."

The first two techniques are\naimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is\nbased on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to\nselect plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero\ncommitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO\nprioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator\nparameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from\nthe definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a\npolynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the\noperator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter\ndomains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove\nspurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP,\nour improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors\nranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial\nfor the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest\nimprovements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave\nspeedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the\ndefault UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for\nour techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices."

    "summary": "Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse\nstructure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than\nstructural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or\nsentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit\ndiscourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and\nplan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for\nclassifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning\nprograms (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets\nof pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine\nlearning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the\ngeneration of classification models, but also for improving upon previous\nresults. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the\nliterature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain\nnew linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to\nautomatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively\nanalyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.\nFinally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and\nflexible than manual methods."

    "summary": "This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation,\nthat is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain,\nwhich negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State\nOriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient\nconditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an\naltered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of\njoint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict\nresolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial\ncooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in\nfundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A\nUnified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types\nof encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a\npartial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents'\ngoals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational\nagreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where\nagents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents.\nFirst we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we\nanalyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase\ntheir utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and\ntherefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to\ntheir goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict',\nthe other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency\nof negotiation outcomes."

Such problems arise naturally in\nsignal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing,\nand handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to\nsegment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by\nthe segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent\nseveral similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple\ninstances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and\nconstraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP,\nreducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts\nof MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We\nthen demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically\nambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often\ngenerated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be\nused to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences.

A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a\nfactorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of\nconditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that\nenables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a\ncombination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain\nfactorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal\nindependence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given\nits parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as\n``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a\nsimple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a\nquery variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of\nthe query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal\nindependence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical\ndiagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and\nallows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms."

    "summary": "Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have\nbeen based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and\nsymbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or\nconnectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use\na relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic\ncomponent. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning\nrobust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a\nflat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for\nanalyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather\nthan using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist\nanalysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language\nprocessing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of\nconnectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the\nSCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In\nthis paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the\nflat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,\nand a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of\nnoisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat\nrepresentations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language\nthan deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the\nfault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a\nflat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an\noverall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework."

    "summary": "Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for\ndescribing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept)\nand relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is\nthe possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that\nprecisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point\nout that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition\ncontaining some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of\nchoosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a\nformalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation\nformalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In\naddition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers,\nand qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs\nto express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs\nenable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of\nrecursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc.\nWe establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the\ncomputational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a\nparticular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus."

    "summary": "We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks,\nwhich consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic\nexpression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple\nevaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a\nnumber, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the\nanswer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest.\nIt appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms\nfor exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using\nclustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a\nQ-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the\ninference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a\nstandard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended\nvalue of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to\nutilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed\nframework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different\nsoftware and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation\nalgorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes:\nsimple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex\noptimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning\nand computation-caching."

This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine\nthe topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting\ngeneralization, especially when given impoverished domain theories.

LCFR and ZLIFO make very\ndifferent, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to\nreduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing\nthat much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO\ncomponent of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show\nthat for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with\nthe delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size,\nand will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a\nstrategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain\ncharacteristics may reduce its effectiveness."

    "summary": "Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex,\ndynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as\neducation, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective\nrobotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains\nobstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter\ndiffering, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.\nFurthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities\nor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and\ncommunication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting\nindividual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their\ninflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their\ndomain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key\nto such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of\nteamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination\nand communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models\nenable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing\nconsistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,\ncalled STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions\n(Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a\n(partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel\nGrosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members\nmonitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team\nas necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM\nensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate\nsensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's\napplication in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical\nresults."

It replaces the detailed\nand lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous\nplanning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve\nperformance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance\nimprovements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem\nsimilarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning\neffort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP\ndepends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes\nthe design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner\nDERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating\nexplanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from\nthe retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine\njudgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision\nhas been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library,\nthrough the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as\nsingle goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller\ncases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this\napproach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval\nfailure."

    "summary": "The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete\ninformation against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general\nagent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state\n(controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function\nis initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a\nprior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his\nreward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action\nto every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are\nconsidered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able\nto observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the\nother -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is\nthe reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable\nprocesses, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result\nrefers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We\nprove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the\ncompetitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high\nprobability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It\nis further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect\nmonitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case\nthere does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run\noptimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove\nthat a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect\nmonitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to\nlong-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from\nprevious work in this area."

For quite a long\ntime, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was\na major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still\nwide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the\nproblem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this\nconjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic\napproach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically\nimproving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These\napproaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently\nproposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding.\nEmpirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that\nbidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with\nlimited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search\nappears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding\nunidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a\nsearch strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional\nheuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered."

In this\npaper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn\napproximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very\nefficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is\nrepresented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the\nupper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and\nsimilarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which\nenables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when\nthe underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn\nformula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for\nmore complex updates."

    "summary": "An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is\ntheir nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can\ninvalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that\ncan always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the\nconsequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae\nthat, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any\nformula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes\nof formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to\nthe formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering.\nWe will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic\ncharacterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the\nefficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics."

    "summary": "Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two\ncategories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent\napproaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very\nefficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be\n(re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the\ndomain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these\napproaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the\nknowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis\ntools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture\ncalled CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used\nto derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a\ndeclarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific\nto a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive\ndomain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative\ntheory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach\nby generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space\nrefinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform\nclassical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,\nKambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will\ncontrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional\nmethods for customizing domain independent planners."

Subject to certain\nassumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of\nthe number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero\nentries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the\nADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for\nthis structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically\ndemonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large\nreal-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates\nmemory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be\ndeduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near\nits leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net\nstructure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection\nalgorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree\nmethods against traditional direct counting approaches.

The\ntheory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the\ntheory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training\nexamples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions\nare made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is\nto determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching\nproblem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain\ntheories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of\ndetermining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of\nwhat revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining\nstability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that\nrevisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification\nof examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification\nof examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used\nto determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching\nalgorithms."

The main contribution of this paper is\nintegrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this\nproperty by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have\nbeen discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent\niterations of the windowing process.

Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence\nknown as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard\nvariations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in\nNNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure\ndoes not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF\nwhich can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show\na precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the\ntopology of the underlying system structure.

Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators.\nThe major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros\nthat are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the\nsearch space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro\nlearning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros.\nThis paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros.\nSolvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The\nonly macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local\nminimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several\ndomains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles.

DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based\non relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the\nscenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which\nguide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams\ninitiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes,\nand 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday\noccurrences.\n  The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four\ncontrol goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented:\nrationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role\nof episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed\ninformation is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of\nDAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running."

Over the last few years, there have been an\nincreasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or\ncollaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd\nPick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top\nof legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are\ncompletely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus,\ntheir framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react\nwhen the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In\nthis paper, we propose the concept of a \\emph{probabilistic agent program} and\nshow how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may\nbuild a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports\ndecision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative\nsemantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics,\nthough more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute.

For each logic, we introduce several\nsemantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs.\nOur results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic\nconstructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as\nmodal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for\ndefault logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic.\nThus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be\nviewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate,\nthe semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy\ndifferent locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result\nexplains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two\nsemantics.

    "summary": "Randomized algorithms for deciding satisfiability were shown to be effective\nin solving problems with thousands of variables. However, these algorithms are\nnot complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment,\nif one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there\nare two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time\nand, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a\nsatisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue\nthat without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for\nrandomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal\nnotion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use\nboth notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate\nthe dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as\nclause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We\ndemonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of\nvariables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for\nthe formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs."

    "summary": "Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and\nincoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a\nprivate syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent\nagents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy.\nWhen syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of\ndescription-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled.\nAt this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic\nmemory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with\nthe environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which\nenables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the\nsame syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from\ndynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent\ncomputation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also\nmentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial\nbiological code necessary open-ended evolution."

We\nspecify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive\nlogic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To\ncompute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down\nabductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule.

It forms a general high-level knowledge representation\nenvironment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas.\nIn ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial\nintegration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex\nproblems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language\nof ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver\nfor finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and\nscheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the\ndirect use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it\nis built.

The relevance relations are ternary (using\ncontext as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The\ninference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by\nmaintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers\nfrom a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between\nexplicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented\nformalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents."

For the sentential model of belief\nstates we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories\ndetermined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we\nintroduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for\nselecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort\ninvolved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we\ncharacterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility\nordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking\nof an arbitrary sentence in the language.

    "summary": "High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with\nprocesses which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where\nthe execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon\nas the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages\nare well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to\nprojecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are\nexecuted. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \\congolog,\nbased on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has\nproblems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these\nproblems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support\ncontinuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \\ccgolog, a\nvariant of \\congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One\nbenefit of \\ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to\nnon-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded\nprojection mechanism."

    "summary": "We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a\ntractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful\nlogical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also\npresented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into\nDNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity.\nWe present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered\nbinary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an\nequivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a\nsubclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the\nprevious complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this\nstricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a\nnew operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the\nassertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF\ntwice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the\nentailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF\nunder the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the\nsignificance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement\nlinear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete\nbelief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories."

    "summary": "Planning is a natural domain of application for frameworks of reasoning about\nactions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language\nE, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We\ndefine two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called\nthe E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe\nplan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for\ncases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based\nupon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural\nproof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this\nproof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts\nargumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We\nprovide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in\nparticular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known."

Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are\nexpressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a\nmaximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as\nconsistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a\nsingle language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended\nby K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state;\nalternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.\n  The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express\nother approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and\nthe incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework\ndiffers from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect\nto iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for\nimplementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results\nthan general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite\nknowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those\npropositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A."

    "summary": "Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming\nparadigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and\ncombinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with\nan intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints.\nHowever, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive\nclosure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large\ntheories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such\nproblems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as\nstable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently\nand, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their\nsemantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this\npaper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC.\nInformally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of\nHorn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of\nthe propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the\nsystem, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the\nsyntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an\nimplementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the\neffectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and\nSMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is\ncompetitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems,\noften yielding much more efficient solutions."

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning theory based on\nmulti-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is\ndistinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of\nneural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We\nshow how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a\nparallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing\nin that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model\nconverges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model\nadaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on\ngradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local\noptimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is\ndeveloped to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the\nCFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we\nprove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a\ncritical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule\nlearning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be\nextracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the\npractical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition\nand hepatitis prognosis prediction."

This can\nbe compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an\napproach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is\ngood if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is\ngood if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for\nproviding only a partially functional account of argument, and similar\ncriticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG)\ncommunity-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account\nof intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that\nalthough RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse\ndomains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal\ncontracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law\ncommunity exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract\nnegotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for\nexample Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to\nRST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text.

    "summary": "Much work in computer science has adopted competitive analysis as a tool for\ndecision making under uncertainty. In this work we extend competitive analysis\nto the context of multi-agent systems. Unlike classical competitive analysis\nwhere the behavior of an agent's environment is taken to be arbitrary, we\nconsider the case where an agent's environment consists of other agents. These\nagents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to\nthe definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of\nrational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis\nfor multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational\ncompetitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the\nclassical one-way trading problem."

The general notion of nonmonotonic\nreasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the\nproperty it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns\nof nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map\nthe field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We\nconcentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations,\ndefined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of\nview are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D.\nGabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families\nare defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two\npoints of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential\nrelations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The \"preferential\"\nmodels proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic\nsemantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional\nlogic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the\nstudy of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in\nthis paper will be treated in another paper."

This paper studies a more restricted class\nof consequence relations, \"rational\" relations. It is argued that any\nreasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation.\nIt is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be\nrepresented by a \"ranked\" preferential model, or by a (non-standard)\nprobabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is\ndefined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title.\nGlobal properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative\noperation.

An ordered\nlogic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique\nterms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form\ns < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a\nsecond, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected,\nin that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the\npreferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the\nspecification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily\nwithin a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a\nlogic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we\ndevelop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the\npreference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We\nthen demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing\nhow other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured\nwithin our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an\nextended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as\ndlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler\nas a front-end for these programming systems."

    "summary": "Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning.\nIn reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because\ndomain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general\ninertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also\ninterfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a\nprioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning\nabout action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\\cal AT}^{0},\n{\\cal AT}^{1} and {\\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in\naction domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and\nactions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a\nhigher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower\nsuperscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\\cal A}\nlanguage but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where\ntransition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By\nillustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a\npowerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and\npostdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action\nlanguages and characterize classes of action domains that present more\ndesirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action\nlanguages."

KR 2002) and answer set programming.\nLogic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective\ncalled ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent\nalternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A\n\\times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at\nleast B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a\npreference relation on answer sets.

We present a\ngeneral notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any\nequivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive\nresults are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified,\nshowing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as\ndifficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or\nrenamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the\ninference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and\nclausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred\nmodels of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time\npolynomial in the output size.

We investigate two main\nissues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together\ndifferent problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of\nactions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem\ndomain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its\ncomputational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this\nrepresentation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out\nthrough a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational\nperformance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare\ndifferent representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology\nof the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through\ndomain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of\ncomputational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological\nguidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried\nout within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the\nresults, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are\nindependent of the specific modeling language."

We\nstart by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to\npreference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then\nspecify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework\nfor preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded\nsemantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is\nconvinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our\nsemantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to\nvarious existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the\nweakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we\nindicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured\nwithin our semantical framework."

That is, the new formalisms properly generalize\ntheir counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than\nmodel-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than\nprobabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful\nespecially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning\non zero events.

Rather than stipulating that\nthe conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are\ntrue, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in\n``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This\n``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the\ninference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and\nprevious inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect\nknown frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default\ninference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an\nextension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise\nresult from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when\nconstrued in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default\nrules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics."

In\nthis paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge\nbases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an\nupdate policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update\napproaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of\nevolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational\nproperties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states\nwith respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds\non a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary\ncharacterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances,\nwhich can be exploited for obtaining decidability results.

The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit\nof acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an\noptimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used\nsolution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm,\nor various other methods using macro-actions.\n  Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of\nthe world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement\nlearning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple\nmodel, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model\nmakes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an\noptimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal.\nIn turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables\nfast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations."

Besides, there exist highly\nstochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from\nepisode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of\ntime. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g.,\nplanning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work,\nformulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the\nduration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple\nextension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as\nmethods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer\ndemonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle."

However,\nthese semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about\nwhich semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive\nwell-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an\nintuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming\nwhich can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to\ndefining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations,\nargumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide\na bottom-up procedure for this semantics.

Queries will be supported by arguments that could be\ndefeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A\nfor q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated\nby a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.\n  The defeasible argumentation basis of DeLP allows to build applications that\ndeal with incomplete and contradictory information in dynamic domains.

The\nunfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial\nstable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and\nmodular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial\nstable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models.\nDisjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now\nbecome available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case.\nSecondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be\ndetermined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an\nimplementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine\nfor implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is\ndemonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of\ndisjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine.

In cases\nwhere the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a\nseparate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem.\nAnother approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track\nonly the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis\ndensity (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the\nexpected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is\nkept, the model-data association problem is avoided.\n  The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD\nfilter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of\nmultiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show\nthat the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving\nnear-real-time performance."

S2 performs a heuristically guided search and\nreplicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both\nS1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles.\nWe then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results\nof S1 and S2, using the proposed framework.

In this apparatus, expected utility\nintervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest\nexpected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice\nwhen the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of\nanother, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals.\nThis is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the\nambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out\nas favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we\nmight sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among\nthe decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected\nutility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of\neach choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest\nexpected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of\nrho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not\nonly the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational\nchoices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus,\nan assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the\nvalue of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is\nsufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to\ndiscern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is\njustifiable."

    "summary": "Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in\n1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a\nfundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian\nnetworks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating\nstrategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this\npaper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete\nobservations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions\nabout the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with\nincomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a\nvacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and\nwe use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In\ngeneral, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior\nprobabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions.\nThis is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the\nincompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of\nclassification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads\nto a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian\nnetworks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for\nclassification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for\na class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the\nmore general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much\nharder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears\nto provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations,\nwhen no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified."

We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we\nprovide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm\nthat generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This\nsubstantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more\ngeneralized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing\nrelative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that\ncharacterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show\nthat there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives\nthe right results.

The\nrepresentation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D\norientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which\nwill handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and\nTA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational\ncomponents of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t\natoms will consist of those pairs <t,r> of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that\nare compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its\nrotation table and its composition tables.

    "summary": "An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its\nenvironment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to\nquantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the\nexpected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need\nto assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions.\nOf course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should\nbe based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one\napproach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that\ncan include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations,\nphysical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds\nmethod. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of\nthe worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to\nintegrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic\nreasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be\neasily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in\ndirect inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about\nindividuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of\nrandom worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of\nreasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant\ninformation, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the\nexpressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random\nworlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many\nother non-deductive reasoning systems."

This approach has strengths that complement those of languages based on the\nResource Description Framework (RDF) such as RDF Schema and DAML+OIL. The main\nbenefits of the ICMAUS approach are simplicity and comprehensibility in the\nrepresentation of ontologies, an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties\nin knowledge, and a versatile reasoning system with capabilities in the kinds\nof probabilistic reasoning that seem to be required in the Semantic Web."

    "summary": "Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be\ninferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a\nwell-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two\nattributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between\nseveral attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has\nbeen independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in\nvarious disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We\napply interaction information to visually present the most important\ninteractions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight\ninto the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant\nattributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering\nunexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of\npredictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine\nlearning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps:\nmyopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of\ninteractions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in\nspite of independence."

A natural application of this\nanalogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility\nvalues. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions\nbased on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps\nassign utility values based on partial preference information.

This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously\nanalyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant\nproblems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal\nmodel for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the\nabductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge\nrepresentation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive\nframework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from\ndifferent domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning;\ntheir encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We\nthoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in\nthe context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we\nimplement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the\nDLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with\npenalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this\napproach is sound and complete."

To overcome these\nlimitations, we further enhance the knowledge modelling abilities of \\DLP, by\nextending this language by {\\em Parametric Connectives (OR and AND)}.

    "summary": "We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based\ncalculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general,\nintegrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the\nqualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal\ndirection atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\\alpha ,\\beta)(x,y)$,\nwith $\\alpha ,\\beta\\in [0,2\\pi)$ and $(\\beta -\\alpha)\\in [0,\\pi ]$: the meaning\nof the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the\n(convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form\n$[r_1\\vee...\\vee r_{n_1}\\vee (\\alpha_1,\\beta_1)\\vee...\\vee (\\alpha\n_{n_2},\\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\\alpha\n_i,\\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above:\nthe meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$,\n$r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\\alpha_i,\\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A\nconjunction of such general constraints is a $\\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will\nrefer to as an $\\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective\nsolution search algorithm for an $\\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1)\nconstraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the\nfiltering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing\ncompleteness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly\nsuited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like\nsurveillance of a geographic area."

In this paper, we show that computed answers can\nalways be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures\nthat we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation. We present some\nexperimental results on an encoding of the logistics domain."

    "summary": "The field of machine learning (ML) is concerned with the question of how to\nconstruct algorithms that automatically improve with experience. In recent\nyears many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining\nprograms, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the\ndetection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of\nproblems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they\nrely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.\n  In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting\nto formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined\nwith other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning\ntheory.\n  In this paper we outline different alternatives for combining defeasible\nargumentation and machine learning techniques. We suggest how different aspects\nof a generic argument-based framework can be integrated with other ML-based\napproaches."

This approach relies mainly on the closed\nworld assumption to complete the available knowledge and its formulation has\nits basis in the so-called Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation.\n  The primary goal of this work is to present an alternative and\nepistemic-based characterization of stable model semantics, to the\nGelfond-Lifschitz transformation. In particular, we show that stable model\nsemantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene\nsemantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an\nadditional source of `falsehood' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene\nsemantics. Our approach is purely algebraic and can abstract from the\nparticular formalism of choice as it is based on monotone operators (under the\nknowledge order) over bilattices only."

This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for\nintegrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of\ndifferent hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC\nsystems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end."

In\ngeneral, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature\nexhibiting what is known as the butterfly effect. While some regions of the\nworld are noticing a systematic decrease in annual rainfall, others notice\nincreases in flooding and severe storms. The global nature of this phenomenon\nis very complicated and requires sophisticated computer modeling and simulation\nto predict accurately. In this paper, we report a performance analysis for\nMultivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)and artificial neural networks\nfor one month ahead prediction of rainfall. To evaluate the prediction\nefficiency, we made use of 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the\nsouthern part of the Indian peninsula situated at latitude -longitude pairs\n(8o29'N - 76o57' E). We used an artificial neural network trained using the\nscaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The neural network and MARS were trained\nwith 40 years of rainfall data. For performance evaluation, network predicted\noutputs were compared with the actual rainfall data. Simulation results reveal\nthat MARS is a good forecasting tool and performed better than the considered\nneural network."

    "summary": "In a universe with a single currency, there would be no foreign exchange\nmarket, no foreign exchange rates, and no foreign exchange. Over the past\ntwenty-five years, the way the market has performed those tasks has changed\nenormously. The need for intelligent monitoring systems has become a necessity\nto keep track of the complex forex market. The vast currency market is a\nforeign concept to the average individual. However, once it is broken down into\nsimple terms, the average individual can begin to understand the foreign\nexchange market and use it as a financial instrument for future investing. In\nthis paper, we attempt to compare the performance of hybrid soft computing and\nhard computing techniques to predict the average monthly forex rates one month\nahead. The soft computing models considered are a neural network trained by the\nscaled conjugate gradient algorithm and a neuro-fuzzy model implementing a\nTakagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. We also considered Multivariate Adaptive\nRegression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a\nhybrid CART-MARS technique. We considered the exchange rates of Australian\ndollar with respect to US dollar, Singapore dollar, New Zealand dollar,\nJapanese yen and United Kingdom pounds. The models were trained using 70% of\nthe data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. It is\nobserved that the proposed hybrid models could predict the forex rates more\naccurately than all the techniques when applied individually. Empirical results\nalso reveal that the hybrid hard computing approach also improved some of our\nprevious work using a neuro-fuzzy approach."

Due to intense competition on one hand and the customer's\noption to choose from several alternatives business community has realized the\nnecessity of intelligent marketing strategies and relationship management. Web\nusage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data\nobtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has\nbecome very critical for effective Web site management, creating adaptive Web\nsites, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow\nanalysis and so on. In this paper, we present the important concepts of Web\nusage mining and its various practical applications. We further present a novel\napproach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) to optimize the concurrent architecture\nof a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover web data clusters) and a fuzzy\ninference system to analyze the Web site visitor trends. A hybrid evolutionary\nfuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate\nsimilar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends\nusing a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of\nevolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Proposed approach is\ncompared with self-organizing maps (to discover patterns) and several function\napproximation techniques like neural networks, linear genetic programming and\nTakagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (to analyze the clusters).

To illustrate what we have in mind a machine\nlanguage routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The\nroutine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors.

First\nwe present a tuning of DBS that visits the same search nodes as IB, but avoids\nrestarts. Then we compare both theoretically and computationally DBS and LDS\nusing the same heuristic. We prove that DBS has a higher probability of being\nsuccessful than LDS on a comparable number of nodes, under realistic\nassumptions.

The core of FLUX is a system of Constraint Handling Rules, which\nenables agents to maintain an internal model of their environment by which they\ncontrol their own behavior. The general action representation formalism of the\nfluent calculus provides the formal semantics for the constraint solver. FLUX\nexhibits excellent computational behavior due to both a carefully restricted\nexpressiveness and the inference paradigm of progression."

In this paper we\npropose a Cauchy annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection scheme based on a\nhypothesis that selection-strength should increase as evolutionary process goes\non and distance between two selection strengths should decrease for the process\nto converge. To formalize these aspects, we develop formalism for selection\nmechanisms using fitness distributions and give an appropriate measure for\nselection-strength. In this paper, we prove an important result, by which we\nderive an annealing schedule called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate\nthe novelty of proposed annealing schedule using simulations in the framework\nof genetic algorithms."

From PCR1 to PCR2, PCR3, PCR4, PCR5 one increases the complexity of\nthe rules and also the exactitude of the redistribution of conflicting masses.\nPCR1 restricted from the hyper-power set to the power set and without\ndegenerate cases gives the same result as the Weighted Average Operator (WAO)\nproposed recently by J{\\o}sang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe but does not satisfy\nthe neutrality property of vacuous belief assignment. That's why improved PCR\nrules are proposed in this paper. PCR4 is an improvement of minC and Dempster's\nrules. The PCR rules redistribute the conflicting mass, after the conjunctive\nrule has been applied, proportionally with some functions depending on the\nmasses assigned to their corresponding columns in the mass matrix. There are\ninfinitely many ways these functions (weighting factors) can be chosen\ndepending on the complexity one wants to deal with in specific applications and\nfusion systems. Any fusion combination rule is at some degree ad-hoc."

    "summary": "Normal forms for logic programs under stable/answer set semantics are\nintroduced. We argue that these forms can simplify the study of program\nproperties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the {\\em kernel}\nof the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A\nkernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded\nsemantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets.\nThe body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form\ntends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is\npossible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the\nExtended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed.\nThe second normal form is called {\\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed\nof the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in\n3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to\na cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have\npositive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static\nanalysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of\nexistence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel\ngraph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in\nthe companion article \\cite{Cos04b}."

If the table is to be\npopulated through knowledge elicited from a domain expert then the sheer\nmagnitude of the task forms a considerable cognitive barrier. In this paper we\ndevise an algorithm to populate the CPT while easing the extent of knowledge\nacquisition. The input to the algorithm consists of a set of weights that\nquantify the relative strengths of the influences of the parent-nodes on the\nchild-node, and a set of probability distributions the number of which grows\nonly linearly with the number of associated parent-nodes. These are elicited\nfrom the domain expert. The set of probabilities are obtained by taking into\nconsideration the heuristics that experts use while arriving at probabilistic\nestimations. The algorithm is used to populate the CPT by computing appropriate\nweighted sums of the elicited distributions. We invoke the methods of\ninformation geometry to demonstrate how these weighted sums capture the\nexpert's judgemental strategy."

    "summary": "Consider the problem of tracking a set of moving targets. Apart from the\ntracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either\nto steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator\nabout the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality\nmeasure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated\nobservations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could\nbe the Kullback-Leibler difference.\n  We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some\nterrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and \"meta-sensors\"\nwith force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different\nsize. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle\nfilters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their\nsub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of\nthose sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.\n  Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior\nPHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to\nthree or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a\nmapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on\ndoctrine knowledge of unit configuration.\n  The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using\nsome measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a\nbounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a\ndiscretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the\nmeasure locally to different parts of the space."

In this case, it is sometimes necessary to pre-process reports before\nsending them to tracking modules in the fusion system. The pre-processing step\nassociates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on\nobjects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process\nstep before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.\n  The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original\nproblem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The\napproximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are\nnecessary to compute. To determine this, results on phase-transitions occurring\nwhen coloring (or clustering) large random instances of a particular graph\nensemble are used."

    "summary": "Answer set programming (ASP) with disjunction offers a powerful tool for\ndeclaratively representing and solving hard problems. Many NP-complete problems\ncan be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise\nand intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical \"guess and check\"\nnature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial\nsize certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the\nproblem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond\nNP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial\nhierarchy. While these problems also have a clear \"guess and check\" structure,\nfinding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a\nnon-obvious task, in particular if the \"check\" itself is a coNP-complete\nproblem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and\ncheck programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check\nprogram. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free\n(extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended)\ndisjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer\nsets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence,\nand, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a\ndesignated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations\nfacilitate the integration of separate \"guess\" and \"check\" programs, which are\noften easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program.\nOur results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend\nmethods and techniques for a declarative \"guess and check\" problem solving\nparadigm through ASP."

Section 3\nintroduces an evolving cascade neural network technique which adds new input\nnodes as well as new neurons to the network while the training error decreases.\nThis algorithm is applied to recognize artifacts in the clinical EEGs. Section\n4 presents the GMDH-type polynomial networks learnt from data. We applied this\ntechnique to distinguish the EEGs recorded from an Alzheimer and a healthy\npatient as well as recognize EEG artifacts. Section 5 describes the new\nneural-network technique developed to induce multi-class concepts from data. We\nused this technique for inducing a 16-class concept from the large-scale\nclinical EEG data. Finally we discuss perspectives of applying the\nneural-network techniques to clinical EEGs."

The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off\nbetween the amount of data available for training, the diversity of a\nclassifier ensemble and the required performance. The interpretability of\nclassification models can also give useful information for experts responsible\nfor making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem\nto be attractive classification models. The required diversity of the DT\nensemble can be achieved by using the Bayesian model averaging all possible\nDTs. In practice, the Bayesian approach can be implemented on the base of a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of random sampling from the posterior\ndistribution. For sampling large DTs, the MCMC method is extended by Reversible\nJump technique which allows inducing DTs under given priors. For the case when\nthe prior information on the DT size is unavailable, the sweeping technique\ndefining the prior implicitly reveals a better performance. Within this Chapter\nwe explore the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian MCMC techniques on\nsome datasets from the StatLog Repository and real financial data. The\nclassification uncertainty is compared within an Uncertainty Envelope technique\ndealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence\nprobability. This technique provides realistic estimates of the classification\nuncertainty which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms with the aim\nof risk evaluation."

These models are\ncapable to map sequences of data into a Markov chain in which the transitions\nbetween the states depend on the \\texttt{n} previous states according to the\norder of the model. We study the process of achieving information extraction\nfromspatial and temporal data by means of an unsupervised classification. We\nuse therefore a French national database related to the land use of a region,\nnamed Teruti, which describes the land use both in the spatial and temporal\ndomain. Land-use categories (wheat, corn, forest, ...) are logged every year on\neach site regularly spaced in the region. They constitute a temporal sequence\nof images in which we look for spatial and temporal dependencies. The temporal\nsegmentation of the data is done by means of a second-order Hidden Markov Model\n(\\hmmd) that appears to have very good capabilities to locate stationary\nsegments, as shown in our previous work in speech recognition. Thespatial\nclassification is performed by defining a fractal scanning ofthe images with\nthe help of a Hilbert-Peano curve that introduces atotal order on the sites,\npreserving the relation ofneighborhood between the sites. We show that the\n\\hmmd performs aclassification that is meaningful for the agronomists.Spatial\nand temporal classification may be achieved simultaneously by means of a 2\nlevels \\hmmd that measures the \\aposteriori probability to map a temporal\nsequence of images onto a set of hidden classes."

In this\narticle, our presentation of OntoKADS will focus on the core ontology and, in\nparticular, on roles - the primitive situated at the interface between domain\nknowledge and reasoning, and whose ontological status is still much debated. We\nfirst propose a coherent, global, ontological framework which enables us to\naccount for this primitive.

    "summary": "Clustering is a widely used technique in data mining applications for\ndiscovering patterns in underlying data. Most traditional clustering algorithms\nare limited to handling datasets that contain either numeric or categorical\nattributes. However, datasets with mixed types of attributes are common in real\nlife data mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndivide-and-conquer technique to solve this problem. First, the original mixed\ndataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the\npure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms\ndesigned for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding\nclusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset\nare combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering\nalgorithm is used to get the final clusters. Our contribution in this paper is\nto provide an algorithm framework for the mixed attributes clustering problem,\nin which existing clustering algorithms can be easily integrated, the\ncapabilities of different kinds of clustering algorithms and characteristics of\ndifferent types of datasets could be fully exploited. Comparisons with other\nclustering algorithms on real life datasets illustrate the superiority of our\napproach."

    "summary": "An agent often has a number of hypotheses, and must choose among them based\non observations, or outcomes of experiments. Each of these observations can be\nviewed as providing evidence for or against various hypotheses. All the\nattempts to formalize this intuition up to now have assumed that associated\nwith each hypothesis h there is a likelihood function \\mu_h, which is a\nprobability measure that intuitively describes how likely each observation is,\nconditional on h being the correct hypothesis. We consider an extension of this\nframework where there is uncertainty as to which of a number of likelihood\nfunctions is appropriate, and discuss how one formal approach to defining\nevidence, which views evidence as a function from priors to posteriors, can be\ngeneralized to accommodate this uncertainty."

Indeed, human experts are today able\nto extract from this signal many hints related to physiological as well as\ncognitive states of the recorded subject and it would be very interesting to\nperform such task automatically but today no completely automatic system\nexists. In previous studies, we have compared human expertise and automatic\nprocessing tools, including artificial neural networks (ANN), to better\nunderstand the competences of each and determine which are the difficult\naspects to integrate in a fully automatic system. In this paper, we bring more\nelements to that study in reporting the main results of a practical experiment\nwhich was carried out in an hospital for sleep pathology study.

We describe a permutation-based evolutionary\nalgorithm that relies on a semi-greedy heuristic to gradually reconstruct the\nschedule by inserting trains one after the other following the permutation.\nThis algorithm can be hybridised with ILOG commercial MIP programming tool\nCPLEX in a coarse-grained manner: the evolutionary part is used to quickly\nobtain a good but suboptimal solution and this intermediate solution is refined\nusing CPLEX. Experimental results are presented on a large real-world case\ninvolving more than one million variables and 2 million constraints. Results\nare surprisingly good as the evolutionary algorithm, alone or hybridised,\nproduces excellent solutions much faster than CPLEX alone."

    "summary": "A fuzzy controller is usually designed by formulating the knowledge of a\nhuman expert into a set of linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Among the most\nsuccessful methods to automate the fuzzy controllers development process are\nevolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi\n(RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It is an extension\nof the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application\ndomain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy\ncontrollers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with\nsynergistic rules, fulfilling the $\\epsilon$-completeness property and\nproviding a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed\nrepresentation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units\nthat provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act\nas memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be\nspecified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the\nrules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution.\nThe representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area\nof system identification and evolutionary robotics."

    "summary": "When solving numerical constraints such as nonlinear equations and\ninequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant\nvalue combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the\ncomplete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with\nbranching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the\nso-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for\nsolving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that\nuses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection\nsearch. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions\nare isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums\nof solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper,\nwe propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants,\nwhich not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case,\nbut also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These\nnew search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the\nconstruction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our\nexperiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by\none order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of\nsolutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the\nsolutions are isolated."

While\nrecent years have brought enormous progress in various areas of statistical\ncomputing and clustering, some general challenges in clustering remain: model\nselection, robustness, and scalability to large datasets. We consider the\nimportant problem of deciding on the optimal number of clusters, given an\narbitrary definition of space and clusteriness. We show how to construct a\ncluster information criterion that allows objective model selection. Differing\nfrom other approaches, our truecluster method does not require specific\nassumptions about underlying distributions, dissimilarity definitions or\ncluster models. Truecluster puts arbitrary clustering algorithms into a generic\nunified (sampling-based) statistical framework. It is scalable to big datasets\nand provides robust cluster assignments and case-wise diagnostics. Truecluster\nwill make clustering more objective, allows for automation, and will save time\nand costs. Free R software is available."

Many such problems arising from the commercial world are\npermeated by data uncertainty. Existing CP approaches that accommodate\nuncertainty are less suited to uncertainty arising due to incomplete and\nerroneous data, because they do not build reliable models and solutions\nguaranteed to address the user's genuine problem as she perceives it. Other\nfields such as reliable computation offer combinations of models and associated\nmethods to handle these types of uncertain data, but lack an expressive\nframework characterising the resolution methodology independently of the model.\n  We present a unifying framework that extends the CP formalism in both model\nand solutions, to tackle ill-defined combinatorial problems with incomplete or\nerroneous data. The certainty closure framework brings together modelling and\nsolving methodologies from different fields into the CP paradigm to provide\nreliable and efficient approches for uncertain constraint problems. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the framework on a case study in network\ndiagnosis. We define resolution forms that give generic templates, and their\nassociated operational semantics, to derive practical solution methods for\nreliable solutions."

We define a fixed point logic (FPL) extension of Clark's completion\nsuch that open answer sets correspond to models of FPL formulas and identify a\nsyntactic subclass of programs, called (loosely) guarded programs. Whereas\nreasoning with general programs in OASP is undecidable, the FPL translation of\n(loosely) guarded programs falls in the decidable (loosely) guarded fixed point\nlogic (mu(L)GF). Moreover, we reduce normal closed ASP to loosely guarded OASP,\nenabling for the first time, a characterization of an answer set semantics by\nmuLGF formulas. We further extend the open answer set semantics for programs\nwith generalized literals. Such generalized programs (gPs) have interesting\nproperties, e.g., the ability to express infinity axioms. We restrict the\nsyntax of gPs such that both rules and generalized literals are guarded. Via a\ntranslation to guarded fixed point logic, we deduce 2-exptime-completeness of\nsatisfiability checking in such guarded gPs (GgPs). Bound GgPs are restricted\nGgPs with exptime-complete satisfiability checking, but still sufficiently\nexpressive to optimally simulate computation tree logic (CTL).

In this contribution, we discuss the estimation of the model when\nconfounding latent variables are present.

Processes of learning were divided into two types: strong and weak\nprocesses taking place in the absence and the presence of aprioristic\ninformation about an object respectively. Weak learning is synonymous to\nadaptation when aprioristic programs already available in a system (an\norganism) are started.

Repeated measurements are necessary in this case to reduce the error\nduring decision making."

    "summary": "Fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet is a set of numbers or symbols, are a\nformal model of computing with values. Motivated by Zadeh's paradigm of\ncomputing with words rather than numbers, Ying proposed a kind of fuzzy\nautomata, whose input alphabet consists of all fuzzy subsets of a set of\nsymbols, as a formal model of computing with all words. In this paper, we\nintroduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special)\nwords. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises\nsome (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy\ntransition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology\nof fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words\nto computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension\nprinciple from computing with words to computing with all words for handling\nfuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing\nwith all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words. Some\nalgebraic properties of retractions and generalized extensions are addressed as\nwell."

    "summary": "Through the Internet and the World-Wide Web, a vast number of information\nsources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by\ndifferent providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and\nmethods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One\nissue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query\nanswering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this\nproblem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources\n(prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user\nquery. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of\nthe information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a\nformal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as\nwell). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a\nquery description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection\nprograms, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured\nnature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must\ncarefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and\nfurthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype\nimplementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system\nand its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative\nexample involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental\nresults."

    "summary": "Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to\ndeal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of\nefficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of\ncomputational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main\nproblem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of\nrandom variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In\nthis paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in\norder to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach\napproximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive\ndiscretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the\nprobability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the\ndiscretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation\nin term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the\nability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading\nto a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an\nanytime representation of the distribution."

More specifically: (1) We formalize the\ndefinition of diagnosability for FDESs, in which the observable set and failure\nset of events are {\\it fuzzy}, that is, each event has certain degree to be\nobservable and unobservable, and, also, each event may possess different\npossibility of failure occurring. (2) Through the construction of\nobservability-based diagnosers of FDESs, we investigate its some basic\nproperties. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for\ndiagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the\napplications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described. To conclude, some\nrelated issues are raised for further consideration."

In Subjective Logic\nbeliefs are expressed as belief mass distribution functions over binary frames\nof discernment. Belief representations in Subjective Logic, which are called\nopinions, also contain a base rate parameter which express the a priori belief\nin the absence of evidence. Philosophically, beliefs are quantitative\nrepresentations of evidence as perceived by humans or by other intelligent\nagents. The basic operators of classical probability calculus, such as addition\nand multiplication, can be applied to opinions, thereby making belief calculus\npractical.

In this paper we present\na generalisation of the consensus operator that can be applied to Dirichlet\nbelief functions on state spaces of arbitrary size.

    "summary": "We present a state-based regression function for planning domains where an\nagent does not have complete information and may have sensing actions. We\nconsider binary domains and employ a three-valued characterization of domains\nwith sensing actions to define the regression function. We prove the soundness\nand completeness of our regression formulation with respect to the definition\nof progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through\nregression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that\nplanning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using\nregression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one."

In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern\nchess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to\nthose used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out\nanalysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one\ncompiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games.

In this paper, we propose an approach to {\\it\ndecentralized} failure diagnosis of SDESs, where the stochastic system uses\nmultiple local diagnosers to detect failures and each local diagnoser possesses\nits own information. In a way, the centralized failure diagnosis of SDESs can\nbe viewed as a special case of the decentralized failure diagnosis presented in\nthis paper with only one projection. The main contributions are as follows: (1)\nWe formalize the notion of codiagnosability for stochastic automata, which\nmeans that a failure can be detected by at least one local stochastic diagnoser\nwithin a finite delay. (2) We construct a codiagnoser from a given stochastic\nautomaton with multiple projections, and the codiagnoser associated with the\nlocal diagnosers is used to test codiagnosability condition of SDESs. (3) We\ndeal with a number of basic properties of the codiagnoser. In particular, a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the codiagnosability of SDESs is\npresented. (4) We give a computing method in detail to check whether\ncodiagnosability is violated. And (5) some examples are described to illustrate\nthe applications of the codiagnosability and its computing method."

DSmT is a new paradigm shift for\ninformation fusion and recent publications have shown the interest and the\npotential ability of DSmT to solve fusion problems where Dempster's rule used\nin Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides counter-intuitive results or fails to\nprovide useful result at all. This paper is focused on the foundations of DSmT\nand on its main rules of combination (classic, hybrid and Proportional Conflict\nRedistribution rules). Shafer's model on which is based DST appears as a\nparticular and specific case of DSm hybrid model which can be easily handled by\nDSmT as well. Several simple but illustrative examples are given throughout\nthis paper to show the interest and the generality of this new theory."

    "summary": "A fuzzy logic based classification engine has been developed for classifying\nmass spectra obtained with an imaging internal source Fourier transform mass\nspectrometer (I^2LD-FTMS). Traditionally, an operator uses the relative\nabundance of ions with specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios to categorize\nspectra. An operator does this by comparing the spectrum of m/z versus\nabundance of an unknown sample against a library of spectra from known samples.\nAutomated positioning and acquisition allow I^2LD-FTMS to acquire data from\nvery large grids, this would require classification of up to 3600 spectrum per\nhour to keep pace with the acquisition. The tedious job of classifying numerous\nspectra generated in an I^2LD-FTMS imaging application can be replaced by a\nfuzzy rule base if the cues an operator uses can be encapsulated. We present\nthe translation of linguistic rules to a fuzzy classifier for mineral phases in\nbasalt. This paper also describes a method for gathering statistics on ions,\nwhich are not currently used in the rule base, but which may be candidates for\nmaking the rule base more accurate and complete or to form new rule bases based\non data obtained from known samples. A spatial method for classifying spectra\nwith low membership values, based on neighboring sample classifications, is\nalso presented."

They allow reasoning about individuals and concepts, i.e.\nset of individuals with common properties. Typically, DLs are limited to\ndealing with crisp, well defined concepts. That is, concepts for which the\nproblem whether an individual is an instance of it is yes/no question. More\noften than not, the concepts encountered in the real world do not have a\nprecisely defined criteria of membership: we may say that an individual is an\ninstance of a concept only to a certain degree, depending on the individual's\nproperties. The DLs that deal with such fuzzy concepts are called fuzzy DLs. In\norder to deal with fuzzy, incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent concepts,\nwe need to extend the fuzzy DLs, combining the neutrosophic logic with a\nclassical DL. In particular, concepts become neutrosophic (here neutrosophic\nmeans fuzzy, incomplete, indeterminate, and inconsistent), thus reasoning about\nneutrosophic concepts is supported. We'll define its syntax, its semantics, and\ndescribe its properties."

    "summary": "A product configurator which is complete, backtrack free and able to compute\nthe valid domains at any state of the configuration can be constructed by\nbuilding a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). Despite the fact that the size of the\nBDD is exponential in the number of variables in the worst case, BDDs have\nproved to work very well in practice. Current BDD-based techniques can only\nhandle interactive configuration with small finite domains. In this paper we\nextend the approach to handle string variables constrained by regular\nexpressions. The user is allowed to change the strings by adding letters at the\nend of the string. We show how to make a data structure that can perform fast\nvalid domain computations given some assignment on the set of string variables.\n  We first show how to do this by using one large DFA. Since this approach is\ntoo space consuming to be of practical use, we construct a data structure that\nsimulates the large DFA and in most practical cases are much more space\nefficient. As an example a configuration problem on $n$ string variables with\nonly one solution in which each string variable is assigned to a value of\nlength of $k$ the former structure will use $\\Omega(k^n)$ space whereas the\nlatter only need $O(kn)$. We also show how this framework easily can be\ncombined with the recent BDD techniques to allow both boolean, integer and\nstring variables in the configuration problem."

    "summary": "Recently, M. Chertkov and V.Y. Chernyak derived an exact expression for the\npartition sum (normalization constant) corresponding to a graphical model,\nwhich is an expansion around the Belief Propagation solution. By adding\ncorrection terms to the BP free energy, one for each \"generalized loop\" in the\nfactor graph, the exact partition sum is obtained. However, the usually\nenormous number of generalized loops generally prohibits summation over all\ncorrection terms. In this article we introduce Truncated Loop Series BP\n(TLSBP), a particular way of truncating the loop series of M. Chertkov and V.Y.\nChernyak by considering generalized loops as compositions of simple loops. We\nanalyze the performance of TLSBP in different scenarios, including the Ising\nmodel, regular random graphs and on Promedas, a large probabilistic medical\ndiagnostic system. We show that TLSBP often improves upon the accuracy of the\nBP solution, at the expense of increased computation time. We also show that\nthe performance of TLSBP strongly depends on the degree of interaction between\nthe variables. For weak interactions, truncating the series leads to\nsignificant improvements, whereas for strong interactions it can be\nineffective, even if a high number of terms is considered."

    "summary": "In Verification and in (optimal) AI Planning, a successful method is to\nformulate the application as boolean satisfiability (SAT), and solve it with\nstate-of-the-art DPLL-based procedures. There is a lack of understanding of why\nthis works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of\nproblem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the\ncost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of\nstructure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0\nand 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International\nPlanning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of\nSAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted\nsynthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and\nthat are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search\nspace. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure.\nThe CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the\nlength of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the\nbest possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of\nstructure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of\nbranching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential\nlower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of\nvariables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations\n(and backdoors), showing a doubly exponential gap between the two structural\nextreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments --\nilluminate the prototypical patterns of structure causing the empirical\nbehavior observed in the competition benchmarks."

A wide variety of\nspecialized global constraints provide critical assistance in achieving a good\nmodel that can take advantage of the structure of the problem in the search for\na solution. However, a key outstanding issue is the representation of 'ad-hoc'\nconstraints that do not have an inherent combinatorial nature, and hence are\nnot modeled well using narrowly specialized global constraints. We attempt to\naddress this issue by considering a hybrid of search and compilation.\nSpecifically we suggest the use of Reduced Ordered Multi-Valued Decision\nDiagrams (ROMDDs) as the supporting data structure for a generic global\nconstraint. We give an algorithm for maintaining generalized arc consistency\n(GAC) on this constraint that amortizes the cost of the GAC computation over a\nroot-to-leaf path in the search tree without requiring asymptotically more\nspace than used for the MDD. Furthermore we present an approach for\nincrementally maintaining the reduced property of the MDD during the search,\nand show how this can be used for providing domain entailment detection.\nFinally we discuss how to apply our approach to other similar data structures\nsuch as AOMDDs and Case DAGs. The technique used can be seen as an extension of\nthe GAC algorithm for the regular language constraint on finite length input."

Introducing logics would\nbe a great improvement, and we propose in this paper, means for deciding -a\npriori- if one application can benefit from a complete revision, under only the\nassumption of a conjecture that we name the \"containment conjecture\", which\nlimits the size of the minimal conflicts to revise. We demonstrate that this\nconjecture brings us the interesting computational property of performing a\nnot-provable but global, revision, made of many local revisions, at a tractable\nsize.

We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm\nand tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information\nwhile training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.\nEach pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein\naccording to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used\nwere primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.\nHMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP\ndatabase to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out\ncross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult\nstructural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two\nsets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted\nmodels against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,\nwe compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method\nperformance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess\nsignificance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant\nperformance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default\nHMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over\nboth the original model and the structurally weighted models."

With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its\nopponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is\noften viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective\nstatistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to\ncontinuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to\nbe able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call\neach others bluffs in free, competitive play."

    "summary": "An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting\nor imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for\nonline operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online\ncondition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification\nand regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for\nclassification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the\nregression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are\ncompared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural\nnetworks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform\nup to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed\ntechnique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the\ndata, and hence, saves time."

    "summary": "Militarised conflict is one of the risks that have a significant impact on\nsociety. Militarised Interstate Dispute (MID) is defined as an outcome of\ninterstate interactions, which result on either peace or conflict. Effective\nprediction of the possibility of conflict between states is an important\ndecision support tool for policy makers. In a previous research, neural\nnetworks (NNs) have been implemented to predict the MID. Support Vector\nMachines (SVMs) have proven to be very good prediction techniques and are\nintroduced for the prediction of MIDs in this study and compared to neural\nnetworks. The results show that SVMs predict MID better than NNs while NNs give\nmore consistent and easy to interpret sensitivity analysis than SVMs."

The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange \"chemicals\" with their\nneighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a cell\nproduces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype,\nare controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the\nchemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the\nproposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not\npre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the\ngrowth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are\ndeclared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT\nalgorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural\nNetworks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors,\nthe experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the\nphenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a\ndirect regression approach using the same model with global information.\nMoreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect\nself-healing characteristics."

When the ANN is trained by a part of\nthe ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural\nsystem well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems may be\npredicted in case of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthquake to\noccur for the lessons. Time period and the corresponding maximum response of\nthe building for an earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to\npredict the maximum response of the building at different time periods. The\ntrained time period versus maximum response ANN model is also tested for real\nearthquake data of other place, which was not used in the training and was\nfound to be in good agreement."

The calculation of Pseudomodal\nEnergies, for the purposes of condition monitoring, has previously been found\nto be an accurate method of extracting features from vibration signals. This\ncalculation is therefore used to extract features from vibration signals\nobtained from a diverse population of cylindrical shells. Some of the cylinders\nin the population have faults in different substructures. The pseudomodal\nenergies calculated from the vibration signals are then used as inputs to a\nneuro-fuzzy model. A leave-one-out cross-validation process is used to test the\nperformance of the model.

    "summary": "Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering\ncontexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The\nclassic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster\nsolutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,\nwe present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best\nexplained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the\ncluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this\ncrosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest\ncounts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into\naccount the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to\nbreak ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The\ntruematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster\nframework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that\nthe truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal\ncluster sizes. Free R software is available."

Lots of models have been\nproposed in the litterature for representing such temporal information. All\nderive from a point-based or an interval-based framework. One fundamental\nreasoning task that arises in applications of these frameworks is given by the\nfollowing scheme: given possibly indefinite and incomplete knowledge of the\nbinary relationships between some temporal objects, find the consistent\nscenarii between all these objects. All these models require transitive tables\n-- or similarly inference rules-- for solving such tasks. We have defined an\nalternative model, S-languages - to represent qualitative temporal information,\nbased on the only two relations of \\emph{precedence} and \\emph{simultaneity}.\nIn this paper, we show how this model enables to avoid transitive tables or\ninference rules to handle this kind of problem."

    "summary": "Web semantic access in specific domains calls for specialized search engines\nwith enhanced semantic querying and indexing capacities, which pertain both to\ninformation retrieval (IR) and to information extraction (IE). A rich\nlinguistic analysis is required either to identify the relevant semantic units\nto index and weight them according to linguistic specific statistical\ndistribution, or as the basis of an information extraction process. Recent\ndevelopments make Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques reliable enough\nto process large collections of documents and to enrich them with semantic\nannotations. This paper focuses on the design and the development of a text\nprocessing platform, Ogmios, which has been developed in the ALVIS project. The\nOgmios platform exploits existing NLP modules and resources, which may be tuned\nto specific domains and produces linguistically annotated documents. We show\nhow the three constraints of genericity, domain semantic awareness and\nperformance can be handled all together."

This is a problem\nof very high complexity (NEXP-hard in n >= 2). In this paper, we propose a new\nmathematical programming approach for the problem. Our approach is based on two\nideas: First, we represent each agent's policy in the sequence-form and not in\nthe tree-form, thereby obtaining a very compact representation of the set of\njoint-policies. Second, using this compact representation, we solve this\nproblem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a\nmixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly\nyields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience\nshows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to\nsolve benchmark Dec-Pomdp problems than existing algorithms. For example, the\nmulti-agent tiger problem for horizon 4 is solved in 72 secs with the MILP\nwhereas existing algorithms require several hours to solve it."

Second, the recent\nintroduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network\ndatabases) allows semantic network models on the order of $10^9$ edges to be\nefficiently stored and manipulated.

In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative\nand/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators\n(addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed\nand explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for\n\"qualitative-enriched\" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct\nextension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed\nrecently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning\n(DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The\nquantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in\n$[0,\\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite\nordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than\nqualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts\ncan easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees.\nTwo simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched\nbelief assignments can be done."

    "summary": "In this paper we study cellular automata (CAs) that perform the computational\nMajority task. This task is a good example of what the phenomenon of emergence\nin complex systems is. We take an interest in the reasons that make this\nparticular fitness landscape a difficult one. The first goal is to study the\nlandscape as such, and thus it is ideally independent from the actual\nheuristics used to search the space. However, a second goal is to understand\nthe features a good search technique for this particular problem space should\npossess. We statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of\nsearching this landscape. Due to neutrality, investigations based on sampling\ntechniques on the whole landscape are difficult to conduct. So, we go exploring\nthe landscape from the top. Although it has been proved that no CA can perform\nthe task perfectly, several efficient CAs for this task have been found.\nExploiting similarities between these CAs and symmetries in the landscape, we\ndefine the Olympus landscape which is regarded as the ''heavenly home'' of the\nbest local optima known (blok). Then we measure several properties of this\nsubspace. Although it is easier to find relevant CAs in this subspace than in\nthe overall landscape, there are structural reasons that prevent a searcher\nfrom finding overfitted CAs in the Olympus. Finally, we study dynamics and\nperformance of genetic algorithms on the Olympus in order to confirm our\nanalysis and to find efficient CAs for the Majority problem with low\ncomputational cost."

    "summary": "This paper introduces the concept of fitness cloud as an alternative way to\nvisualize and analyze search spaces than given by the geographic notion of\nfitness landscape. It is argued that the fitness cloud concept overcomes\nseveral deficiencies of the landscape representation. Our analysis is based on\nthe correlation between fitness of solutions and fitnesses of nearest solutions\naccording to some neighboring. We focus on the behavior of local search\nheuristics, such as hill climber, on the well-known NK fitness landscape. In\nboth cases the fitness vs. fitness correlation is shown to be related to the\nepistatic parameter K."

The XML\ntemplate includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text\n(pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need\nto compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the\nrequired actions. We present in this paper the rules developed for this task.\nWe show that the system yields good performance when applied to the analysis of\nFrench practice guidelines."

    "summary": "We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian\ngraphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to\nreformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more\ntractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these\nconstraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which\nis then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization\nleads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then\nit corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise\nthere is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.\nThus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming\ntechniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product\n(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,\nwhere the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also\nconsider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.\nloops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we\npropose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''\nvariables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or\neliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or\nLagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the\niterative optimization procedure."
