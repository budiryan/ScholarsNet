    "summary": "We investigate, in the Shannon model, the security of constructions\ncorresponding to double and (two-key) triple DES. That is, we consider\nF_{k1}(F_{k2}(.)) and F_{k1}(F_{k2}^{-1}(F_{k1}(.))) with the component\nfunctions being ideal ciphers. This models the resistance of these\nconstructions to ``generic'' attacks like meet in the middle attacks. We obtain\nthe first proof that composition actually increases the security of these\nconstructions in some meaningful sense. We compute a bound on the probability\nof breaking the double cipher as a function of the number of computations of\nthe base cipher made, and the number of examples of the composed cipher seen,\nand show that the success probability is the square of that for a single key\ncipher. The same bound holds for the two-key triple cipher. The first bound is\ntight and shows that meet in the middle is the best possible generic attack\nagainst the double cipher.",

    "title": "Security Policy Specification Using a Graphical Approach", 
    "publish": "1998-09-30T17:00:20Z", 
    "summary": "A security policy states the acceptable actions of an information system, as\nthe actions bear on security. There is a pressing need for organizations to\ndeclare their security policies, even informal statements would be better than\nthe current practice. But, formal policy statements are preferable to support\n(1) reasoning about policies, e.g., for consistency and completeness, (2)\nautomated enforcement of the policy, e.g., using wrappers around legacy systems\nor after the fact with an intrusion detection system, and (3) other formal\nmanipulation of policies, e.g., the composition of policies. We present LaSCO,\nthe Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of\ntwo parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what\nis allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO\nhave the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies\nare specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual\nview of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we\nprovide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be\nvery perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have\nfound to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of\npolicies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to\ndescribe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an\nobject-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating\nsystem objects. A LaSCO specification can be automatically translated into\nexecutable code that checks an invocation of a program with respect to a\npolicy. The implementation of LaSCO is in Java, and generates wrappers to check\nJava programs with respect to a policy.",

    "publish": "2000-03-16T01:24:59Z", 
    "summary": "In this dissertation, we present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints\non Objects, a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs\nand present a method for enforcing policies so expressed. Other approaches for\nstating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to\neither policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may\nbe expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable\nproperties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many\ndifferent systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail,\nuser friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal\nreasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs\nannotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy\napplies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse\napplications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems,\ndistributed systems, and networks.\n  Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for\nimplementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of\nthe system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO\nfor Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to\nfacilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a\nnetwork as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large\nnetworks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that\nenable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of\nprecisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and\nimplementing it on a system.",

    "summary": "Strand spaces are a popular framework for the analysis of security protocols.\nStrand spaces have some similarities to a formalism used successfully to model\nprotocols for distributed systems, namely multi-agent systems. We explore the\nexact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key\ndifference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces\nand explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from\nstrand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in\nthe strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest\ncan be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in\nthe strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To\nhighlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand\nspaces can be extended to model more systems.",

    "summary": "Since 1981, when Lamport introduced the remote user authentication scheme\nusing table, a plenty of schemes had been proposed with tables or without table\nusing. Recently Das et al. proposed a dynamic id-based remote user\nauthentication scheme.

In this paper we show that Das et al's scheme is completly insecure and\nusing of this scheme is like an open server access without password.",

Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not\nsecure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding\nplaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce\nforgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out\nthat also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an\nauthentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are\nnot secure due to the aforementioned attack.

We model our\nabstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web\nservices.

To\nvalidate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the\ncorrect authentication of requests and responses.

    "summary": "During the last years, large-scale simulations of realistic physical\nenvironments which support the interaction of multiple participants over the\nInternet have become increasingly available and economically significant, most\nnotably in the computer gaming industry. Such systems, commonly called\nnetworked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server\narchitecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the\nsimulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural\nchoice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic\nintegrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the\nphysical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality\nof events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of\nsemantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive\npolicies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and\nare therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity\nprotocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to\naudit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates\nlow network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally\ndecouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the\nsimulation.",

This paper shows how techniques\nbased on Kolmogorov Complexity can help in the analysis of internet worms and\nnetwork traffic. Using compression, different species of worms can be clustered\nby type. This allows us to determine whether an unknown worm binary could in\nfact be a later version of an existing worm in an extremely simple, automated,\nmanner. This may become a useful tool in the initial analysis of malicious\nbinaries. Furthermore, compression can also be useful to distinguish different\ntypes of network traffic and can thus help to detect traffic anomalies: Certain\nanomalies may be detected by looking at the compressibility of a network\nsession alone. We furthermore show how to use compression to detect malicious\nnetwork sessions that are very similar to known intrusion attempts.

    "publish": "2005-04-18T13:45:51Z", 
    "summary": "Steganography is about how to send secret message covertly. And the purpose\nof steganalysis is to not only detect the existence of the hidden message but\nalso extract it. So far there have been many reliable detecting methods on\nvarious steganographic algorithms, while there are few approaches that can\nextract the hidden information. In this paper, the difficulty of extracting\nhidden information, which is essentially a kind of privacy, is analyzed with\ninformation-theoretic method in the terms of unicity distance of steganographic\nkey (abbreviated stego key). A lower bound for the unicity distance is\nobtained, which shows the relations between key rate, message rate, hiding\ncapacity and difficulty of extraction. Furthermore the extracting attack to\nsteganography is viewed as a special kind of cryptanalysis, and an effective\nmethod on recovering the stego key of popular LSB replacing steganography in\nspatial images is presented by combining the detecting technique of\nsteganalysis and correlation attack of cryptanalysis together. The analysis for\nthis method and experimental results on steganographic software ``Hide and Seek\n4.1\" are both accordant with the information-theoretic conclusion.",

For this reason we introduce SCRUB-PA, a tool\nthat uses multi-level multi-dimensional anonymization on process accounting log\nfiles in order to provide different levels of privacy protection.

Ciphers of this kind are\nflexible: One could choose a suitable combination of instructions to obtain due\nperformance without affecting the quality of the output sequence.

    "summary": "Basic role based access control [RBAC] provides a mechanism for segregating\naccess privileges based upon a user's hierarchical roles within an\norganization. This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of\nmultiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement\nfor different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our\ncase, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be\neffectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's\norganizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy\nto be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations\nare served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their\naccess as needed.\n  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for\naccurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies\nfor providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the\namount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.\nThe resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and\nvisualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will\ngive some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and\nprivileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges\ncan be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by\njoint tenancy.",

In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the\nfollowing soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security\nproperties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and\nauthenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies\nsecurity in the label-based model.

    "summary": "With the rapid spread of various mobile terminals in our society, the\nimportance of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in\nadversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure\npositioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric\nproperty of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics\nthat a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In\nparticular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio\nsignal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the\nchallenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct\nthe above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of\nbidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a\nmobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant\nprotected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and\nthe time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.\nOur proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile\nterminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to\nthe trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is\nfree from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations\nin the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the\nopen air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze\nthe security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in\ncomparison to previous proposals.",

The reversible designs of a\ncarry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are\npresented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the\nTSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to\ndesign the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential\ncircuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to\ndesign a reversible modulo multiplier. It is intended that this paper will\nprovide a starting point for developing cryptosystems secure against DPA\nattacks.",

We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular\nof anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for\ninstance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the\nparties should be considered invisible to the adversary.\n  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which\nbetter model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their\ndecision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the\nadversary.\n  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible\nschedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are\nindependent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical\ncases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is\npossible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary\n`noticing'.",

In a better case\nusing a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe\nO(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),\nwhere the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,\nXSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit.

The float-point operation complies with the\nreproduce theorem without the external random perturbation. The computation\nuncertainty principle and the high nonlinear of chaotic system guarantee the\nnumerical error is random and departure from the analytical result. Combining\nthese two properties we can produce unilateral one-way function and provide a\ncase of utilizing this function to construct encryption algorithm. The\nmultiple-precision (MP) library is used to analyze nonlinear dynamics systems\nand achieve the code. As an example, we provide a scheme of encrypting a\nplaintext by employing the one-way function with Lorenz system. Since the\nnumerical solution used in this scheme is beyond the maximum effective\ncomputation time (MECT) and it cannot satisfy the requirements of return-map\nanalysis and phase space reconstruction, it can block some existing attacks.",

However, there is an inherent trade off between\nthe amount of information revealed in the log and the usefulness of the log to\nthe client (the utility of a log). There are many anonymization techniques, and\nthere are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to\nanonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with\nvarying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of\ndifferent anonymization policies on logs. We provide an empirical analysis of\nthe effect of varying anonymization policies by looking at the number of alerts\ngenerated by an Intrusion Detection System.

These signatures can be\nused as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional\nfunctionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature\nto any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message\nwas indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We\npropose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our\nfirst scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be\nanalyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery\nassuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the\nknowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the\nBoneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle\nmodel, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman\nproblem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained\ncomputation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are\npairing-free.

At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger\nrevisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and\nefficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open\nthe problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is\nable to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated\nseveral times.\n  This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago,\nand shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We\ndescribe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the\nAteniese-Hohenberger model.

For the same reason of\nresources restriction, key distribution mechanisms which are used in\ntraditional wireless networks are not efficient for sensor networks.\n  To overcome the key distribution problem, several key pre-distribution\nalgorithms and techniques that assign keys or keying material for the networks\nnodes in an offline phase have been introduced recently. In this paper, we\nintroduce a supplemental distribution technique based on the communication\npattern and deployment knowledge modeling. Our technique is based on the\nhierarchical grid deployment. For granting a proportional security level with\nnumber of dependent sensors, we use different polynomials in different orders\nwith different weights. In seek of our proposed work's value, we provide a\ndetailed analysis on the used resources, resulting security, resiliency, and\nconnectivity compared with other related works.",

    "summary": "In discrete logarithm based cryptography, a method by Pohlig and Hellman\nallows solving the discrete logarithm problem efficiently if the group order is\nknown and has no large prime factors. The consequence is that such groups are\navoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on\ncyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be\nadapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain\ninfrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result\nby M\\\"uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from\nhyperelliptic function fields.\n  We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic\ninfrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from\ncertain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain\ncyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the\nPohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a\ncomputationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an\nalgorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain\nrequirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether\nthe Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number\nfields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic\ninfrastructures.",

    "summary": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of\nthe future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",

    "summary": "We study the relationship between obfuscation and white-box cryptography. We\ncapture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \\emph{White-Box\nProperty (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the\nWBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a\n\\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an\nobfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak\nsome ``useless'' non-black-box information.\n  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an\nobfuscation (under \\emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every\nspecification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a\n\\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply\nthat under \\emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We\nthen show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist\n(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.\n  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a\nnon-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain\nspecification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but\napproximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.\n  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between\n``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information.",

The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the\nauthorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is\nunconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter\ncan cause the protocol to fail.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of building robust fuzzy extractors, which allow two\nparties holding similar random variables W, W' to agree on a secret key R in\nthe presence of an active adversary. Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by\nDodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P,\nwhich can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the\nother. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in\ntime (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an\nadditional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the\nadversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors\nsecure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.\n  We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts\na shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and\nsecurity parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W. The\npreviously best known result, also of Dodis et al., extracted up to (2m-n)/3\nbits (depending on the same parameters).",

    "summary": "We have designed a new class of public key algorithms based on quasigroup\nstring transformations using a specific class of quasigroups called\nmultivariate quadratic quasigroups (MQQ). Our public key algorithm is a\nbijective mapping, it does not perform message expansions and can be used both\nfor encryption and signatures. The public key consist of n quadratic\npolynomials with n variables where n=140, 160, ... . A particular\ncharacteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly\nparallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric\nblock cipher - the reason for the phrase \"A Public Key Block Cipher\" in the\ntitle of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the\nalgorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo\n-- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores\nand OpenMP 2.0 library. However, implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA that is\nrunning on 249.4 MHz it achieves decryption throughput of 399 Mbps, and\nimplemented on four Xilinx Virtex-5 chips that are running on 276.7 MHz it\nachieves encryption throughput of 44.27 Gbps.

    "summary": "In the Horn theory based approach for cryptographic protocol analysis,\ncryptographic protocols and (Dolev-Yao) intruders are modeled by Horn theories\nand security analysis boils down to solving the derivation problem for Horn\ntheories.

However, dealing with the\nalgebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) has been\nproblematic. In particular, ProVerif cannot deal with XOR. In this paper, we\nshow how to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories with XOR to the\nXOR-free case. Our reduction works for an expressive class of Horn theories. A\nlarge class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator\ncan be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol\nanalysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very\nefficient in the XOR-free case.

    "summary": "Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This\nmakes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations,\ninto an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric\nstudies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse\nselection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were\nfound among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those\nwithout. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust\nauthorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics\nsuggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if\ntrust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of\ntrust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to\npower-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust.\nThe evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are\nknown to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive\nattacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust\nbuilding, and suggest some ideas for exploration.",

    "summary": "Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the\npractice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality\nillegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of\nobscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and\nusability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool\nJDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using\nvarious array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array\nfolding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system\nobfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code\nthat is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number\nof experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our\ntool.",

    "publish": "2008-12-13T02:59:37Z", 
    "summary": "Strongly multiplicative linear secret sharing schemes (LSSS) have been a\npowerful tool for constructing secure multiparty computation protocols.\nHowever, it remains open whether or not there exist efficient constructions of\nstrongly multiplicative LSSS from general LSSS. In this paper, we propose the\nnew concept of a 3-multiplicative LSSS, and establish its relationship with\nstrongly multiplicative LSSS. More precisely, we show that any 3-multiplicative\nLSSS is a strongly multiplicative LSSS, but the converse is not true; and that\nany strongly multiplicative LSSS can be efficiently converted into a\n3-multiplicative LSSS. Furthermore, we apply 3-multiplicative LSSS to the\ncomputation of unbounded fan-in multiplication, which reduces its round\ncomplexity to four (from five of the previous protocol based on strongly\nmultiplicative LSSS). We also give two constructions of 3-multiplicative LSSS\nfrom Reed-Muller codes and algebraic geometric codes. We believe that the\nconstruction and verification of 3-multiplicative LSSS are easier than those of\nstrongly multiplicative LSSS. This presents a step forward in settling the open\nproblem of efficient constructions of strongly multiplicative LSSS from general\nLSSS.",

To this\nend, a plethora of (socalled) key pre-distribution schemes have been proposed\nin the past.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel method for secure initialization of sensor nodes based on a\nvisual out-of-band channel. Using the proposed method, the administrator of a\nsensor network can distribute keys onto the sensor nodes, necessary to\nbootstrap key pre-distribution. Our secure initialization method requires only\na little extra cost, is efficient and scalable with respect to the number of\nsensor nodes. Moreover, based on a usability study that we conducted, the\nmethod turns out to be quite user-friendly and easy to use by naive human\nusers.",

    "publish": "2009-02-02T17:36:48Z", 
    "summary": "Most behavioral detectors of malware remain specific to a given language and\nplatform, mostly PE executables for Windows. The objective of this paper is to\ndefine a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers\nrespectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The first abstraction\nlayer remains specific to a platform and a language. This first layer\ninterprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies\nthese operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in\nthe malware lifecycle. The second detection layer remains generic and is\ntotally interoperable between the different abstraction components. This layer\nrelies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are\nused for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow).\nTo feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two\ndifferent abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native\ncode and one processing the VBScript interpreted language. The different\nexperimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for\nscript files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process\ntraces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by\nmore sophisticated collection tools.",

    "summary": "Since the seminal work from F. Cohen in the eighties, abstract virology has\nseen the apparition of successive viral models, all based on Turing-equivalent\nformalisms. But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes,\nthese viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is\nthat Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New\nmodels have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but\nloosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a\nunified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the\nJoin-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the\nfundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for\ninteractions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more\ncomplex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly\nmodeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of\nundecidability and isolation still hold. However the process-based model has\npermitted to establish new results: identification of fragments from the\nJoin-Calculus where malware detection becomes decidable, formal definition of\nthe non-infection property, approximate solutions to restrict malware\npropagation.",

The scheme is based on the\nassumption that the information exchanged during at least one of every n\nsuccessive communication sessions is not exposed to an adversary. The Tag and\nthe Verifier maintain a vector of n entries that is repeatedly refreshed by\npairwise xoring entries, with a new vector of n entries that is randomly chosen\nby the Tag and sent to the Verifier as a part of each communication session.\nThe general case in which the adversary does not listen in k > 0 sessions among\nany n successive communication sessions is also considered.

A computational secure scheme which is based on\nthe information theoretic secure scheme is used to ensure that even in the case\nthat the adversary listens in all the information exchanges, the communication\nbetween the Tag and the Verifier is secure.",

This framework does not depend on any other 3rd party software and it\nis developed entirely in user mode (ring3). MmmBop supports the IA-32\narchitecture and it is targeted for Microsoft Windows XP, some of the further\ndeliberations will be referring directly to this operating system.",

It\nwas created with the purpose of providing a tool which would aid vulnerability\nand security researchers with tracing and analyzing any necessary data and its\nfurther propagation through a program. At the current state it works on IA-32\nplatforms with Microsoft Windows systems and it supports FPU, SSE, MMX and all\nof the IA-32 general instructions. SpiderPig also demonstrates the usage of a\nvirtual code integration (VCI) framework which allows for modifying the target\napplication code at the instruction level. By this I mean that the VCI\nframework allows for custom code insertion, original code modification and full\ncustomization of the original application's code.

We present improved cheater detection algorithms\nthat utilize natural delays that exist in long-term grid computations.

The main idea of this algorithm might at first seem\ncounter-intuitive--we have the participants check each other's work. A naive\nimplementation of this approach would, of course, be susceptible to collusion\nattacks, but we show that by, adapting efficient solutions to the parallel\nprocessor diagnosis problem, we can tolerate collusions of lazy cheaters, even\nif the number of such cheaters is a fraction of the total number of\nparticipants. We also include a simple economic analysis of cheaters in grid\ncomputations and a parameterization of the main deterrent that can be used\nagainst them--the probability of being caught.",

    "summary": "Memory corruption attacks remain the primary threat for computer security.\nInformation flow tracking or taint analysis has been proven to be effective\nagainst most memory corruption attacks. However, there are two shortcomings\nwith current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause\napplication slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second,\nthese techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do\nnot overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite\ncritical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to\naddress these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique\nthat uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects.\nWe propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by\nuntrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We\nperformed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it\ncan detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string\nattacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known\napproaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not\nrequire the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance\noverhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application\nslowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing\napproaches.

    "summary": "The vast majority of RFID authentication protocols assume the proximity\nbetween readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel.\nHowever, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag)\nand the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover\nis in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in\nwhich scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included.\nDistance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder\nrelay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but\nvulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of\nthem. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with\nthe objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag\ncomputational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this\nprotocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an\nadversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack\nis very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s\nprotocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating\nprotocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient\nschemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and\ninspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously.",

    "summary": "Random number generation is a fundamental security primitive for RFID\ndevices. However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the\ncapacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must\nbe taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the\nimplementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag,\nwhich is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By\nrelating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication\nprotocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness\ntechniques on resource constrained devices.",

    "summary": "We present an in-depth analysis on the strength of the almost 10,000\npasswords from users of an instant messaging server in Italy. We estimate the\nstrength of those passwords, and compare the effectiveness of state-of-the-art\nattack methods such as dictionaries and Markov chain-based techniques.\n  We show that the strength of passwords chosen by users varies enormously, and\nthat the cost of attacks based on password strength grows very quickly when the\nattacker wants to obtain a higher success percentage. In accordance with\nexisting studies we observe that, in the absence of measures for enforcing\npassword strength, weak passwords are common. On the other hand we discover\nthat there will always be a subset of users with extremely strong passwords\nthat are very unlikely to be broken.\n  The results of our study will help in evaluating the security of\npassword-based authentication means, and they provide important insights for\ninspiring new and better proactive password checkers and password recovery\ntools.",

    "summary": "In this work we investigate the problem of simultaneous privacy and integrity\nprotection in cryptographic circuits. We consider a white-box scenario with a\npowerful, yet limited attacker. A concise metric for the level of probing and\nfault security is introduced, which is directly related to the capabilities of\na realistic attacker. In order to investigate the interrelation of probing and\nfault security we introduce a common mathematical framework based on the\nformalism of information and coding theory. The framework unifies the known\nlinear masking schemes. We proof a central theorem about the properties of\nlinear codes which leads to optimal secret sharing schemes. These schemes\nprovide the lower bound for the number of masks needed to counteract an\nattacker with a given strength. The new formalism reveals an intriguing duality\nprinciple between the problems of probing and fault security, and provides a\nunified view on privacy and integrity protection using error detecting codes.\nFinally, we introduce a new class of linear tamper-resistant codes. These are\neligible to preserve security against an attacker mounting simultaneous probing\nand fault attacks.",

In this way,\nlegitimate users can be reliably authenticated and false users can be reliably\ndetected. To evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm, we simulate spatially\nvariable channel responses in real environments using the WiSE ray-tracing\ntool; and we analyze the ability of a receiver to discriminate between\ntransmitters (users) based on their channel frequency responses in a given\noffice environment.

Recently, several researchers\nhave proposed schemes in which they have used group-based deployment models and\nassumed predeployment knowledge of the expected locations of nodes. They have\nshown that these schemes achieve better performance than the basic schemes, in\nterms of connectivity, resilience against node capture and storage\nrequirements. But in many situations expected locations of nodes are not\navailable. In this paper we propose a solution which uses the basic scheme, but\ndoes not use group-based deployment model and predeployment knowledge of the\nlocations of nodes, and yet performs better than schemes which make the\naforementioned assumptions.\n  In our scheme, groups are formed after deployment of sensor nodes, on the\nbasis of their physical locations, and the nodes sample keys from disjoint key\npools. Compromise of a node affects secure links with other nodes that are part\nof its group only. Because of this reason, our scheme performs better than the\nbasic schemes and the schemes using predeployment knowledge, in terms of\nconnectivity, storage requirement, and security. Moreover, the post-deployment\nkey generation process completes sooner than in schemes like LEAP+.",

    "summary": "Privacy leaks are an unfortunate and an integral part of the current Internet\ndomain name resolution. Each DNS query generated by a user reveals -- to one or\nmore DNS servers -- the origin and target of that query. Over time, a user's\nbrowsing behavior might be exposed to entities with little or no trust. Current\nDNS privacy leaks stem from fundamental DNS features and are not easily fixable\nby simple patches. Moreover, privacy issues have been overlooked by DNS\nsecurity efforts (i.e. DNSSEC) and are thus likely to propagate into future\nversions of DNS.\n  In order to mitigate privacy issues in current DNS, this paper proposes a\nPrivacy-Preserving Domain Name System (PPDNS), which maintains privacy during\ndomain name resolution. PPDNS is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), an\nalternative naming infrastructure, and computational private information\nretrieval (cPIR), an advanced cryptographic construct. PPDNS takes advantage of\nthe DHT's index structure to improve name resolution query privacy, while\nleveraging cPIR to reduce communication overhead for bandwidth-sensitive\nclients. Our analysis shows that PPDNS is a viable approach for obtaining a\nhigher degree of privacy for name resolution queries.

    "summary": "Latest developments in VLSI, wireless communications, and biomedical sensing\ndevices allow very small, lightweight, low power, intelligent sensing devices\ncalled biosensors. A set of these devices can be integrated into a Wireless\nBiomedical Sensor Network (WBSN), a new breakthrough technology used in\ntelemedicine for monitoring the physiological condition of an individual. The\nbiosensor nodes in WBSN has got resource limitations in terms of battery\nlifetime, CPU processing capability, and memory capacity. Replacement or\nrecharging of batteries on thousands of biosensor nodes is quiet difficult or\ntoo costly. So, a key challenge in wireless biomedical sensor networks is the\nreduction of energy and memory consumption. Considering, the sensitivity of\ninformation in WBSN, we must provide security and patient privacy, as it is an\nimportant issue in the design of such systems. Hence this paper proposes an\nenergy efficient security protocol for WBSN where security is provided to the\nphysiological data, which is being transmitted from the sensor node to the sink\ndevice. This is achieved by authenticating the data using patients biometric,\nencrypting the data using Quasi Group cryptography after compressing the image\ndata using an energy efficient number theory based technique.",

The study also introduce a novel \"Firewall Complexity\"\n(FC) measure, that applies to both types of firewalls.\n  The findings of the current study indeed validate the 2004 study's main\nobservations: firewalls are (still) poorly configured, and a rule-set's\ncomplexity is (still) positively correlated with the number of detected risk\nitems. Thus we can conclude that, for well-configured firewalls, ``small is\n(still) beautiful''.

But what if a\nprogram intentionally makes a tradeoff between security and efficiency and\nleaks some information through a side channel? In this paper we study such\ntradeoffs using ideas from recent research on declassification. We present a\nsemantic model of security for programs which allow for declassification\nthrough side channels, and show how side-channel declassification can be\nverified using off-the-shelf software model checking tools. Finally, to make it\nsimpler for verifiers to check that a program conforms to a particular\nside-channel declassification policy we introduce a further tradeoff between\nefficiency and verifiability: by writing programs in a particular \"manifest\nform\" security becomes considerably easier to verify.",

    "summary": "This paper discusses the application of known techniques, knowledge and\ntechnology in a novel way for encryption. Two distinct and separate methods are\npresented.\n  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant\nsymbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more\ncommonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be\npossible. Hence, decryption will be possible.\n  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering\nto convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several\npossible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking\nanother language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.\nFibonacci, Phi or Prime.\n  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.\n  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.\nFirst the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.\n  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of\nplaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this\ntransitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with\nencrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It\nmay produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much\nmore computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force\ndecryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are\ncomputationally secure--impervious to brute force.\n  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.\n(Similar to adding random padding to the encryption.) However, this is\nacceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:\n  Both methods are not decryptable by method uncrackable - by conventional,\nstatistical means.",

    "summary": "Increasing numbers of mobile computing devices, user-portable, or embedded in\nvehicles, cargo containers, or the physical space, need to be aware of their\nlocation in order to provide a wide range of commercial services. Most often,\nmobile devices obtain their own location with the help of Global Navigation\nSatellite Systems (GNSS), integrating, for example, a Global Positioning System\n(GPS) receiver. Nonetheless, an adversary can compromise location-aware\napplications by attacking the GNSS-based positioning: It can forge navigation\nmessages and mislead the receiver into calculating a fake location. In this\npaper, we analyze this vulnerability and propose and evaluate the effectiveness\nof countermeasures. First, we consider replay attacks, which can be effective\neven in the presence of future cryptographic GNSS protection mechanisms. Then,\nwe propose and analyze methods that allow GNSS receivers to detect the\nreception of signals generated by an adversary, and then reject fake locations\ncalculated because of the attack. We consider three diverse defense mechanisms,\nall based on knowledge, in particular, own location, time, and Doppler shift,\nreceivers can obtain prior to the onset of an attack. We find that inertial\nmechanisms that estimate location can be defeated relatively easy. This is\nequally true for the mechanism that relies on clock readings from off-the-shelf\ndevices; as a result, highly stable clocks could be needed. On the other hand,\nour Doppler Shift Test can be effective without any specialized hardware, and\nit can be applied to existing devices.",

    "summary": "Internet worm infection continues to be one of top security threats and has\nbeen widely used by botnets to recruit new bots. In this work, we attempt to\nquantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key\ncharacteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the\nnumber of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree.\nSpecifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential\ngrowth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We\nanalytically and empirically find that the number of children has\nasymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on\naverage half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98%\nof infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of\ninfected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the\ngeneration follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length\nof the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with\nthe total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection\nstructure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the\nabove observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply\nour findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential\ncountermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer\ndiscovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that\ntargeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of\nchildren is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows\nthat when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots.\nHowever, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of\nchildren to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed\nof worm infection.",

    "summary": "In recent times, a necessity has been raised in order to distribute computing\napplications often across grids. These applications are dependent on the\nservices like data transfer or data portal services as well as submission of\njobs. Security is of utmost importance in grid computing applications as grid\nresources are heterogeneous, dynamic, and multidomain. Authentication remains\nas the significant security challenge in grid environment. In traditional\nauthentication protocol a single server stores the sensitive user credentials,\nlike username and password. When such a server is compromised, a large number\nof user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses a dual\nauthentication protocol in order to improve the authentication service in grid\nenvironment. The protocol utilizes the fundamental concepts of trigon and based\non the parameters of the trigon the user authentication will be performed. In\nthe proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than\none unit and these units are stored in two different servers, namely,\nAuthentication Server and Backend Server. Only when the combined authentication\nscheme from both the servers authenticates the user, the privilege of accessing\nthe requested resources is obtained by the user. The main advantage of\nutilizing the dual authentication protocol in grid computing is that an\nadversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single\nconsolidated server because of the fact that the split password is stored in\ndifferent servers.",

    "summary": "Modern mobile phones are increasingly being used for more services that\nrequire modern security mechanisms such as the public key cryptosystem RSA. It\nis, however, well known that public key cryptography demands considerable\ncomputing resources and that RSA encryption is much faster than RSA decryption.\nIt is consequently an interesting question if RSA as a whole can be executed\nefficiently on modern mobile phones. In this paper, we explore the efficiency\non modern mobile phones of variants of the RSA cryptosystem, covering CRT,\nMultiPrime RSA, MultiPower RSA, Rebalanced RSA and R Prime RSA by comparing the\nencryption and decryption time using a simple Java implementation and a typical\nRSA setup.",

Static Combination of Duty (SCD) and\nDynamic Combination of Duty (DCD) constraints have been introduced recently for\nthis model to handle dependent roles.

Organizations all over the world handle large\namounts of data and are dependent on mining gigantic data sets for expansion of\ntheir enterprises. These data sets typically contain sensitive individual\ninformation, which consequently get exposed to the other parties. Though we\ncannot deny the benefits of knowledge discovery that comes through data mining,\nwe should also ensure that data privacy is maintained in the event of data\nmining. Privacy preserving data mining is a specialized activity in which the\ndata privacy is ensured during data mining. Data privacy is as important as the\nextracted knowledge and efforts that guarantee data privacy during data mining\nare encouraged. In this paper we propose a strategy that protects the data\nprivacy during decision tree analysis of data mining process.

Initially, the features, minutiae points and\ntexture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template.

    "summary": "The non-repudiation as an essential requirement of many applications can be\nprovided by the asymmetric key model. With the evolution of new applications\nsuch as mobile commerce, it is essential to provide secure and efficient\nsolutions for the mobile environments. The traditional public key cryptography\ninvolves huge computational costs and is not so suitable for the\nresource-constrained platforms. The elliptic curve-based approaches as the\nnewer solutions require certain considerations that are not taken into account\nin the traditional public key infrastructures. The main contribution of this\npaper is to introduce a Lightweight Public Key Infrastructure (LPKI) for the\nconstrained platforms such as mobile phones. It takes advantages of elliptic\ncurve cryptography and signcryption to decrease the computational costs and\ncommunication overheads, and adapting to the constraints. All the computational\ncosts of required validations can be eliminated from end-entities by\nintroduction of a validation authority to the introduced infrastructure and\ndelegating validations to such a component. LPKI is so suitable for mobile\nenvironments and for applications such as mobile commerce where the security is\nthe great concern.",

In this paper, we study\nthe architecture of the world's largest service provider, i.e., Google. First,\nwith the exception of a few services that can only be accessed over HTTPS\n(e.g., Gmail), we find that many Google services are still vulnerable to simple\nsession hijacking. Next, we present the Historiographer, a novel attack that\nreconstructs the web search history of Google users, i.e., Google's Web\nHistory, even though such a service is supposedly protected from session\nhijacking by a stricter access control policy. The Historiographer uses a\nreconstruction technique inferring search history from the personalized\nsuggestions fed by the Google search engine. We validate our technique through\nexperiments conducted over real network traffic and discuss possible\ncountermeasures. Our attacks are general and not only specific to Google, and\nhighlight privacy concerns of mixed architectures using both secure and\ninsecure connections.",

    "publish": "2010-03-17T20:10:52Z", 
    "summary": "Many steganographic techniques were proposed for hiding secret message inside\nimages, the simplest of them being the LSB data hiding. In this paper, we\nsuggest a novel data hiding technique in an HTML Web page and also propose some\nsimple techniques to extend the embedding technique to source codes written in\nany programming language (both case insensitive like HTML, Pascal and case\nsensitive languages like C, C++, Java). We basically try to exploit the\ncase-redundancy in case-insensitive language, while we try hiding data with\nminimal changes in the source code (almost not raising suspicion). HTML Tags\nare case insensitive and hence an alphabet in lowercase and one in uppercase\npresent inside an HTML tag are interpreted in the same manner by the browser,\ni.e., change in case in a web page is imperceptible to the browser. We first\nexploit this redundancy and use it to embed secret data inside an web page,\nwith no changes visible to the user of the web page, so that he can not even\nsuspect about the data hiding. The embedded data can be recovered by viewing\nthe source of the HTML page. This technique can easily be extended to embed\nsecret message inside any piece of source-code where the standard interpreter\nof that language is case-insensitive. For case-sensitive programming languages\nwe do minimal changes in the source code (e.g., add an extra character in the\ntoken identified by the lexical analyzer) without violating the lexical and\nsyntactic notation for that language) and try to make the change almost\nimperceptible.",

    "summary": "In this paper, a few novel data hiding techniques are proposed. These\ntechniques are improvements over the classical LSB data hiding technique and\nthe Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. \\cite{r1}.\nThe classical LSB technique is the simplest, but using this technique it is\npossible to embed only in first few bit-planes, since image quality becomes\ndrastically distorted when embedding in higher bit-planes. Battisti et al.\n\\cite{r1} proposed an improvement over this by using Fibonacci decomposition\ntechnique and generating a different set of virtual bit-planes all together,\nthereby increasing the number of bit-planes. In this paper, first we\nmathematically model and generalize this particular approach of virtual\nbit-plane generation. Then we propose two novel embedding techniques, both of\nwhich are special-cases of our generalized model. The first embedding scheme is\nbased on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime numbers, while\nthe second one is based on decomposition in sum of natural numbers. Each of\nthese particular representations generates a different set of (virtual)\nbit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one\nto embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much\ndistortion, with a much better stego-image quality, in a reliable and secured\nmanner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative\nperformance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the\ndata hiding technique using Fibonacci -p-Sequence decomposition and our\nproposed schemes has been done. Theoretical analysis indicates that image\nquality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci\ndecomposition improves against simple LSB substitution method, while the same\nusing the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using\nFibonacci decomposition technique, and finally the natural number decomposition\nmethod is a further improvement against that using prime decomposition\ntechnique. Also, optimality for the last technique is proved. For both of our\ndata-hiding techniques, the experimental results show that, the stego-image is\nvisually indistinguishable from the original cover image.",

    "publish": "2010-04-14T09:45:10Z", 
    "summary": "In (k, n) visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, secret image can be visually\nreconstructed when k or more participants printing theirs shares on\ntransparencies and stack them together. No secret is revealed with fewer than k\nshares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality\nof the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original\nsecret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is\nprinted on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment\nor the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that\nin the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this\nalignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may\nstill be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the\nhorizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to\nconstruct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks\nfor the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of\nredundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme\nthat allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and\nvertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the\nreconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a\nshift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the\ntraditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very\nlittle shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method\ninvolves a larger pixel expansion. The basic building block of our scheme is\nduplication and concatenation of certain rows or columns of the basic matrices.\nThis seemingly simple but very powerful construction principle can be easily\nused to create more general (k, n)-VSS schemes.",

    "summary": "Asymmetric password based key exchange is a key exchange protocol where a\nclient and a server share a low entropic password while the server additionally\nowns a high entropic secret for a public key. There are simple solutions for\nthis (e.g. Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and its improvement by\nBoyarsky (CCS 1999)). In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of\nprotocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to\ncryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\\em\nquickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,\none should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary\nattack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key\nexchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high\nentropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer\nfrom this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.\nHowever, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only\nconsider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study\nefficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new\nthreat. In this paper, we first provide a formal model for the new threat,\nwhere essentially we require that the active adversary can break $\\ell$\npasswords in $\\alpha\\ell |{\\cal D}|$ steps (for $\\alpha<1/2$) only with a\nprobability negligibly close to $\\exp(-\\beta\\ell)$ for some $\\beta>0$. Then, we\nconstruct a framework of asymmetric password based key exchange. We prove that\nour protocol is secure in the usual sense. We also show that it prevents the\nnew threat. To do this, we introduce a new technique by abstracting a\nprobabilistic experiment from the main proof and providing a neat analysis of\nit.",

Each\nDC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one member's\nmessage, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity under our\nattack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and one-to-one\ncorrespondence between members and messages, makes denial-of-service attacks by\nmembers traceable to the culprit, and efficiently handles large and unbalanced\nmessage loads.

    "summary": "Key management in wireless sensor networks faces several new challenges. The\nscale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate\nthe use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves. However, the cost\nof such schemes is high since their secrecy is based on computational\ncomplexity. Recently, several research contributions justified that the\nwireless channel itself can be used to generate information-theoretic secure\nkeys. By exchanging sampling messages during movement, a bit string can be\nderived that is only known to the involved entities. Yet, movement is not the\nonly possibility to generate randomness. The channel response is also strongly\ndependent on the frequency of the transmitted signal. In our work, we introduce\na protocol for key generation based on the frequency-selectivity of channel\nfading. The practical advantage of this approach is that we do not require node\nmovement. Thus, the frequent case of a sensor network with static motes is\nsupported. Furthermore, the error correction property of the protocol mitigates\nthe effects of measurement errors and other temporal effects, giving rise to an\nagreement rate of over 97%. We show the applicability of our protocol by\nimplementing it on MICAz motes, and evaluate its robustness and secrecy through\nexperiments and analysis.",

    "summary": "The notion of an ad hoc network is a new paradigm that allows mobile hosts\n(nodes) to communicate without relying on a predefined infrastructure to keep\nthe network connected. Most nodes are assumed to be mobile and communication is\nassumed to be wireless. The mobility of nodes in an ad-hoc network means that\nboth the population and the topology of the network are highly dynamic. It is\nvery difficult to design a once-for-all intrusion detection system. A secure\nprotocol should atleast include mechanisms against known attack types. In\naddition, it should provide a scheme to easily add new security features in the\nfuture. The paper includes the detailed description of Proposed Intrusion\nDetection System based on Local Reputation Scheme. The proposed System also\nincludes concept of Redemption and Fading these are mechanism that allow nodes\npreviously considered malicious to become a part of the network again.

    "summary": "In secure multi-party computation $n$ parties jointly evaluate an $n$-variate\nfunction $f$ in the presence of an adversary which can corrupt up till $t$\nparties. Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far\nassume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This\nassumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne\nfrom relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually\nomnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b)\nOnly a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and\nadversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network.\n  This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty\ncomputation problem which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to\nthe above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature\nfrom both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure\nmulti-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting\nthe parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. For this setting,\nsome honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via\ncorrupted channels and may not be able to authentically communicate with them.\nSuch parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or\nprivacy. We present refined definitions of security for this new intermediate\nmodel of unconditional multiparty computation.

We call this counter-intuitive\ntechnique the {\\em encoding-encryption} paradigm, and use as motivating example\nthe standard for mobile telephony GSM. The enhanced security is based on a\ndedicated homophonic or wire-tap channel coding that introduces pure\nrandomness, combined with the randomness of the noise occurring over the\ncommunication channel. Security evaluation regarding recovery of the secret key\nemployed in the keystream generator is done through an information theoretical\napproach. We show that with the aid of a dedicated wire-tap encoder, the amount\nof uncertainty that the adversary must face about the secret key given all the\ninformation he could gather during different passive or active attacks he can\nmount, is a decreasing function of the sample available for cryptanalysis. This\nmeans that the wire-tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical\nsecurity level over a period of time, but after a large enough sample is\ncollected the function tends to zero, entering a regime in which a\ncomputational security analysis is needed for estimation of the resistance\nagainst the secret key recovery.",

The ability to\ncluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques\npossible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster.\nTo compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores\nvia graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance.

The security of\nthe UCS-RFID relies on five dynamic secret keys which are updated at every\nprotocol run using a fresh random number (nonce) secretly transmitted from a\nreader to tags. Our results show that, at the highest security level of the\nprotocol (security parameter= 256), inferring a nonce is feasible with the\nprobability of 0.99 by eavesdropping(observing) about 90 runs of the protocol.\nFinding a nonce enable a passive attacker to recover all five secret keys of\nthe protocol. To do so, we propose a three-phase probabilistic approach in this\npaper. Our attack recovers the secret keys with a probability that increases by\naccessing to more protocol runs. We also show that tracing a tag using this\nprotocol is also possible even with less runs of the protocol.",

    "summary": "Almost all known secret sharing schemes work on numbers. Such methods will\nhave difficulty in sharing graphs since the number of graphs increases\nexponentially with the number of nodes. We propose a secret sharing scheme for\ngraphs where we use graph intersection for reconstructing the secret which is\nhidden as a sub graph in the shares. Our method does not rely on heavy\ncomputational operations such as modular arithmetic or polynomial interpolation\nbut makes use of very basic operations like assignment and checking for\nequality, and graph intersection can also be performed visually. In certain\ncases, the secret could be reconstructed using just pencil and paper by\nauthorised parties but cannot be broken by an adversary even with unbounded\ncomputational power. The method achieves perfect secrecy for (2, n) scheme and\nrequires far fewer operations compared to Shamir's algorithm. The proposed\nmethod could be used to share objects such as matrices, sets, plain text and\neven a heterogeneous collection of these. Since we do not require a previously\nagreed upon encoding scheme, the method is very suitable for sharing\nheterogeneous collection of objects in a dynamic fashion.",

    "publish": "2010-10-25T04:11:13Z", 
    "summary": "Intrusion detection systems have become a key component in ensuring the\nsafety of systems and networks. As networks grow in size and speed continues to\nincrease, it is crucial that efficient scalable techniques should be developed\nfor IDS systems. Signature based detection is the most extensively used threat\ndetection technique for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). One of the foremost\nchallenges for signaturebased IDS systems is how to keep up with large volume\nof incoming traffic when each packet needs to be compared with every signature\nin the database. When an IDS cannot keep up with the traffic flood, all it can\ndo is to drop packets, therefore, may miss potential attacks. This paper\nproposes a new model called Dynamic Multi-Layer Signature based IDS using\nMobile Agents, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by\ndynamically and automatically creating and using small and efficient multiple\ndatabases, and at the same time, provide mechanism to update these small\nsignature databases at regular intervals using Mobile Agents",

    "publish": "2010-10-25T16:13:37Z", 
    "summary": "In a multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) mobile nodes communicate with\neach other forming a cooperative radio network. Security remains a major\nchallenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically\nchanging topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized\nmonitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the\ncurrently existing security algorithms designed for these networks are\ninsecure, in efficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes'\nmisbehaviour. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the\ncomplementary relationship between key distribution and misbehaviour detection\nfor developing an integrated security solution for MANETs. The redundancy of\nrouting information in ad hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable\nprotocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and\nByzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully co-operative, and\nthus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used\nfor choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",

    "summary": "We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and correctness,\nwithout assuming any bound on the number of corrupt participants. All protocols\nhave polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the\nprotocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first\nprotocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to\ncompute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that\nregardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned\nthrough the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation.\nUnfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in\nwhich case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the\ntally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the\ncommunication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and\nauthorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is\nalso limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single\nauthority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt\nauthority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final\nprotocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification\ntechnique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting\nthe protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding\nversions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.",

    "summary": "A protocol for computing a functionality is secure if an adversary in this\nprotocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give\ntheir inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality\nto all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair --\nall parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness\nis not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility,\nGordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure\ncomputation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they\nconstruct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either\ntheir domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon\nand Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols.\n  We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general\nfunctionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when\nthe number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties\nare corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is\ndeterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security\nparameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the\nrange is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the\nfunctionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the\nnumber of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the\nnegative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant,\n1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is\npolynomial.",

We\npropose an efficient scheme for generating fake network traffic to disguise the\nreal event notification. The efficiency of the scheme that provides statistical\nsource location anonymity is achieved by partitioning network nodes randomly\ninto several dummy source groups. Members of the same group collectively\nemulate both temporal and spatial distribution of the event. Under such\ndummy-traffic framework of the source anonymity protection, we aim to better\nmodel the global eavesdropper, especially her way of using statistical tests to\ndetect the real event, and to present the quality of the location protection as\nrelative to the adversary's strength. In addition, our approach aims to reduce\nthe per-event work spent to generate the fake traffic while, most importantly,\nproviding a guaranteed latency in reporting the event. The latency is\ncontrolled by decoupling the routing from the fake-traffic schedule. A good\ndummy source group design also provides a robust protection of event bursts.\nThis is achieved at the expense of the significant overhead as the number of\ndummy source groups must be increased to the reciprocal value of the false\nalarm parameter used in the statistical test. We believe that the proposed\nsource anonymity protection strategy, and the evaluation framework, are well\njustified by the abundance of the applications that monitor a rare event with\nknown temporal statistics, and uniform spatial distribution.",

    "summary": "As sensors become ever more prevalent, more and more information will be\ncollected about each of us. A longterm research question is how best to support\nbeneficial uses while preserving individual privacy. Presence systems are an\nemerging class of applications that support collaboration.

Because such presence data are sensitive, to\nachieve wide-spread adoption, sharing models must reflect the privacy and\nsharing preferences of the users. To reflect users' collaborative relationships\nand sharing desires, we introduce CollaPSE security, in which an individual has\nfull access to her own data, a third party processes the data without learning\nanything about the data values, and users higher up in the hierarchy learn only\nstatistical information about the employees under them.

    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently attracted a lot of interest in\nthe research community due their wide range of applications. Unfortunately,\nthese networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely\naffect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network\nis deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical\nbattlefield. Random failure of nodes and intentional compromise of nodes by an\ninsider attack in a WSN pose particularly difficult challenges to security\nengineers as these attacks cannot be defended by traditional cryptography-based\nmechanisms. In this paper, a security solution is proposed for detecting\ncompromised and faulty nodes in a WSN. The mechanism also isolates a\ncompromised node from the network so that it cannot participate in any network\nactivity. The proposed mechanism is based on misbehavior classification,\nbehaviour monitoring and trust management. It involves minimum computation and\ncommunication overhead and is ideally suited for a resource-constrained,\nhigh-integrity WSN.",

The mobility of the nodes and the fundamentally limited capacity of\nthe wireless medium, together with wireless transmission effects such as\nattenuation, multi-path propagation, and interference combine to create\nsig-nificant challenges for security in MANETs. Traditional cryptographic\nmecha-nisms such as authentication and encryption are not capable of handling\nsome kinds of attacks such as packet dropping by malicious nodes in MANETs.\nThis paper presents a mechanism for detecting malicious packet dropping attacks\nin MANETs. The mechanism is depends on a trust module on each node, which is\nbased on the reputation value computed for that node by its neighbors. The\nreputation value of a node is computed based on its packet forwarding behavior\nin the network.

To\nremedy the inefficiency of model checking compared with type system, we propose\nboth compact form and contracted form of self-composition.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the design of a dedicated homophonic coding for a class\nof communication systems which, in order to provide both reliability and\nsecurity, first encode the data before encrypting it, which is referred to as\nthe encoding-encryption paradigm. The considered systems employ\nerror-correction coding for reliability, a stream cipher for encryption, and\nhomophonic coding to enhance the protection of the key used in the stream\ncipher, on which relies the security of all the system transmissions. This\npaper presents a security evaluation of such systems from a computational\ncomplexity point of view, which serves as a source for establishing dedicated\nhomophonic code design criteria. The security evaluation shows that the\ncomputational complexity of recovering the secret key, given all the\ninformation an attacker could gather during passive attacks he can mount, is\nlower bounded by the complexity of the related LPN (Learning Parity in Noise)\nproblem in both the average and worst case. This gives guidelines to construct\na dedicated homophonic encoder which maximizes the complexity of the underlying\nLPN problem for a given encoding overhead. Finally, this paper proposes a\ngeneric homophonic coding strategy that fulfills the proposed design criteria\nand thus both enhances security while minimizing the induced overhead.",

Even within the\nphone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one\nanother, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its\nprivileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security\nmechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain\nof IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges\nof its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight\nsignature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be\nverified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in\nnetwork RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone\nwhen an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example\napplications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app\nwhich wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its\nhost.

    "publish": "2011-02-15T20:29:09Z", 
    "summary": "In this paper we discuss the ability of channel codes to enhance\ncryptographic secrecy. Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of\ndegrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is\nsimilar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific\npractical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the\nciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system\nsetup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through\nindependent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ\n(Automatic Repeat reQuest). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic\nlow-density parity-check codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper\nwith stopping sets in the decoder. Furthermore, the design amplifies errors\nwhen stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased\nbits correctly to avoid an expected error rate of one half in the ciphertext.\nWe extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that\nreduces the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood attack to that of a\nmessage-passing attack. We further extend security analysis to models with\nmultiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is\nenhanced in all these cases by exploiting properties of the physical-layer. The\nenhancement is accurately presented as a function of the degrees of freedom in\nthe eavesdropper's knowledge of the ciphertext, and is even shown to be present\nwhen eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers.",

    "publish": "2011-02-17T17:26:58Z", 
    "summary": "We explore the additional security obtained by noise at the physical layer in\na wiretap channel model setting. Security enhancements at the physical layer\nhave been proposed recently using a secrecy metric based on the degrees of\nfreedom that an attacker has with respect to the sent ciphertext. Prior work\nfocused on cases in which the wiretap channel could be modeled as statistically\nindependent packet erasure channels for the legitimate receiver and an\neavesdropper. In this paper, we go beyond the state-of-the-art by addressing\ncorrelated erasure events across the two communication channels. The resulting\nsecurity enhancement is presented as a function of the correlation coefficient\nand the erasure probabilities for both channels. It is shown that security\nimprovements are achievable by means of judicious physical-layer design even\nwhen the eavesdropper has a better channel than the legitimate receiver. The\nonly case in which this assertion may not hold is when erasures are highly\ncorrelated across channels. However, we are able to prove that correlation\ncannot nullify the expected security enhancement if the channel quality of the\nlegitimate receiver is strictly better than that of the eavesdropper.",

    "summary": "A bandwidth puzzle was recently proposed to defend against colluding\nadversaries in peer-to-peer networks. The colluding adversaries do not do\nactual work but claim to have uploaded contents for each other to gain free\ncredits from the system. The bandwidth puzzle guarantees that if the\nadversaries can solve the puzzle, they must have spent substantial bandwidth,\nthe size of which is comparable to the size of the contents they claim to have\nuploaded for each other. Therefore, the puzzle discourages the collusion. In\nthis paper, we study the performance of the bandwidth puzzle and give a lower\nbound on the average number of bits the adversaries must receive to be able to\nsolve the puzzles with a certain probability. We show that our bound is tight\nin the sense that there exists a strategy to approach this lower bound\nasymptotically within a small factor. The new bound gives better security\nguarantees than the existing bound, and can be used to guide better choices of\npuzzle parameters to improve the system performance.",

    "publish": "2011-03-29T10:22:32Z", 
    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and\nunique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor\nnodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost,\ninvisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and\nlimited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer\nattacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable\non WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel,\nuntrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and\nlimited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks;\nbut we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's\nconstraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs,\ndivide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them,\ninclude: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a\nwide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work\nenables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the\ngoal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this\npaper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms\nagainst the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to\nmanage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a new effective method for image encryption which employs\nmagnitude and phase manipulation using Differential Evolution (DE) approach.\nThe novelty of this work lies in deploying the concept of keyed discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) followed by DE operations for encryption purpose. To\nthis end, a secret key is shared between both encryption and decryption sides.\nFirstly two dimensional (2-D) keyed discrete Fourier transform is carried out\non the original image to be encrypted. Secondly crossover is performed between\ntwo components of the encrypted image, which are selected based on Linear\nFeedback Shift Register (LFSR) index generator. Similarly, keyed mutation is\nperformed on the real parts of a certain components selected based on LFSR\nindex generator. The LFSR index generator initializes it seed with the shared\nsecret key to ensure the security of the resulting indices. The process\nshuffles the positions of image pixels. A new image encryption scheme based on\nthe DE approach is developed which is composed with a simple diffusion\nmechanism. The deciphering process is an invertible process using the same key.\nThe resulting encrypted image is found to be fully distorted, resulting in\nincreasing the robustness of the proposed work. The simulation results validate\nthe proposed image encryption scheme.",

Finally, the performance of the proposed watermarking method\nis analyzed in terms of signal to noise ratio, mean opinion score and\nrobustness.

    "summary": "Modern distributed communication networks like the Internet and\ncensorship-resistant networks (also a part of the Internet) are characterized\nby nodes (users) interconnected with one another via communication links. In\nthis regard, the security of individual nodes depend not only on their own\nefforts, but also on the efforts and underlying connectivity structure of\nneighboring network nodes. By the term 'effort', we imply the amount of\ninvestments made by a user in security mechanisms like antivirus softwares,\nfirewalls, etc., to improve its security. However, often due to the large\nmagnitude of such networks, it is not always possible for nodes to have\ncomplete effort and connectivity structure information about all their neighbor\nnodes. Added to this is the fact that in many applications, the Internet users\nare selfish and are not willing to co-operate with other users on sharing\neffort information. In this paper, we adopt a non-cooperative game-theoretic\napproach to analyze individual user security in a communication network by\naccounting for both, the partial information that a network node possess about\nits underlying neighborhood connectivity structure, as well as the presence of\npositive externalities arising from efforts exerted by neighboring nodes. We\ninvestigate the equilibrium behavior of nodes and show 1) the existence of\nsymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria of efforts and 2) better connected nodes\nchoose lower efforts to exert but earn higher utilities with respect to\nsecurity improvement irrespective of the nature of node degree correlations\namongst the neighboring nodes.

Unfortunately, recent\nresearch has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk\nmounted by a running machine\\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the\ncold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using\nstate-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an\nattacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is\napplicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily\nsupposed to defend: an adversary with physical access.

Moreover, since no\nproposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all\ngeneral-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present\nLoop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel\ntechnique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer\ntheoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack,\nverify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present\nmeasurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is\nlimited to a slowdown of approximately 2x.

This paper\npresents a Data modification- based Framework for classification and evaluation\nof the privacy preserving data mining techniques. Based on our framework the\ntechniques are divided into two major groups, namely perturbation approach and\nanonymization approach. Also in proposed framework, eight functional criteria\nwill be used to analyze and analogically assessment of the techniques in these\ntwo major groups. The proposed framework provides a good basis for more\naccurate comparison of the given techniques to privacy preserving data mining.\nIn addition, this framework allows recognizing the overlapping amount for\ndifferent approaches and identifying modern approaches in this field.",

    "summary": "Double Blind Comparison is a new cryptographic primitive that allows a user\nwho is in possession of a ciphertext to determine if the corresponding\nplaintext is identical to the plaintext for a different ciphertext held by a\ndifferent user, but only if both users co-operate. Neither user knows anything\nabout the plaintexts corresponding to either ciphertext, and neither user\nlearns anything about the plaintexts as a result of the comparison, other than\nwhether the two plaintexts are identical. Neither user can determine whether\nthe plaintexts are equal without the other user's co-operation. Double Blind\nComparisons have potential application in Anonymous Credentials and the\nDatabase Aggregation Problem. This paper shows how Double Blind Comparisons can\nbe implemented using a Strong Associative One-Way Function (SAOWF). Proof of\nsecurity is given, making an additional assumption that the SAOWF is\nimplemented on a Group with Infeasible Inversion (GII), whose existence was\npostulated by Hohenberger and Molnar.",

This paper introduces a new cryptographic primitive,\nDouble Blind Comparisons, which allows two co-operating users, who each have an\nencrypted secret, to determine the equality or inequality of those two secrets,\neven though neither user can discover any information about what the secret is.\nThis paper also introduces a new problem in bilinear groups, conjectured to be\na hard problem. Assuming this conjecture, it is shown that neither user can\ndiscover any information about whether the secrets are equal, without the other\nuser's co-operation.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of detecting clones in wireless mobile adhoc\nnetworks. We assume that one of the devices of the network has been cloned.\nEverything, including certificates and secret keys. This can happen quite\neasily, because of a virus that immediately after sending all the content of\nthe infected device to the adversary destroys itself, or just because the owner\nhas left his device unattended for a few minutes in a hostile environment. The\nproblem is to detect this attack. We propose a solution in networks of mobile\ndevices carried by individuals. These networks are composed by nodes that have\nthe capability of using short-range communication technology like blue-tooth or\nWi-Fi, where nodes are carried by mobile users, and where links appear and\ndisappear according to the social relationships between the users. Our idea is\nto use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal\nsmart-phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the legitimate owner of the\ndevice and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks\nand Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol\nthat works very well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the\nnetwork that is part, or not very far, from the social community of the\noriginal device that has been cloned. Community Certificates work very well\nwhen the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen\ncredentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social\nnetwork from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an\nexcellent protection against this very strong attack. We prove our ideas and\nsolutions with extensive simulations in a real world scenario-with mobility\ntraces collected in a real life experiment",

We focus on the YAFFS file system, widely used on Android smartphones.\nWe show that these systems provide no temporal guarantees on data deletion and\nthat deleted data still persists for nearly 44 hours with average phone use and\nindefinitely if the phone is not used after the deletion. Furthermore, we show\nthat file overwriting and encryption, methods commonly used for secure deletion\non block-structured file systems, do not ensure data deletion in log-structured\nfile systems.\n  We propose three mechanisms for secure deletion on log-structured file\nsystems. Purging is a user-level mechanism that guarantees secure deletion at\nthe cost of negligible device wear. Ballooning is a user-level mechanism that\nruns continuously and gives probabilistic improvements to secure deletion. Zero\noverwriting is a kernel-level mechanism that guarantees immediate secure\ndeletion without device wear. We implement these mechanisms on Nexus One\nsmartphones and show that they succeed in secure deletion and neither\nprohibitively reduce the longevity of the flash memory nor noticeably reduce\nthe device's battery lifetime.

To ensure the perfect secrecy (PS), the mutual information is often\nused to evaluate the statistical independence between a message and a\ncryptogram. On the other hand, in order to recognize the information\ntheoretically secure encryptions and computationally secure ones\ncomprehensively, it is necessary to reconsider the notion of PS in terms of the\nvariational distance. However, based on the variational distance, three kinds\nof definitions for PS are naturally introduced, but their relations are not\nknown. In this paper, we clarify that one of three definitions for PS with the\nvariational distance, which is a straightforward extension of Shannon's perfect\nsecrecy, is stronger than the others, and the weaker two definitions of PS are\nessentially equivalent to the statistical versions of indistinguishability and\nsemantic security.",

    "summary": "Mobile application markets facilitate the distribution of applications and\nthus help developers advertise their work and customers find useful\napplications. In addition, the operators of mobile application markets can\ncontrol the quality and the content of the applications. These markets are\ngrowing rapidly with more than 300'000 application in the App Store of Apple\nand more than 100'000 in the Android Market of Google. This is not only a great\nopportunity for phone manufacturers to earn money but also for indie developers\n(single or small teams of developers with small financial support) who can thus\nhave a great distribution channel. Steve Demeter, the Trim game developer for\niPhone, became millionaire with a single puzzle game . Obviously, as new\nmarkets generate a lot of money, the temptation of misbehavior to steal part of\nthe benefits is big. The first famous case was the one of Molinker who\nself-rated his applications with 5 stars to pump up his ranking in order to\nincrease its revenue stream. In this report, we will consider the problem of\nmisbehavior in mobile application markets. We will investigate multiple attacks\nby misbehaving developers, users or network operators that aim at breaking\nrules for their own benefit, managing to outwit the operators' control on which\napplications can be installed. We notably suggest novel attacks that may affect\nmobile markets in the future: in particular, we show that it is possible to get\nrevenue for applications created by someone else, trick a user to download and\nbuy an application and new ways to pump up an application's ranking. We will\nalso discuss possible solutions against spyware applications and cheating\ndeveloper",

    "publish": "2011-07-08T13:14:21Z", 
    "summary": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an attractive alternative to\nconventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate\nfor implementation on constrained devices where the major computational\nresources i.e. speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication\nprotocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels\nwith traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. Moreover, in\nseveral application areas such as person identification and eVoting, it is\nfrequently required of entities to prove knowledge of some fact without\nrevealing this knowledge. Such proofs of knowledge are called Zero Knowledge\nInteractive Proofs (ZKIP) and involve interactions between two communicating\nparties, the Prover and the Verifier. In a ZKIP, the Prover demonstrates the\npossesion of some information (e.g. authentication information) to the Verifier\nwithout disclosing it. In this paper, we focus on the application of ZKIP\nprotocols on resource constrained devices. We study well-established ZKIP\nprotocols based on the discrete logarithm problem and we transform them under\nthe ECC setting. Then, we implement the proposed protocols on Wiselib, a\ngeneric and open source algorithmic library. Finally, we present a thorough\nevaluation of the protocols on two popular hardware platforms equipped with low\nend microcontrollers (Jennic JN5139, TI MSP430) and 802.15.4 RF transceivers,\nin terms of code size, execution time, message size and energy requirements. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of implementing and\nevaluating ZKIP protocols with emphasis on low-end devices. This work's results\ncan be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and\nprivacy in their applications.",

    "publish": "2011-07-09T22:31:10Z", 
    "summary": "With the advent of mobile computing, location-based services have recently\ngained popularity. Many applications use the location provenance of users,\ni.e., the chronological history of the users' location for purposes ranging\nfrom access control, authentication, information sharing, and evaluation of\npolicies. However, location provenance is subject to tampering and collusion\nattacks by malicious users. In this paper, we examine the secure location\nprovenance problem. We introduce a witness-endorsed scheme for generating\ncollusion-resistant location proofs. We also describe two efficient and\nprivacy-preserving schemes for protecting the integrity of the chronological\norder of location proofs. These schemes, based on hash chains and Bloom filters\nrespectively, allow users to prove the order of any arbitrary subsequence of\ntheir location history to auditors. Finally, we present experimental results\nfrom our proof-of-concept implementation on the Android platform and show that\nour schemes are practical in today's mobile devices.",

To\nbetter understand these policies, we conducted a set of experiments on major\nsearch engines employed by Internet users in China, issuing queries against a\nvariety of different words: some neutral, some with names of important people,\nsome political, and some pornographic. We conducted these queries, in Chinese,\nagainst Baidu, Google (including google.cn, before it was terminated), Yahoo!,\nand Bing. We found remarkably aggressive filtering of pornographic terms, in\nsome cases causing non-pornographic terms which use common characters to also\nbe filtered. We also found that names of prominent activists and organizers as\nwell as top political and military leaders, were also filtered in whole or in\npart. In some cases, we found search terms which we believe to be\n\"blacklisted\". In these cases, the only results that appeared, for any of them,\ncame from a short \"whitelist\" of sites owned or controlled directly by the\nChinese government. By repeating observations over a long observation period,\nwe also found that the keyword blocking policies of the Great Firewall of China\nvary over time.

    "summary": "Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different\ntypes of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, and botnets. To reduce the\nprobability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense\nmechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does\nnot completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of\nresidual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality,\nan Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to\nnon-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware\ncrash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by\na naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks\nonly due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an\nInternet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard\noptimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to\nbe sub-optimal for himself. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing\ncyber-insurance solutions when a user faces risks due to both, security as well\nas non-security related failures. We propose \\emph{Aegis}, a novel\ncyber-insurance model in which the user accepts a fraction \\emph{(strictly\npositive)} of loss recovery on himself and transfers rest of the loss recovery\non the cyber-insurance agency. We mathematically show that given an option,\nInternet users would prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-insurance\ncontracts, under all premium types. This result firmly establishes the\nnon-existence of traditional cyber-insurance markets when Aegis contracts are\noffered to users.",

In This paper we proposed a novel algorithm\nto detect the intruders, who's trying to gain access to the network using the\npackets header parameters such as; source/destination address,\nsource/destination port, and protocol without the need to inspect each packet\ncontent looking for signatures/patterns. However, the \"Packet Header Matching\"\nalgorithm enhances the overall speed of the matching process between the\nincoming packet headers against the rule set. We ran the proposed algorithm to\nproof the proposed concept in coping with the traffic arrival speeds and the\nvarious bandwidth demands. The achieved results were of significant enhancement\nof the overall performance in terms of detection speed.",

In this paper we\nexamine the characteristics of phishing and technology used by Phishers. In\norder to counter anti-phishing technology, phishers change their mode of\noperation; therefore a continuous evaluation of phishing only helps us combat\nphisher effectiveness. In our study, we collected seven hundred thousand spam\nfrom a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to\nFebruary 2009. From the collected data, we identified different kinds of\nphishing scams and mode of operation. Our observation shows that phishers are\ndynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software\nvulnerabilities. We believe that this study will develop more efficient\nanti-phishing methodologies. Based on our analysis, we developed an\nanti-phishing methodology and implemented in our network. The results show that\nthis approach is highly effective to prevent phishing attacks.

Cryptovirology is the study of applications\nof cryptography to build the malicious software. It is an investigation, how\nmodern cryptographic tools and paradigms can be used to strengthen, develop and\nimprove new malicious software attacks.

This paper presents the idea of\n\"Cryptovirology\" which introduce a twist on how cryptography can also be used\noffensively. Being offensive means, it can be used to mount extortion based\nattacks that cause loss of access to information, loss of confidentiality, and\ninformation leakage, tasks which cryptography usually prevents. Also analyze\nthreats and attacks that misuse of cryptography can cause when combined with\nfraudulent software (viruses, Trojans).

    "summary": "The very nature of operations in peer-to-peer systems such as BitTorrent\nexposes information about participants to their peers. Nodes desiring\nanonymity, therefore, often chose to route their peer-to-peer traffic through\nanonymity relays, such as Tor. Unfortunately, these relays have little\nincentive for contribution and struggle to scale with the high loads that P2P\ntraffic foists upon them. We propose a novel modification for BitTorrent that\nwe call the BitTorrent Anonymity Marketplace. Peers in our system trade in k\nswarms obscuring the actual intent of the participants. But because peers can\ncross-trade torrents, the k-1 cover traffic can actually serve a useful\npurpose. This creates a system wherein a neighbor cannot determine if a node\nactually wants a given torrent, or if it is only using it as leverage to get\nthe one it really wants. In this paper, we present our design, explore its\noperation in simulation, and analyze its effectiveness. We demonstrate that the\nupload and download characteristics of cover traffic and desired torrents are\nstatistically difficult to distinguish.",

    "summary": "In order to determine the user's trust is a growing concern for ensuring\nprivacy and security in a cloud computing environment. In cloud, user's data is\nstored in one or more remote server(s) which poses more security challenges for\nthe system. One of the most important concerns is to protect user's sensitive\ninformation from other users and hackers that may cause data leakage in cloud\nstorage. Having this security challenge in mind, this paper focuses on the\ndevelopment of a more secure cloud environment, to determine the trust of the\nservice requesting authorities by using a novel VM (Virtual Machine) monitoring\nsystem. Moreover, this research aims towards proposing a new trusted and\ncollaborative agent-based two-tier framework, titled WAY (Who Are You?), to\nprotect cloud resources. The framework can be used to provide security in\nnetwork, infrastructure, as well as data storage in a heterogeneous cloud\nplatform. If the trust updating policy is based on network activities, then the\nframework can provide network security. Similarly, it provides storage security\nby monitoring unauthorized access activities by the Cloud Service Users (CSU).\nInfrastructure security can be provided by monitoring the use of privileged\ninstructions within the isolated VMs. The uniqueness of the proposed security\nsolution lies in the fact that it ensures security and privacy both at the\nservice provider level as well as at the user level in a cloud environment.",

    "summary": "Recent work in traffic analysis has shown that traffic patterns leaked\nthrough side channels can be used to recover important semantic information.\nFor instance, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website,\na user is accessing simply by monitoring the packet size distribution. We show\nthat traffic analysis is even a greater threat to privacy than previously\nthought by introducing a new attack that can be carried out remotely. In\nparticular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need\nto directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can gain sufficient\ninformation by sending probes from a far-off vantage point that exploits a\nqueuing side channel in routers. To demonstrate the threat of such remote\ntraffic analysis, we study a remote website detection attack that works against\nhome broadband users. Because the remotely observed traffic patterns are more\nnoisy than those obtained using previous schemes based on direct local traffic\nmonitoring, we take a dynamic time warping (DTW) based approach to detecting\nfingerprints from the same website. As a new twist on website fingerprinting,\nwe consider a website detection attack, where the attacker aims to find out\nwhether a user browses a particular web site, and its privacy implications. We\nshow experimentally that, although the success of the attack is highly\nvariable, depending on the target site, for some sites very low error rates. We\nalso show how such website detection can be used to deanonymize message board\nusers.",

As with\ntraditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and\na platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication\nhelps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from\nprevious designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks,\nand in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount\nof state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings.\nX-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and\nkeeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle,\nproviding a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design\nwith analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social\nnetworking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the\ninsertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we\nshow this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the\nperformance of honest nodes. Moreover, our algorithms are efficient, maintain\nlow stretch, and avoid hot spots in the network. We validate our design with a\nPlanetLab implementation and a Facebook plugin.",

    "publish": "2011-09-05T21:54:23Z", 
    "summary": "Collaborative spectrum sensing can significantly improve the detection\nperformance of secondary unlicensed users (SUs). However, the performance of\ncollaborative sensing is vulnerable to sensing data falsification attacks,\nwhere malicious SUs (attackers) submit manipulated sensing reports to mislead\nthe fusion center's decision on spectrum occupancy. Moreover, attackers may not\nfollow the fusion center's decision regarding their spectrum access. This paper\nconsiders a challenging attack scenario where multiple rational attackers\noverhear all honest SUs' sensing reports and cooperatively maximize attackers'\naggregate spectrum utilization. We show that, without attack-prevention\nmechanisms, honest SUs are unable to transmit over the licensed spectrum, and\nthey may further be penalized by the primary user for collisions due to\nattackers' aggressive transmissions. To prevent such attacks, we propose two\nnovel attack-prevention mechanisms with direct and indirect punishments. The\nkey idea is to identify collisions to the primary user that should not happen\nif all SUs follow the fusion center's decision. Unlike prior work, the proposed\nsimple mechanisms do not require the fusion center to identify and exclude\nattackers. The direct punishment can effectively prevent all attackers from\nbehaving maliciously. The indirect punishment is easier to implement and can\nprevent attacks when the attackers care enough about their long-term reward.",

    "summary": "Safeguarding online communications using public key cryptography is a\nwell-established practice today, but with the increasing reliance on\n`faceless', solely online entities one of the core aspects of public key\ncryptography is becoming a substantial problem in practice: Who can we trust to\nintroduce us to and vouch for some online party whose public key we see for the\nfirst time? Most existing certification models lack flexibility and have come\nunder attack repeatedly in recent years, and finding practical improvements has\na high priority.\n  We propose that the real-world concept of a notary or certifying witness can\nbe adapted to today's online environment quite easily, and that such a system\nwhen combined with peer-to-peer technologies for defense in depth is a viable\nalternative to monolithic trust infrastructures.\n  Instead of trusting assurances from a single party, integrity certifications\n(and data replication) can be provided among a group of independent parties in\na peer-to-peer fashion. As the likelihood of all such assurance providers being\nsubverted at the very same time is very much less than that of a single party,\noverall robustness is improved.\n  This paper presents the design and the implementation of our prototype online\nnotary system where independent computer notaries provide integrity\ncertification and highly-available replicated storage, and discusses how this\nonline notary system handles some common threat patterns.",

    "summary": "Anonymity networks hide user identities with the help of relayed anonymity\nrouters. However, the state-of-the-art anonymity networks do not provide an\neffective trust model. As a result, users cannot circumvent malicious or\nvulnerable routers, thus making them susceptible to malicious router based\nattacks (e.g., correlation attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel social\nnetwork based trust model to help anonymity networks circumvent malicious\nrouters and obtain secure anonymity. In particular, we design an input\nindependent fuzzy model to determine trust relationships between friends based\non qualitative and quantitative social attributes, both of which can be readily\nobtained from existing social networks. Moreover, we design an algorithm for\npropagating trust over an anonymity network. We integrate these two elements in\nSTor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying\nthe Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the\neffectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have\ndemonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based\ncircuits in a distributed way. Although the design of STor is based on Tor\nnetwork, the social network based trust model can be adopted by other anonymity\nnetworks.",

Our protocol\nis related to the Stern identification scheme but has a reduced communication\ncost compared to previous code-based zero-knowledge schemes, moreover our\nscheme permits to obtain a very low size of public key and secret key. The\ncontribution of this paper is twofold, first we propose a variation on the\nStern authentication scheme which permits to decrease asymptotically the\ncheating probability to 1/2 rather than 2/3 (and very close to 1/2 in practice)\nbut with less communication. Our solution is based on deriving new challenges\nfrom the secret key through cyclic shifts of the initial public key syndrome; a\nnew proof of soundness for this case is given Secondly we propose a new way to\ndeal with hashed commitments in zero-knowledge schemes based on Stern's scheme,\nso that in terms of communication, on the average, only one hash value is sent\nrather than two or three. Overall our new scheme has the good features of\nhaving a zero-knowledge security proof based on well known hard problem of\ncoding theory, a small size of secret and public key (a few hundred bits), a\nsmall calculation complexity, for an overall communication cost of 19kb for\nauthentication (for a $2^{16}$ security) and a signature of size of 93kb\n(11.5kB) (for security $2^{80}$), an improvement of 40% compared to previous\nschemes based on coding theory.",

    "summary": "In this thesis we consider the problem of information hiding in the scenarios\nof interactive systems, statistical disclosure control, and refinement of\nspecifications. We apply quantitative approaches to information flow in the\nfirst two cases, and we propose improvements for the usual solutions based on\nprocess equivalences for the third case. In the first scenario we consider the\nproblem of defining the information leakage in interactive systems where\nsecrets and observables can alternate during the computation and influence each\nother. We show that the information-theoretic approach which interprets such\nsystems as (simple) noisy channels is not valid. The principle can be recovered\nif we consider channels with memory and feedback. We also propose the use of\ndirected information from input to output as the real measure of leakage in\ninteractive systems. In the second scenario we consider the problem of\nstatistical disclosure control, which concerns how to reveal accurate\nstatistics about a set of respondents while preserving the privacy of\nindividuals. We focus on the concept of differential privacy, a notion that has\nbecome very popular in the database community. We show how to model the query\nsystem in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion\nof differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage.In the third scenario\nwe address the problem of using process equivalences to characterize\ninformation-hiding properties. We show that, in the presence of nondeterminism,\nthis approach may rely on the assumption that the scheduler \"works for the\nbenefit of the protocol\", and this is often not a safe assumption. We present a\nformalism in which we can specify admissible schedulers and, correspondingly,\nsafe versions of complete-trace equivalence and bisimulation, and we show that\nsafe equivalences can be used to establish information-hiding properties.",

    "publish": "2011-11-16T10:20:46Z", 
    "summary": "Even though passwords are the most convenient means of authentication, they\nbring along themselves the threat of dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks may\nbe of two kinds: online and offline. While offline dictionary attacks are\npossible only if the adversary is able to collect data for a successful\nprotocol execution by eavesdropping on the communication channel and can be\nsuccessfully countered using public key cryptography, online dictionary attacks\ncan be performed by anyone and there is no satisfactory solution to counter\nthem. This paper presents a new authentication protocol which is called\nCompChall (computational challenge). The proposed protocol uses only one way\nhash functions as the building blocks and attempts to eliminate online\ndictionary attacks by implementing a challenge-response system. This\nchallenge-response system is designed in a fashion that it does not pose any\ndifficulty to a genuine user but is time consuming and computationally\nintensive for an adversary trying to launch a large number of login requests\nper unit time as in the case of an online dictionary attack. The protocol is\nstateless and thus less vulnerable to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.",

    "summary": "We propose a new homomorphic encryption scheme based on the hardness of\ndecoding under independent random noise from certain affine families of codes.\nUnlike in previous lattice-based homomorphic encryption schemes, where the\nmessage is hidden in the noisy part of the ciphertext, our scheme carries the\nmessage in the affine part of the transformation and applies noise only to\nachieve security. Our scheme can tolerate noise of arbitrary magnitude, as long\nas the noise vector has sufficiently small hamming weight (and its entries are\nindependent).\n  Our design achieves \"proto-homomorphic\" properties in an elementary manner:\nmessage addition and multiplication are emulated by pointwise addition and\nmultiplication of the ciphertext vectors. Moreover, the extremely simple nature\nof our decryption makes the scheme easily amenable to bootstrapping. However,\nsome complications are caused by the inherent presence of noticeable encryption\nerror. Our main technical contribution is the development of two new techniques\nfor handling this error in the homomorphic evaluation process.\n  We also provide a definitional framework for homomorphic encryption that may\nbe useful elsewhere.",

    "summary": "The popularity of Internet usage although increases exponentially, it is\nincapable of providing the security for exchange of confidential data between\nthe users. As a result, several cryptosystems for encryption of data and images\nhave been developed for secured transmission over Internet. In this work, a\nscheme for Image encryption/decryption based on Vector Quantization (VQ) has\nbeen proposed that concurrently encodes the images for compression and shuffles\nthe codebook and the index matrix using pseudorandom sequences for encryption.\nThe processing time of the proposed scheme is much less than the other\ncryptosystems, because it does not use any traditional cryptographic\noperations, and instead it performs swapping between the contents of the\ncodebook with respect to a random sequence, which resulted an indirect\nshuffling of the contents of the index matrix. It may be noted that the\nsecurity of the proposed cryptosystem depends on the generation and the\nexchange of the random sequences used. Since the generation of truly random\nsequences are not practically feasible, we simulate the proposed scheme using\nMATLAB, where its operators like rand(method, seed), randperm(n) has been used\nto generate pseudorandom sequences and it has been seen that the proposed\ncryptosystem shows the expected performance.",

    "summary": "This paper describes the problem of securing data by making it disappear\nafter some time limit, making it impossible for it to be recovered by an\nunauthorized party. This method is in response to the need to keep the data\nsecured and to protect the privacy of archived data on the servers, Cloud and\nPeer-to-Peer architectures. Due to the distributed nature of these\narchitectures, it is impossible to destroy the data completely. So, we store\nthe data by applying encryption and then manage the key, which is easier to do\nas the key is small and it can be hidden in the DHT (Distributed hash table).\nEven if the keys in the DHT and the encrypted data were compromised, the data\nwould still be secure. This paper describes existing solutions, points to their\nlimitations and suggests improvements with a new secure architecture. We\nevaluated and executed this architecture on the Java platform and proved that\nit is more secure than other architectures.",

    "summary": "The design of authentication protocols, for online banking services in\nparticular and any service that is of sensitive nature in general, is quite\nchallenging. Indeed, enforcing security guarantees has overhead thus imposing\nadditional computation and design considerations that do not always meet\nusability and user requirements. On the other hand, relaxing assumptions and\nrigorous security design to improve the user experience can lead to security\nbreaches that can harm the users' trust in the system.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate how careful visualization design can enhance\nnot only the security but also the usability of the authentication process. To\nthat end, we propose a family of visualized authentication protocols, a\nvisualized transaction verification, and a \"decryptable to your eyes only\"\nprotocol. Through rigorous analysis, we verify that our protocols are immune to\nmany of the challenging authentication attacks applicable in the literature.\nFurthermore, using an extensive case study on a prototype of our protocols, we\nhighlight the potential of our approach for real-world deployment: we were able\nto achieve a high level of usability while satisfying stringent security\nrequirements.",

    "publish": "2011-12-12T18:24:21Z", 
    "summary": "The Internet and its current information culture of preserving all kinds of\ndata cause severe problems with privacy. Most of today's Internet users,\nespecially teenagers, publish various kinds of sensitive information, yet\nwithout recognizing that revealing this information might be detrimental to\ntheir future life and career. Unflattering images that can be openly accessed\nnow and in the future, e.g., by potential employers, constitute a particularly\nimportant such privacy concern. We have developed a novel, fast, and scalable\nsystem called X-pire! that allows users to set an expiration date for images in\nsocial networks (e.g., Facebook and Flickr) and on static websites, without\nrequiring any form of additional interaction with these web pages. Once the\nexpiration date is reached, the images become unavailable. Moreover, the\npublishing user can dynamically prolong or shorten the expiration dates of his\nimages later, and even enforce instantaneous expiration. Rendering the approach\npossible for social networks crucially required us to develop a novel technique\nfor embedding encrypted information within JPEG files in a way that survives\nJPEG compression, even for highly optimized implementations of JPEG\npost-processing with their various idiosyncrasies as commonly used in such\nnetworks. We have implemented our system and conducted performance measurements\nto demonstrate its robustness and efficiency.",

    "summary": "We consider user-private information retrieval (UPIR), an interesting\nalternative to private information retrieval (PIR) introduced by Domingo-Ferrer\net al. In UPIR, the database knows which records have been retrieved, but does\nnot know the identity of the query issuer. The goal of UPIR is to disguise user\nprofiles from the database. Domingo-Ferrer et al.\\ focus on using a\npeer-to-peer community to construct a UPIR scheme, which we term P2P UPIR. In\nthis paper, we establish a strengthened model for P2P UPIR and clarify the\nprivacy goals of such schemes using standard terminology from the field of\nprivacy research. In particular, we argue that any solution providing privacy\nagainst the database should attempt to minimize any corresponding loss of\nprivacy against other users. We give an analysis of existing schemes, including\na new attack by the database. Finally, we introduce and analyze two new\nprotocols. Whereas previous work focuses on a special type of combinatorial\ndesign known as a configuration, our protocols make use of more general\ndesigns. This allows for flexibility in protocol set-up, allowing for a choice\nbetween having a dynamic scheme (in which users are permitted to enter and\nleave the system), or providing increased privacy against other users.",

    "summary": "Researchers have proposed formal definitions of quantitative information flow\nbased on information theoretic notions such as the Shannon entropy, the min\nentropy, the guessing entropy, belief, and channel capacity. This paper\ninvestigates the hardness of precisely checking the quantitative information\nflow of a program according to such definitions. More precisely, we study the\n\"bounding problem\" of quantitative information flow, defined as follows: Given\na program M and a positive real number q, decide if the quantitative\ninformation flow of M is less than or equal to q. We prove that the bounding\nproblem is not a k-safety property for any k (even when q is fixed, for the\nShannon-entropy-based definition with the uniform distribution), and therefore\nis not amenable to the self-composition technique that has been successfully\napplied to checking non-interference. We also prove complexity theoretic\nhardness results for the case when the program is restricted to loop-free\nboolean programs. Specifically, we show that the problem is PP-hard for all\ndefinitions, showing a gap with non-interference which is coNP-complete for the\nsame class of programs. The paper also compares the results with the recently\nproved results on the comparison problems of quantitative information flow.",

Moreover, as far as we know,\nthe use of formal methodologies for the verification of security properties of\ncommunication protocols isn't yet a common practice. We propose here a\nmethodology to fill this gap, i.e., to analyse both the security of the\nproposed protocol and the pertinence of the underlying premises. In this\nconcern, we propose the definition and formal evaluation of a protocol for the\ndistribution of digital identities. Once distributed, these identities can be\nused to verify integrity and source of information. We base our security\nanalysis on tools for automatic verification of security protocols widely\naccepted by the scientific community, and on the principles they are based\nupon. In addition, it is assumed perfect cryptographic primitives in order to\nfocus the analysis on the exchange of protocol messages. The main property of\nour protocol is the incorporation of tickets, created using digests of chaos\nbased nonces (numbers used only once) and users' personal data. Combined with a\nmultichannel authentication scheme with some previous knowledge, these tickets\nprovide security during the whole protocol by univocally linking each\nregistering user with a single request.

    "publish": "2012-01-10T10:23:37Z", 
    "summary": "Pushback is a mechanism for defending against Distributed Denial-of-Service\n(DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but\nbecause most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the\nrouters. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially\ndrop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also\nnotified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to\nroute legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been\nadvocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In\norder to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the\nclient that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it\nis assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.\nIf the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it\nincreases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows\nthe traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before\nreaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback\nand puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback\ntechnique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS\nattacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed\nback to the core routers rather than having at the victim. The router based\nclient puzzle mechanism checks the host system whether it is legitimate or not\nby providing a puzzle to be solved by the suspected host.",

    "summary": "Distributed denial-of-service attacks on public servers have recently become\na serious problem. To assure that network services will not be interrupted and\nmore effective defense mechanisms to protect against malicious traffic,\nespecially SYN floods. One problem in detecting SYN flood traffic is that\nserver nodes or firewalls cannot distinguish the SYN packets of normal TCP\nconnections from those of a SYN flood attack. Another problem is single-point\ndefenses (e.g. firewalls) lack the scalability needed to handle an increase in\nthe attack traffic. We have designed a new defense mechanism to detect the SYN\nflood attacks. First, we introduce a mechanism for detecting SYN flood traffic\nmore accurately by taking into consideration the time variation of arrival\ntraffic. We investigate the statistics regarding the arrival rates of both\nnormal TCP SYN packets and SYN flood attack packets. We then describe a new\ndetection mechanism based on these statistics. Through the trace driven\napproach defense nodes which receive the alert messages can identify legitimate\ntraffic and block malicious traffic by delegating SYN/ACK packets.",

    "summary": "Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different\ntypes of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, spams, and botnets. To reduce\nthe probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in traditional\nsecurity mechanisms like anti-virus and anti-spam software, sometimes also\nknown as \\emph{self-defense} mechanisms. However, according to security\nexperts, such software (and their subsequent advancements) will not completely\neliminate risk. Recent research efforts have considered the problem of residual\nrisk elimination by proposing the idea of \\emph{cyber-insurance}. In this\nregard, an important research problem is resolving information asymmetry issues\nassociated with cyber-insurance contracts. In this paper we propose\n\\emph{three} mechanisms to resolve information asymmetry in cyber-insurance.\nOur mechanisms are based on the \\emph{Principal-Agent} (PA) model in\nmicroeconomic theory. We show that (1) optimal cyber-insurance contracts\ninduced by our mechanisms only provide partial coverage to the insureds. This\nensures greater self-defense efforts on the part of the latter to protect their\ncomputing systems, which in turn increases overall network security, (2) the\nlevel of deductible per network user contract increases in a concave manner\nwith the topological degree of the user, and (3) a market for cyber-insurance\ncan be made to exist in the presence of monopolistic insurers under effective\nmechanism design. Our methodology is applicable to any distributed network\nscenario in which a framework for cyber-insurance can be implemented.",

    "summary": "In recent years, researchers have proposed \\emph{cyber-insurance} as a\nsuitable risk-management technique for enhancing security in Internet-like\ndistributed systems. However, amongst other factors, information asymmetry\nbetween the insurer and the insured, and the inter-dependent and correlated\nnature of cyber risks have contributed in a big way to the failure of\ncyber-insurance markets. Security experts have argued in favor of operating\nsystem (OS) platform switching (ex., from Windows to Unix-based OSs) or secure\nOS adoption as being one of the techniques that can potentially mitigate the\nproblems posing a challenge to successful cyber-insurance markets. In this\nregard we model OS platform switching dynamics using a \\emph{social gossip}\nmechanism and study three important questions related to the nature of the\ndynamics, for Internet-like distributed systems: (i) which type of networks\nshould cyber-insurers target for insuring?, (ii) what are the bounds on the\nasymptotic performance level of a network, where the performance parameter is\nan average function of the long-run individual user willingness to adopt secure\nOSs?, and (iii) how can cyber-insurers use the topological information of their\nclients to incentivize/reward them during offering contracts? Our analysis is\nimportant to a profit-minded cyber-insurer, who wants to target the right\nnetwork, design optimal contracts to resolve information asymmetry problems,\nand at the same time promote the increase of overall network security through\nincreasing secure OS adoption amongst users.",

Theoretically, every linear code can be used\nto construct secret sharing schemes. However, in general, determining the\naccess structures of the schemes based on linear codes is very hard. This paper\nproposed the concept of minimal linear code, which makes the determination of\nthe access structures of the schemes based on the duals of minimal linear codes\neasier. It is proved that the shortening codes of minimal linear codes are also\nminimal ones. Then the conditions whether several types of irreducible cyclic\ncodes are minimal linear codes are presented. Furthermore, the access\nstructures of secret sharing schemes based on the duals of minimal linear codes\nare studied, and these access structures in specific examples are obtained\nthrough programming.",

    "summary": "Lossy trapdoor functions, introduced by Peikert and Waters (STOC'08), have\nreceived a lot of attention in the last years, because of their wide range of\napplications in theoretical cryptography. The notion has been recently extended\nto the identity-based setting by Bellare et al. (Eurocrypt'12). We provide one\nmore step in this direction, by considering the notion of hierarchical\nidentity-based (lossy) trapdoor functions (HIB-TDFs). Hierarchical\nidentity-based cryptography has proved very useful both for practical\napplications and to establish theoretical relations with other cryptographic\nprimitives.\n  The notion of security for IB-TDFs put forward by Bellare et al. easily\nextends to the hierarchical scenario, but an (H)IB-TDF secure in this sense is\nnot known to generically imply other related primitives with security against\nadaptive-id adversaries, not even IND-ID-CPA secure encryption. Our first\ncontribution is to define a new security property for (H)IB-TDFs. We show that\nfunctions satisfying this property imply secure cryptographic primitives in the\nadaptive identity-based setting: these include encryption schemes with semantic\nsecurity under chosen-plaintext attacks, deterministic encryption schemes, and\n(non-adaptive) hedged encryption schemes that maintain some security when\nmessages are encrypted using randomness of poor quality.\n  Then, we describe the first pairing-based HIB-TDF realization. Our HIB-TDF\nconstruction is based on techniques that differ from those of Bellare et al. in\nthat it uses a hierarchical predicate encryption scheme as a key ingredient.\nThe resulting HIB-TDF is proved to satisfy the new security definition, against\neither selective or, for hierarchies of constant depth, adaptive adversaries.",

Our approach is\nto leverage the botnet detection work carried out by some organizations to\neasily locate collaborating bots elsewhere. We created BotMosaic as a\ncountermeasure to IRC-based botnets. BotMosaic relies on captured bot instances\ncontrolled by a watermarker, who inserts a particular pattern into their\nnetwork traffic. This pattern can then be detected at a very low cost by client\norganizations and the watermark can be tuned to provide acceptable\nfalse-positive rates. A novel feature of the watermark is that it is inserted\ncollaboratively into the flows of multiple captured bots at once, in order to\nensure the signal is strong enough to be detected. BotMosaic can also be used\nto detect stepping stones and to help trace back to the botmaster. It is\ncontent agnostic and can operate on encrypted traffic.

Passive traffic analysis can link flows but requires long periods\nof observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow\nwatermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow\nwatermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of\nusing a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the\nwatermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose\nthe first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that\nimproves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller\nthan previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on\nnetwork flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well\nas the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using\nhypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the\npassive approach we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis\nperform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however, the\nRAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the\ncase of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind\nwatermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have\nsimilar scalability constraints.

    "summary": "Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a very popular access control model, for\nlong time investigated and widely deployed in the security architecture of\ndifferent enterprises. To implement RBAC, roles have to be firstly identified\nwithin the considered organization. Usually the process of (automatically)\ndefining the roles in a bottom up way, starting from the permissions assigned\nto each user, is called {\\it role mining}. In literature, the role mining\nproblem has been formally analyzed and several techniques have been proposed in\norder to obtain a set of valid roles.\n  Recently, the problem of defining different kind of constraints on the number\nand the size of the roles included in the resulting role set has been\naddressed. In this paper we provide a formal definition of the role mining\nproblem under the cardinality constraint, i.e. restricting the maximum number\nof permissions that can be included in a role. We discuss formally the\ncomputational complexity of the problem and propose a novel heuristic.\nFurthermore we present experimental results obtained after the application of\nthe proposed heuristic on both real and synthetic datasets, and compare the\nresulting performance to previous proposals",

This work constitutes the first\nsecurity analysis of LTE AKA to date and the first computationally sound\nanalysis of UMTS AKA. Our work is the first formal analysis to consider\nmessages that are sent in the core network, where we take into account details\nof the carrying protocol (i.e., MAP or Diameter) and of the mechanism for\nsecure transport (i.e., MAPsec/TCAPsec or IPsec ESP). Moreover, we report on a\ndeficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the\nspecifications of the core network security (called network domain security),\nwhich may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker\nnot only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the\nprotocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA\nrun over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward\napplication of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and\nLTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently\nlong session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication\nproperties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used\nprimitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions.",

    "summary": "Every time the customer (individual or company) has to release personal\ninformation to its service provider (e.g., an online store or a cloud computing\nprovider), it faces a trade-off between the benefits gained (enhanced or\ncheaper services) and the risks it incurs (identity theft and fraudulent uses).\nThe amount of personal information released is the major decision variable in\nthat trade-off problem, and has a proxy in the maximum loss the customer may\nincur. We find the conditions for a unique optimal solution to exist for that\nproblem as that maximizing the customer's surplus. We also show that the\noptimal amount of personal information is influenced most by the immediate\nbenefits the customer gets, i.e., the price and the quantity of service offered\nby the service provider, rather than by maximum loss it may incur. Easy\nspenders take larger risks with respect to low-spenders, but an increase in\nprice drives customers towards a more careful risk-taking attitude anyway. A\nmajor role is also played by the privacy level, which the service provider\nemploys to regulate the benefits released to the customers. We also provide a\nclosed form solution for the limit case of a perfectly secure provider, showing\nthat the results do not differ significantly from those obtained in the general\ncase. The trade-off analysis may be employed by the customer to determine its\nlevel of exposure in the relationship with its service provider.",

    "summary": "Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is very\nvital because the security protocols therein, should be devised to work at the\nlink layer. Theoretically, any link layer security protocol must support three\nvital security attributes viz. Confidentiality, Message Integrity and Replay\nprotection. However, in order to ensure lesser overhead, replay protection is\noften not incorporated as part of the link layer security framework. We argue\nhere, that it is essential to implement replay protection at the link layer\nonly and devise a simple scheme to do so. We first survey the common approaches\nto ensuring replay protection in conventional networks. We also implement the\nconventional algorithms for replay protection using the link layer framework\nfor WSNs viz. TinySec as the underlying platform. Subsequently analyzing their\nlimitations, we propose a novel Bloom-filter based replay protection algorithm\nfor unicast communications.

    "summary": "Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) indeed is\ncritical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well\nas due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes\nand degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation\nsensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on\nlow-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop\ncommunication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at\nthe link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of\nbeing at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an\nenergy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists\na number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of\nthe security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we\nshow in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands\nof the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for\ninvestigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer\nsecurity architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with\nrespect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and\nexperiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security\narchitecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related\nto our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes\nof operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection.

    "summary": "The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of resource starved sensor\nnodes that are deployed to sense, process and communicate vital information to\nthe base station.

Such innetwork processing\nlargely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a\ncompact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous\n& pervasive deployment, heavier resource demands of the security protocols and\ndue to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns\nin WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions\nwhen using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes\ndepends on that of various other nodes. Hence, the protocols for data\naggregation have to carefully devised with a constant vigil on ensuring\nsecurity of the data.

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of end-end security enhancement by resorting\nto deliberate noise injected in ciphertexts. The main goal is to generate a\ndegraded wiretap channel in application layer over which Wyner-type secrecy\nencoding is invoked to deliver additional secure information. More\nspecifically, we study secrecy enhancement of DES block cipher working in\ncipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable and intentional noise is introduced\ninto encrypted data in application layer. A verification strategy in exhaustive\nsearch step of linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful\nattack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is\ncreated over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's\ncryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel\nstates at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be\ndelivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over super-frames ahead of\nencryption, namely, our proposed secrecy encoding-then-encryption scheme. These\nsecrecy bits could be taken as symmetric keys for upcoming frames. Numerical\nresults indicate that a sufficiently large secrecy rate can be achieved by\nselective noise addition.",

    "summary": "Many operations in power grids, such as fault detection and event location\nestimation, depend on precise timing information. In this paper, a novel Time\nSynchronization Attack (TSA) is proposed to attack the timing information in\nsmart grid. Since many applications in smart grid utilize synchronous\nmeasurements and most of the measurement devices are equipped with global\npositioning system (GPS) for precise timing, it is highly probable to attack\nthe measurement system by spoofing the GPS. The effectiveness of TSA is\ndemonstrated for three applications of phasor measurement unit (PMU) in smart\ngrid, namely transmission line fault detection, voltage stability monitoring\nand event locationing. The validity of TSA is demonstrated by numerical\nsimulations.",

    "summary": "A novel time synchronization attack (TSA) on wide area monitoring systems in\nsmart grid has been identified in the first part of this paper. A cross layer\ndetection mechanism is proposed to combat TSA in part II of this paper. In the\nphysical layer, we propose a GPS carrier signal noise ratio (C/No) based\nspoofing detection technique. In addition, a patch-monopole hybrid antenna is\napplied to receive GPS signal. By computing the standard deviation of the C/No\ndifference from two GPS receivers, a priori probability of spoofing detection\nis fed to the upper layer, where power system state is estimated and\ncontrolled. A trustworthiness based evaluation method is applied to identify\nthe PMU being under TSA. Both the physical layer and upper layer algorithms are\nintegrated to detect the TSA, thus forming a cross layer mechanism. Experiment\nis carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed TSA detection\nalgorithm.",

    "summary": "The characteristic novelty of what is generally meant by a \"physical\nunclonable function\" (PUF) is precisely defined, in order to supply a firm\nbasis for security evaluations and the proposal of new security mechanisms. A\nPUF is defined as a hardware device which implements a physical function with\nan output value that changes with its argument. A PUF can be clonable, but a\nsecure PUF must be unclonable. This proposed meaning of a PUF is cleanly\ndelineated from the closely related concepts of \"conventional unclonable\nfunction\", \"physically obfuscated key\", \"random-number generator\", \"controlled\nPUF\" and \"strong PUF\". The structure of a systematic security evaluation of a\nPUF enabled by the proposed formal definition is outlined. Practically all\ncurrent and novel physical (but not conventional) unclonable physical functions\nare PUFs by our definition. Thereby the proposed definition captures the\nexisting intuition about what is a PUF and remains flexible enough to encompass\nfurther research. In a second part we quantitatively characterize two classes\nof PUF security mechanisms, the standard one, based on a minimum secret\nread-out time, and a novel one, based on challenge-dependent erasure of stored\ninformation. The new mechanism is shown to allow in principle the construction\nof a \"quantum-PUF\", that is absolutely secure while not requiring the storage\nof an exponentially large secret. The construction of a PUF that is\nmathematically and physically unclonable in principle does not contradict the\nlaws of physics.",

An application that\napplies insufficient server-side input validations is however vulnerable to\nparameter tampering attacks, which manipulate the exchanged parameters.\nExisting fuzzing-based scanning approaches however neglected these important\ncontrols, and this caused their fuzzing requests to be dropped before they can\nreach any vulnerable code.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the workflow and\nparameter dependent constraints, which are then maintained and leveraged for\nautomatic detection of server acceptances during fuzzing. We realized the\napproach by building a generic blackbox parameter tampering scanner.

    "summary": "Searching accounts for one of the most frequently performed computations over\nthe Internet as well as one of the most important applications of outsourced\ncomputing, producing results that critically affect users' decision-making\nbehaviors. As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over\nvast amounts of web contents is essential.\n  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce\nthe concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and\nprototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a\ntrusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web\ncontents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to\nbe correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This\nsignature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,\nsuch as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages\nthat satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a\ncryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any\nuser to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the\nresult computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming\nwith the query are included in the result. An important property of our\nsolution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on\nthe sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number\nor sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.\n  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more\ninvolved bilinear-map accumulators. As we experimentally demonstrate, the\nprototype implementation of our system gives a low communication overhead\nbetween the search engine and the user, and allows for fast verification of the\nreturned results on the user side.",

Several schemes have been\nproposed on how to detect some of these attacks, but they suffer from a range\nof problems, some of them being impractical and others not being effective\nagainst these attacks. This paper reports the design principles and evaluation\nresults of our proposed framework that autonomously detects and accurately\ncharacterizes a wide range of flooding DDoS attacks in ISP network. Attacks are\ndetected by the constant monitoring of propagation of abrupt traffic changes\ninside ISP network. For this, a newly designed flow-volume based approach\n(FVBA) is used to construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the\nnetwork, and identify anomalies whenever traffic goes out of profile.\nConsideration of varying tolerance factors make proposed detection system\nscalable to the varying network conditions and attack loads in real time.\nSix-sigma method is used to identify threshold values accurately for malicious\nflows characterization. FVBA has been extensively evaluated in a controlled\ntest-bed environment. Detection thresholds and efficiency is justified using\nreceiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For validation, KDD 99, a\npublicly available benchmark dataset is used. The results show that our\nproposed system gives a drastic improvement in terms of detection and false\nalarm rate.",

    "publish": "2012-04-29T07:34:55Z", 
    "summary": "Baldi et \\textit{al.} proposed a variant of McEliece's cryptosystem. The main\nidea is to replace its permutation matrix by adding to it a rank 1 matrix. The\nmotivation for this change is twofold: it would allow the use of codes that\nwere shown to be insecure in the original McEliece's cryptosystem, and it would\nreduce the key size while keeping the same security against generic decoding\nattacks. The authors suggest to use generalized Reed-Solomon codes instead of\nGoppa codes. The public code built with this method is not anymore a\ngeneralized Reed-Solomon code. On the other hand, it contains a very large\nsecret generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we present an attack that\nis built upon a distinguisher which is able to identify elements of this secret\ncode. The distinguisher is constructed by considering the code generated by\ncomponent-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so-called \"square\ncode\"). By using square-code dimension considerations, the initial generalized\nReed-Solomon code can be recovered which permits to decode any ciphertext. A\nsimilar technique has already been successful for mounting an attack against a\nhomomorphic encryption scheme suggested by Bogdanoc et \\textit{al.}. This work\ncan be viewed as another illustration of how a distinguisher of Reed-Solomon\ncodes can be used to devise an attack on cryptosystems based on them.",

    "summary": "Although smartcards are widely used, secure smartcard interoperability has\nremained a significant challenge. Usually each manufacturer provides a closed\nenvironment for their smartcard based applications including the microchip,\nassociated firmware and application software. While the security of this\n\"package\" can be tested and certified for example based on the Common Criteria,\nthe secure and convenient interoperability with other smartcards and smartcard\napplications is not guaranteed. Ideally one would have a middleware that can\nsupport various smartcards and smartcard applications. In our ongoing research\nwe study this scenario with the goal to develop a way to certify secure\nsmartcard interoperability in such an environment. Here we discuss and\nexperimentally demonstrate one critical security problem: if several smartcards\nare connected via a middleware it is possible that a smartcard of type S\nreceives commands that were supposed to be executed on a different smartcard of\ntype S'. Such \"external commands\" can interleave with the commands that were\nsupposed to be executed on S. Here we demonstrate this problem experimentally\nwith a Common Criteria certified digital signature process on two commercially\navailable smartcards. Importantly, in some of these cases the digital signature\nprocesses terminate without generating an error message or warning to the user.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we suggest a multi-dimensional approach towards intrusion\ndetection. Network and system usage parameters like source and destination IP\naddresses; source and destination ports; incoming and outgoing network traffic\ndata rate and number of CPU cycles per request are divided into multiple\ndimensions. Rather than analyzing raw bytes of data corresponding to the values\nof the network parameters, a mature function is inferred during the training\nphase for each dimension. This mature function takes a dimension value as an\ninput and returns a value that represents the level of abnormality in the\nsystem usage with respect to that dimension. This mature function is referred\nto as Individual Anomaly Indicator. Individual Anomaly Indicators recorded for\neach of the dimensions are then used to generate a Global Anomaly Indicator, a\nfunction with n variables (n is the number of dimensions) that provides the\nGlobal Anomaly Factor, an indicator of anomaly in the system usage based on all\nthe dimensions considered together. The Global Anomaly Indicator inferred\nduring the training phase is then used to detect anomaly in the network traffic\nduring the detection phase. Network traffic data encountered during the\ndetection phase is fed back to the system to improve the maturity of the\nIndividual Anomaly Indicators and hence the Global Anomaly Indicator.",

    "summary": "Secure communication between two nodes in a network depends on reliable key\nmanagement systems that generate and distribute keys between communicating\nnodes and a secure routing protocol that establishes a route between them. But\ndue to lack of central server and infrastructure in Mobile Ad hoc Networks\n(MANETs), this is major problem to manage the keys in the network. Dynamically\nchanges in network's topology causes weak trust relationship among the nodes in\nthe network. In MANETs a mobile node operates as not only end terminal but also\nas an intermediate router. Therefore, a multi-hop scenario occurs for\ncommunication in MANETs; where there may be one or more malicious nodes in\nbetween source and destination. A routing protocol is said to be secure that\ndetects the detrimental effects of malicious node(s in the path from source to\ndestination). In this paper, we proposed a key management scheme and a secure\nrouting protocol that secures on demand routing protocol such as DSR and AODV.\nWe assume that MANETs is divided into groups having a group leader in each\ngroup. Group leader has responsibility of key management in its group. Proposed\nkey management scheme is a decentralized scheme that does not require any\nTrusted Third Party (TTP) for key management. In proposed key management\nsystem, both a new node and group leader authenticates each other mutually\nbefore joining the network.

In this paper\nthe primary focus will be on storing messages in encrypted format with a\npassword and send it to the required destination hiding in a QR Code, without\nbeing tracked or decrypted properly by any hacker or spyware.

    "summary": "In this report, we present our approach for protocol analysis together with a\nreal example where we find an important flow in a contemporary wireless sensor\nnetwork security protocol. We start by modelling protocols using a specific\nprocess algebraic formalism called LySa process calculus. We then apply an\nanalysis based on a special program analysis technique called control flow\nanalysis. We apply this technique to the ZigBee-2007 End-to-End Application Key\nEstablishment Protocol and with the help of the analysis discover an unknown\nflaw. Finally we suggest a fix for the protocol, and verify that the fix works\nby using the same technique.",

    "publish": "2012-05-30T18:39:13Z", 
    "summary": "In a gray scale image the pixel value ranges from 0 to 255. But when we use\npixel-value differencing (pvd) method as image steganographic scheme, the pixel\nvalues in the stego-image may exceed gray scale range. An adaptive\nsteganography based on modified pixel-value differencing through management of\npixel values within the range of gray scale has been proposed in this paper.\nPVD method is used and check whether the pixel value exceeds the range on\nembedding. Positions where the pixel exceeds boundary has been marked and a\ndelicate handle is used to keep the value within the range. From the\nexperimental it is seen that the results obtained in proposed method provides\nwith identical payload and visual fidelity of stego-image compared to the pvd\nmethod.",

    "title": "Secure FSM- based arithmetic codes", 
    "publish": "2012-06-05T09:08:47Z", 
    "summary": "Recently, arithmetic coding has attracted the attention of many scholars\nbecause of its high compression capability. Accordingly, in this paper a method\nwhich adds secrecy to this well-known source code is proposed. Finite state\narithmetic code (FSAC) is used as source code to add security. Its finite state\nmachine (FSM) characteristic is exploited to insert some random jumps during\nsource coding process. In addition, a Huffman code is designed for each state\nto make decoding possible even in jumps. Being Prefix free, Huffman codes are\nuseful in tracking correct states for an authorized user when s/he decodes with\ncorrect symmetric pseudo random key. The robustness of our proposed scheme is\nfurther reinforced by adding another extra uncertainty by swapping outputs of\nHuffman codes in each state. Several test images are used for inspecting the\nvalidity of the proposed Huffman Finite State Arithmetic Coding (HFSAC). The\nresults of several experimental, key space analyses, statistical analysis, key\nsensitivity and plaintext sensitivity tests show that HFSAC with a little\neffect on compression efficiency for image cryptosystem provides an efficient\nand secure way for real-time image encryption and transmission.",

    "title": "Refining a Quantitative Information Flow Metric", 
    "publish": "2012-06-05T11:39:55Z", 
    "summary": "We introduce a new perspective into the field of quantitative information\nflow (QIF) analysis that invites the community to bound the leakage, reported\nby QIF quantifiers, by a range consistent with the size of a program's secret\ninput instead of by a mathematically sound (but counter-intuitive) upper bound\nof that leakage. To substantiate our position, we present a refinement of a\nrecent QIF metric that appears in the literature. Our refinement is based on\nslight changes we bring into the design of that metric. These changes do not\naffect the theoretical premises onto which the original metric is laid.\nHowever, they enable the natural association between flow results and the\nexhaustive search effort needed to uncover a program's secret information (or\nthe residual secret part of that information) to be clearly established. The\nrefinement we discuss in this paper validates our perspective and demonstrates\nits importance in the future design of QIF quantifiers.",

    "publish": "2012-06-05T16:17:14Z", 
    "summary": "In todays world of technology and gadgets almost every person is having a\nportable device, be it a laptop or the smart phones. The user would like to\nhave all the services at his fingertips and access them through the portable\ndevice he owns. Maybe he wants some data from the fellow user or from the\nservice provider or maybe he wants to control his smart devices at home from\nwherever he is. In the present era of mobile environments, interactions between\nthe user device and the service provider must be secure enough regardless of\nthe type of device used to access or utilize the services. In this paper we\npropose a \"Secure Three Way Authentication (STWA)\" technique intended to\npreserve the user privacy and to accomplish ownership authentication in order\nto securely deliver the services to the user devices. This technique will also\nhelp the users or the service providers to check if the device is compromised\nor not with the help of the encrypted pass-phrases that are being exchanged.",
