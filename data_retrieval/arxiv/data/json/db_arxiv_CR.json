    "summary": "We investigate, in the Shannon model, the security of constructions\ncorresponding to double and (two-key) triple DES. That is, we consider\nF_{k1}(F_{k2}(.)) and F_{k1}(F_{k2}^{-1}(F_{k1}(.))) with the component\nfunctions being ideal ciphers. This models the resistance of these\nconstructions to ``generic'' attacks like meet in the middle attacks. We obtain\nthe first proof that composition actually increases the security of these\nconstructions in some meaningful sense. We compute a bound on the probability\nof breaking the double cipher as a function of the number of computations of\nthe base cipher made, and the number of examples of the composed cipher seen,\nand show that the success probability is the square of that for a single key\ncipher. The same bound holds for the two-key triple cipher. The first bound is\ntight and shows that meet in the middle is the best possible generic attack\nagainst the double cipher."

    "summary": "A security policy states the acceptable actions of an information system, as\nthe actions bear on security. There is a pressing need for organizations to\ndeclare their security policies, even informal statements would be better than\nthe current practice. But, formal policy statements are preferable to support\n(1) reasoning about policies, e.g., for consistency and completeness, (2)\nautomated enforcement of the policy, e.g., using wrappers around legacy systems\nor after the fact with an intrusion detection system, and (3) other formal\nmanipulation of policies, e.g., the composition of policies. We present LaSCO,\nthe Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of\ntwo parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what\nis allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO\nhave the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies\nare specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual\nview of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we\nprovide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be\nvery perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have\nfound to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of\npolicies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to\ndescribe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an\nobject-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating\nsystem objects. A LaSCO specification can be automatically translated into\nexecutable code that checks an invocation of a program with respect to a\npolicy. The implementation of LaSCO is in Java, and generates wrappers to check\nJava programs with respect to a policy."

    "summary": "In this dissertation, we present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints\non Objects, a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs\nand present a method for enforcing policies so expressed. Other approaches for\nstating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to\neither policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may\nbe expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable\nproperties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many\ndifferent systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail,\nuser friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal\nreasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs\nannotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy\napplies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse\napplications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems,\ndistributed systems, and networks.\n  Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for\nimplementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of\nthe system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO\nfor Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to\nfacilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a\nnetwork as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large\nnetworks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that\nenable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of\nprecisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and\nimplementing it on a system."

It is known that zero-knowledge is not necessarily preserved in such\nan environment. Designing concurrent zero-knowledge proofs is a fundamental\nissue in the study of zero-knowledge since known zero-knowledge protocols\ncannot be run in a realistic modern computing environment. In this paper we\npresent a concurrent zero-knowledge proof systems for all languages in NP.\nCurrently, the proof system we present is the only known proof system that\nretains the zero-knowledge property when copies of the proof are allowed to run\nin an asynchronous environment. Our proof system has $\\tilde{O}(\\log^2 k)$\nrounds (for a security parameter $k$), which is almost optimal, as it is shown\nby Canetti Kilian Petrank and Rosen that black-box concurrent zero-knowledge\nrequires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)$ rounds.\n  Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali introduced the notion of {\\em\nresettable} zero-knowledge, and modified an earlier version of our proof system\nto obtain the first resettable zero-knowledge proof system. This protocol\nrequires $k^{\\theta(1)}$ rounds.

In such a scheme, one makes\nuse of the property that in the given group the word problem has a polynomial\ntime solution, while the conjugacy problem has no known polynomial solution. An\nexample is the braid group from topology in which the word problem is solvable\nin polynomial time while the only known solutions to the conjugacy problem are\nexponential. The attack in this paper is based on having a canonical\nrepresentative of each string relative to which a length function may be\ncomputed. Hence the term length attack. Such canonical representatives are\nknown to exist for the braid group."

We explore the\nexact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key\ndifference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces\nand explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from\nstrand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in\nthe strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest\ncan be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in\nthe strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To\nhighlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand\nspaces can be extended to model more systems."

This provides the first alternative\nto Ajtai and Dwork's original 1996 cryptosystem. Our second result is a family\nof collision resistant hash functions which, apart from improving the security\nin terms of the unique shortest vector problem, is also the first example of an\nanalysis which is not based on Ajtai's iterative step.

These are often computers which do not have a\ntask in the network, but are otherwise indestinguishable from regular\ncomputers. Such bait systems could be interconnected (honeynets). These\nhoneynets are equipped with special software, facilitating forensic anylisis of\nincidents. Taking average of the wide variety of recorded data it is possible\nto learn considerable more about the behaviour of attackers in networks than\nwith traditional methods. This article is an introduction into electronic bait\nand a description of the setup and first experiences of such a network deployed\nat RWTH Aachen University.\n  -----\n  Als elektronische Koeder (honeypots) bezeichnet man Netzwerkressourcen, deren\nWert darin besteht, angegriffen und kompromittiert zu werden.

Organizations are reluctant to share logs because of the risk of\nexposing sensitive information to potential attackers. We believe this\nreluctance remains high because current anonymization techniques are weak and\none-size-fits-all--or better put, one size tries to fit all. We must develop\nstandards and make anonymization available at varying levels, striking a\nbalance between privacy and utility. Organizations have different needs and\ntrust other organizations to different degrees. They must be able to map\nmultiple anonymization levels with defined risks to the trust levels they share\nwith (would-be) receivers. It is not until there are industry standards for\nmultiple levels of anonymization that we will be able to move forward and\nachieve the goal of widespread sharing of logs for security researchers."

Indeed, they enjoy some nice chaotic properties, which seem to be\nsuitable for use in Cryptography. Moreover, they satisfy a semi-group property,\nwhich makes possible implementing a trapdoor mechanism. In this paper we study\na public key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both\nencryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is\nquite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not\nsecure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding\nplaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce\nforgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out\nthat also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an\nauthentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are\nnot secure due to the aforementioned attack. We close the paper by discussing\nthe issues and the possibilities of constructing public key cryptosystems on\nreal numbers."

We propose a\nsecurity abstraction, inspired by earlier work on secure RPC, in which the\nmethods exported by a web service are annotated with one of three security\nlevels: none, authenticated, or both authenticated and encrypted. We model our\nabstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web\nservices. We describe the semantics of our object calculus by translating to a\nlower-level language with primitives for message passing and cryptography. To\nvalidate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the\ncorrect authentication of requests and responses. By appeal to the type theory\nfor cryptographic protocols of Gordon and Jeffrey's Cryptyc, we verify the\ncorrespondence assertions simply by typing.

In this thesis, we\nwould like to discuss the security aspects during the design process of the\nproposed directed digital signature schemes. The security of the most digital\nsignature schemes widely use in practice is based on the two difficult\nproblems, viz; the problem of factoring integers (The RSA scheme) and the\nproblem of finding discrete logarithms over finite fields (The ElGamal scheme).\nThe proposed works in this thesis is divided into seven chapters."

    "summary": "Over the recent months it has become clear that the current generation of\ncryptographic hashing algorithms are insufficient to meet future needs. The ASH\nfamily of algorithms provides modifications to the existing SHA-2 family. These\nmodifications are designed with two main goals: 1) Providing increased\ncollision resistance. 2) Increasing mitigation of security risks\npost-collision. The unique public/private sections and salt/pepper design\nelements provide increased flexibility for a broad range of applications. The\nASH family is a new generation of cryptographic hashing algorithms."

    "summary": "During the last years, large-scale simulations of realistic physical\nenvironments which support the interaction of multiple participants over the\nInternet have become increasingly available and economically significant, most\nnotably in the computer gaming industry. Such systems, commonly called\nnetworked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server\narchitecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the\nsimulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural\nchoice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic\nintegrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the\nphysical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality\nof events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of\nsemantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive\npolicies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and\nare therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity\nprotocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to\naudit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates\nlow network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally\ndecouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the\nsimulation."

    "summary": "Internet worms have become a widespread threat to system and network\noperations. In order to fight them more efficiently, it is necessary to analyze\nnewly discovered worms and attack patterns. This paper shows how techniques\nbased on Kolmogorov Complexity can help in the analysis of internet worms and\nnetwork traffic. Using compression, different species of worms can be clustered\nby type. This allows us to determine whether an unknown worm binary could in\nfact be a later version of an existing worm in an extremely simple, automated,\nmanner. This may become a useful tool in the initial analysis of malicious\nbinaries. Furthermore, compression can also be useful to distinguish different\ntypes of network traffic and can thus help to detect traffic anomalies: Certain\nanomalies may be detected by looking at the compressibility of a network\nsession alone. We furthermore show how to use compression to detect malicious\nnetwork sessions that are very similar to known intrusion attempts. This\ntechnique could become a useful tool to detect new variations of an attack and\nthus help to prevent IDS evasion. We provide two new plugins for Snort which\ndemonstrate both approaches."

So far there have been many reliable detecting methods on\nvarious steganographic algorithms, while there are few approaches that can\nextract the hidden information. In this paper, the difficulty of extracting\nhidden information, which is essentially a kind of privacy, is analyzed with\ninformation-theoretic method in the terms of unicity distance of steganographic\nkey (abbreviated stego key). A lower bound for the unicity distance is\nobtained, which shows the relations between key rate, message rate, hiding\ncapacity and difficulty of extraction. Furthermore the extracting attack to\nsteganography is viewed as a special kind of cryptanalysis, and an effective\nmethod on recovering the stego key of popular LSB replacing steganography in\nspatial images is presented by combining the detecting technique of\nsteganalysis and correlation attack of cryptanalysis together. The analysis for\nthis method and experimental results on steganographic software ``Hide and Seek\n4.1\" are both accordant with the information-theoretic conclusion."

The first one is mostly devoted to\ndifferent methods of securing the code and protecting its integrity; starting\nfrom watermarking and fingerprinting, up to methods designed specially for\nmobile agent systems: encrypted function, cryptographic traces, time limited\nblack-box security, chained-MAC protocol, publicly-verifiable chained digital\nsignatures The second part presents new concept for providing mobile agents\nwith integrity protection, based on a zero-knowledge proof system."

However, the previous\nprotocols were easily vulnerable to several attacks such as denial of service,\npassword guessing, stolen-verifier and impersonation atacks etc. Recently,\nChang et al. proposed a simple authenticated key agreement and protected\npassword change protocol for enhancing the security and efficiency. In this\npaper, authors shall show that password guessing, denial of service and\nknown-key attacks can work in their password change protocol. At the same time,\nauthors shall propose a new password change protocol to withstand all the\nthreats of security."

This paper presents an approach securing a system without any\nknowledge of the system source code. The security module adds to the existing\nsystem authentication and authorisation based on aspect oriented programming\nand the liberty alliance framework, an upcoming industrie standard providing\nsingle sign on. In an initial training phase the module is adapted to the\napplication which is to be secured. Moreover the use of hardware tokens and\nproactive computing is demonstrated.

Since then, it has been\nbelieved that the perfectly random and uncompressible OTP which is transmitted\nneeds to have a length equal to the message length for this result to be true.\nIn this paper, we prove that the length of the transmitted OTP which actually\ncontains useful information need not be compromised and could be less than the\nmessage length without sacrificing perfect secrecy. We also provide a new\ninterpretation for the OTP encryption by treating the message bits as making\nTrue/False statements about the pad, which we define as a private-object. We\nintroduce the paradigm of private-object cryptography where messages are\ntransmitted by verifying statements about a secret-object. We conclude by\nsuggesting the use of Formal Axiomatic Systems for investing N bits of secret."

In other words, a vulnerability exists in the software application\nif it allows violation of these constraints and assumptions. The taxonomy\nclassifies these constraints and assumptions. The model also serves as a basis\nfor the classification scheme the taxonomy uses, in which the computer system\nresources such as, memory, input/output, and cryptographic resources serve as\ncategories and subcategories. Vulnerabilities, which are expressed in the form\nof constraints and assumptions, are classified according to these categories\nand subcategories. This taxonomy is both novel and distinctively different from\nother taxonomies found in the literature."

    "summary": "In the UNIX/Linux environment the kernel can log every command process\ncreated by every user using process accounting. This data has many potential\nuses, including the investigation of security incidents. However, process\naccounting data is also sensitive since it contains private user information.\nConsequently, security system administrators have been hindered from sharing\nthese logs. Given that many interesting security applications could use process\naccounting data, it would be useful to have a tool that could protect private\nuser information in the logs. For this reason we introduce SCRUB-PA, a tool\nthat uses multi-level multi-dimensional anonymization on process accounting log\nfiles in order to provide different levels of privacy protection. It is our\ngoal that SCRUB-PA will promote the sharing of process accounting logs while\npreserving privacy."

    "summary": "The paper develops a novel approach to stream cipher design: Both the state\nupdate function and the output function of the corresponding pseudorandom\ngenerators are compositions of arithmetic and bitwise logical operations, which\nare standard instructions of modern microprocessors. Moreover, both the state\nupdate function and the output function are being modified dynamically during\nthe encryption. Also, these compositions could be keyed, so the only\ninformation available to an attacker is that these functions belong to some\nexponentially large class.\n  The paper shows that under rather loose conditions the output sequence is\nuniformly distributed, achieves maximum period length and has high linear\ncomplexity and high $\\ell$-error linear complexity. Ciphers of this kind are\nflexible: One could choose a suitable combination of instructions to obtain due\nperformance without affecting the quality of the output sequence. Finally, some\nevidence is given that a key recovery problem for (reasonably designed) stream\nciphers of this kind is intractable up to plausible conjectures."

    "summary": "Basic role based access control [RBAC] provides a mechanism for segregating\naccess privileges based upon a user's hierarchical roles within an\norganization. This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of\nmultiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement\nfor different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our\ncase, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be\neffectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's\norganizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy\nto be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations\nare served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their\naccess as needed.\n  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for\naccurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies\nfor providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the\namount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.\nThe resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and\nvisualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will\ngive some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and\nprivileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges\ncan be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by\njoint tenancy."

    "summary": "In this paper we introduce a new chaotic stream cipher Mmohocc which utilizes\nthe fundamental chaos characteristics. The designs of the major components of\nthe cipher are given. Its cryptographic properties of period, auto- and\ncross-correlations, and the mixture of Markov processes and spatiotemporal\neffects are investigated. The cipher is resistant to the related-key-IV\nattacks, Time/Memory/Data tradeoff attacks, algebraic attacks, and chosen-text\nattacks. The keystreams successfully passed two batteries of statistical tests\nand the encryption speed is comparable with RC4."

    "summary": "Although good encryption functions are probabilistic, most symbolic models do\nnot capture this aspect explicitly. A typical solution, recently used to prove\nthe soundness of such models with respect to computational ones, is to\nexplicitly represent the dependency of ciphertexts on random coins as labels.\nIn order to make these label-based models useful, it seems natural to try to\nextend the underlying decision procedures and the implementation of existing\ntools. In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the\nfollowing soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security\nproperties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and\nauthenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies\nsecurity in the label-based model. Combined with the soundness result of\n(\\textbf{?}) our theorem enables the translation of security results in\nunlabeled symbolic models to computational security."

Moreover, the proposed steganographic\nsystem has two important properties. First, the rate of transmission of hidden\ninformation approaches the Shannon entropy of the covertext source as the size\nof blocks used for hidden text encoding tends to infinity. Second, if the size\nof the alphabet of the covertext source and its minentropy tend to infinity\nthen the number of bits of hidden text per letter of covertext tends to\n$\\log(n!)/n$ where $n$ is the (fixed) size of blocks used for hidden text\nencoding.

It turns out that all the\ncollusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is\nreduced by a factor of more than 2.\n  Second, we study the statistical properties of the fingerprinting scheme, in\nparticular the average and variance of the accusations. We identify which\ncolluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a\ngaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the\naccusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error\nrate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for\nrigid proofs.\n  Combining the results of these two approaches, we show that the Tardos scheme\ncan be used with a code length approximately 5 times shorter than in the\noriginal construction."

    "summary": "With the rapid spread of various mobile terminals in our society, the\nimportance of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in\nadversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure\npositioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric\nproperty of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics\nthat a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In\nparticular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio\nsignal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the\nchallenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct\nthe above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of\nbidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a\nmobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant\nprotected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and\nthe time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.\nOur proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile\nterminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to\nthe trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is\nfree from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations\nin the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the\nopen air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze\nthe security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in\ncomparison to previous proposals."

In an effort to reduce the setup assumptions\nrequired for efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure\nagainst concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks, we consider a model, which we\ncall the Authenticated Public-Key (APK) model. The APK model seems to\nsignificantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted\nparty or honest execution of a centralized algorithm are required), and can be\nseen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from\n\\cite{CGGM,MR}, and a weaker variation of the registered public-key model used\nin \\cite{BCNP}.

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a unification algorithm for the theory $E$ which\ncombines unification algorithms for $E\\_{\\std}$ and $E\\_{\\ACUN}$ (ACUN\nproperties, like XOR) but compared to the more general combination methods uses\nspecific properties of the equational theories for further optimizations. Our\noptimizations drastically reduce the number of non-deterministic choices, in\nparticular those for variable identification and linear orderings. This is\nimportant for reducing both the runtime of the unification algorithm and the\nnumber of unifiers in the complete set of unifiers. We emphasize that obtaining\na ``small'' set of unifiers is essential for the efficiency of the constraint\nsolving procedure within which the unification algorithm is used. The method is\nimplemented in the CL-Atse tool for security protocol analysis."

    "summary": "Differential Power Analysis (DPA) presents a major challenge to\nmathematically-secure cryptographic protocols. Attackers can break the\nencryption by measuring the energy consumed in the working digital circuit. To\nprevent this type of attack, this paper proposes the use of reversible logic\nfor designing the ALU of a cryptosystem. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate\nzero energy. Thus, it would be of great significance to apply reversible logic\nto designing secure cryptosystems. As far as is known, this is the first\nattempt to apply reversible logic to developing secure cryptosystems. In a\nprototype of a reversible ALU for a crypto-processor, reversible designs of\nadders and Montgomery multipliers are presented. The reversible designs of a\ncarry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are\npresented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the\nTSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to\ndesign the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential\ncircuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to\ndesign a reversible modulo multiplier. It is intended that this paper will\nprovide a starting point for developing cryptosystems secure against DPA\nattacks."

One way to address these issues is\nthe use of symmetric key cryptography, relying on a secret key shared by all\nmembers of the network.

The framework is intended to facilitate automatic as well\nas manual verification of large structured security protocols. Our approach is\nto verify properties of component protocols in a multi-protocol environment,\nthen deduce properties about the composed protocol. To reduce the complexity of\nmulti-protocol verification, we introduce a notion of protocol independence and\nprove a number of theorems that enable analysis of independent component\nprotocols in isolation.\n  To illustrate the applicability of our framework to real-world protocols, we\nstudy a key establishment sequence in WiMax consisting of three subprotocols.\nExcept for a small amount of trivial reasoning, the analysis is done using\nautomatic tools."

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a new identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme using\nbilinear pairings. Our IBE scheme enjoys the same \\textsf{Key Extraction} and\n\\textsf{Decryption} algorithms with the famous IBE scheme of Boneh and Franklin\n(BF-IBE for short), while differs from the latter in that it has modified\n\\textsf{Setup} and \\textsf{Encryption} algorithms.\n  Compared with BF-IBE, we show that ours are more practical in a multiple\nprivate key generator (PKG) environment, mainly due to that the session secret\n$g_{ID}$ could be pre-computed \\emph{before} any interaction, and the sender\ncould encrypt a message using $g_{ID}$ prior to negotiating with the intended\nrecipient(s). As an application of our IBE scheme, we also derive an escrowed\nElGamal scheme which possesses certain good properties in practice."

We give a sufficient condition ensuring\nsecrecy for protocols where rules have encryption depth at most two, that is\nsatisfied by almost all practical protocols. The only allowed primitives in the\nclass of protocols we consider are pairing and encryption with atomic keys.\nMoreover, we describe an algorithm of practical interest which transforms a\ncryptographic protocol into a secure one from the point of view of secrecy,\nwithout changing its original goal with respect to secrecy of nonces and keys,\nprovided the protocol satisfies some conditions. These conditions are not very\nrestrictive and are satisfied for most practical protocols."

Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a\nlogic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4\nto be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of\nqu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +\nf(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4\nand alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,\nmanifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is\nfalsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax\n* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To\nthe signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1\nand Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.\nTherefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which\nconnotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in\nREESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly\nselected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure."

    "summary": "A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to\na remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary.\nRecently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA\nConference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently\nprocess an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not\neffective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper\nextends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we\nanalyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the\nworkload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on\ntextual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of\nautomated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real\nhuman users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and\ngive some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the\nresults. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the\nrelationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human\nidentification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably\n``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model."

However, the\ncommunication complexity of the resulting protocols depend on the size of the\ncircuit that expresses the functionality to be computed and hence can be\nimpractical. Hence special solutions are needed for specific problems for\nefficiency reasons. The point inclusion problem in computational geometry is a\nspecial multiparty computation and has got many applications. Previous\nprotocols for the secure point inclusion problem are not adequate.

We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular\nof anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for\ninstance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the\nparties should be considered invisible to the adversary.\n  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which\nbetter model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their\ndecision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the\nadversary.\n  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible\nschedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are\nindependent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical\ncases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is\npossible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary\n`noticing'."

We give algorithms for the problem (we call the\nMSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give\nvarious attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed.\nOne of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and\ntime complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case\nusing a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe\nO(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),\nwhere the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,\nXSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit.

    "summary": "Side channel attacks are a major security concern for smart cards and other\nembedded devices. They analyze the variations on the power consumption to find\nthe secret key of the encryption algorithm implemented within the security IC.\nTo address this issue, logic gates that have a constant power dissipation\nindependent of the input signals, are used in security ICs. This paper presents\na design methodology to create fully connected differential pull down networks.\nFully connected differential pull down networks are transistor networks that\nfor any complementary input combination connect all the internal nodes of the\nnetwork to one of the external nodes of the network. They are memoryless and\nfor that reason have a constant load capacitance and power consumption. This\ntype of networks is used in specialized logic gates to guarantee a constant\ncontribution of the internal nodes into the total power consumption of the\nlogic gate."

    "summary": "The hybrid hiding encryption algorithm, as its name implies, embraces\nconcepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an\nimproved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation\nof this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations\nof a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no\nexploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that\nthe input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between\nthe throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be\nviewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented\nmicro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed\nusing five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message\nalignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption\nmodule. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation\nresults. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and\nrouting reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison\nwith other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed."

Most of those\nembedded systems (pay-TV, PDAs, mobile phones, etc...) make use of external\nmemory. As a result, the main problem is that data and instructions are\nconstantly exchanged between memory (RAM) and CPU in clear form on the bus.\nThis memory may contain confidential data like commercial software or private\ncontents, which either the end-user or the content provider is willing to\nprotect. The goal of this paper is to clearly describe the problem of\nprocessor-memory bus communications in this regard and the existing techniques\napplied to secure the communication channel through encryption - Performance\noverheads implied by those solutions will be extensively discussed in this\npaper."

    "summary": "Securing communication channels is especially needed in wireless\nenvironments. But applying cipher mechanisms in software is limited by the\ncalculation and energy resources of the mobile devices. If hardware is applied\nto realize cryptographic operations cost becomes an issue. In this paper we\ndescribe an approach which tackles all these three points. We implemented a\nhardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication in extended Galois fields\n(GF) applying Karatsuba's method iteratively. With this approach the area\nconsumption is reduced to 2.1 mm^2 in comparison to. 6.2 mm^2 for the standard\napplication of Karatsuba's method i.e. for recursive application. Our approach\nalso reduces the energy consumption to 60 per cent of the original approach.\nThe price we have to pay for these achievement is the increased execution time.\nIn our implementation a polynomial multiplication takes 3 clock cycles whereas\nthe recurisve Karatsuba approach needs only one clock cycle. But considering\narea, energy and calculation speed we are convinced that the benefits of our\napproach outweigh its drawback."

As a corollary, we introduce a lower bound, based on an induced\nmatching of hypergraph of qualified sets, for the best pixel expansion of the\naforementioned model and the traditional model of visual cryptography realized\nby basis matrices.

The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these\ntwo sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and\nnothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain\napplications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that\nreports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a\nprivate matching protocol is called \\emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance,\nwhen elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.\n  We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment.\nElements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show\nthat the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect.\nSubsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first,\nsimple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \\binom{T}{t} (T\n\\log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message\ncomplexity of $O(n T (\\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor\ntime complexity. Additionally, we present protocols based on the computation of\nthe Hamming distance and on oblivious transfer, that have different, sometimes\nmore efficient, performance characteristics."

Combining\nthese two properties we can produce unilateral one-way function and provide a\ncase of utilizing this function to construct encryption algorithm. The\nmultiple-precision (MP) library is used to analyze nonlinear dynamics systems\nand achieve the code.

However, there is an inherent trade off between\nthe amount of information revealed in the log and the usefulness of the log to\nthe client (the utility of a log). There are many anonymization techniques, and\nthere are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to\nanonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with\nvarying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of\ndifferent anonymization policies on logs. We provide an empirical analysis of\nthe effect of varying anonymization policies by looking at the number of alerts\ngenerated by an Intrusion Detection System.

With this\ntechnique, the signer receives a partial private key from a trusted authority\nand unblinds it to get his private key, in turn, overcomes the key escrow\nproblem which is a constraint in most of the pairing-based proxy signature\nschemes. The scheme fulfills the necessary security requirements of proxy\nsignature and resists other possible threats."

    "summary": "The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by\nSteinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be\nused as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional\nfunctionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature\nto any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message\nwas indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We\npropose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our\nfirst scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be\nanalyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery\nassuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the\nknowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the\nBoneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle\nmodel, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman\nproblem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained\ncomputation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are\npairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user\nsetting proposed by Desmedt in 2003."

At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger\nrevisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and\nefficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open\nthe problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is\nable to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated\nseveral times.\n  This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago,\nand shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We\ndescribe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the\nAteniese-Hohenberger model.

    "summary": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of\nthe future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability."

    "summary": "We study the relationship between obfuscation and white-box cryptography. We\ncapture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \\emph{White-Box\nProperty (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the\nWBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a\n\\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an\nobfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak\nsome ``useless'' non-black-box information.\n  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an\nobfuscation (under \\emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every\nspecification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a\n\\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply\nthat under \\emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We\nthen show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist\n(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.\n  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a\nnon-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain\nspecification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but\napproximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.\n  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between\n``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information."

Our public key algorithm is a\nbijective mapping, it does not perform message expansions and can be used both\nfor encryption and signatures. The public key consist of n quadratic\npolynomials with n variables where n=140, 160, ... . A particular\ncharacteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly\nparallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric\nblock cipher - the reason for the phrase \"A Public Key Block Cipher\" in the\ntitle of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the\nalgorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo\n-- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores\nand OpenMP 2.0 library. However, implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA that is\nrunning on 249.4 MHz it achieves decryption throughput of 399 Mbps, and\nimplemented on four Xilinx Virtex-5 chips that are running on 276.7 MHz it\nachieves encryption throughput of 44.27 Gbps.

However, dealing with the\nalgebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) has been\nproblematic. In particular, ProVerif cannot deal with XOR. In this paper, we\nshow how to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories with XOR to the\nXOR-free case. Our reduction works for an expressive class of Horn theories. A\nlarge class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator\ncan be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol\nanalysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very\nefficient in the XOR-free case.

    "summary": "Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This\nmakes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations,\ninto an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric\nstudies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse\nselection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were\nfound among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those\nwithout. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust\nauthorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics\nsuggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if\ntrust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of\ntrust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to\npower-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust.\nThe evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are\nknown to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive\nattacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust\nbuilding, and suggest some ideas for exploration."

Many different carrier file\nformats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their\nfrequency on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there\nexists a large variety of steganographic techniques some are more complex than\nothers and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different\napplications have different requirements of the steganography technique used.\nFor example, some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret\ninformation, while others require a larger secret message to be hidden. This\npaper intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and\ntechniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good\nsteganographic algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic\ntechniques are more suitable for which applications."

In the PPDM, we seek to\noutsource our data for data mining tasks to a third party while maintaining its\nprivacy. In this paper, we revise one of the recent PPDM schemes (i.e., FS)\nwhich is designed for privacy preserving association rule mining (PP-ARM). Our\nanalysis shows some limitations of the FS scheme in term of its storage\nrequirements guaranteeing a reasonable privacy standard and the high\ncomputation as well. On the other hand, we introduce a robust definition of\nprivacy that considers the average case privacy and motivates the study of a\nweakness in the structure of FS (i.e., fake transactions filtering). In order\nto overcome this limit, we introduce a hybrid scheme that considers both\nprivacy and resources guidelines. Experimental results show the efficiency of\nour proposed scheme over the previously introduced one and opens directions for\nfurther development."

    "summary": "Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the\npractice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality\nillegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of\nobscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and\nusability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool\nJDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using\nvarious array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array\nfolding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system\nobfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code\nthat is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number\nof experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our\ntool."

    "summary": "This paper offers several contributions for separation of duty (SoD)\nadministration in role-based access control (RBAC) systems. We first introduce\na new formal framework, based on business perspective, where SoD constraints\nare analyzed introducing the activity concept. This notion helps organizations\ndefine SoD constraints in terms of business requirements and reduces management\ncomplexity in large-scale RBAC systems. The model enables the definition of a\nwide taxonomy of conflict types. In particular, object-based SoD is introduced\nusing the SoD domain concept, namely the set of data in which transaction\nconflicts may occur. Together with the formalization of the above properties,\nin this paper we also show the effectiveness of our proposal: we have applied\nthe model to a large, existing organization; results highlight the benefits of\nadopting the proposed model in terms of reduced administration cost."

    "summary": "Wiener's attack is a well-known polynomial-time attack on a RSA cryptosystem\nwith small secret decryption exponent d, which works if d<n^{0.25}, where n=pq\nis the modulus of the cryptosystem. Namely, in that case, d is the denominator\nof some convergent p_m/q_m of the continued fraction expansion of e/n, and\ntherefore d can be computed efficiently from the public key (n,e).\n  There are several extensions of Wiener's attack that allow the RSA\ncryptosystem to be broken when d is a few bits longer than n^{0.25}. They all\nhave the run-time complexity (at least) O(D^2), where d=Dn^{0.25}. Here we\npropose a new variant of Wiener's attack, which uses results on Diophantine\napproximations of the form |\\alpha - p/q| < c/q^2, and \"meet-in-the-middle\"\nvariant for testing the candidates (of the form rq_{m+1} + sq_m) for the secret\nexponent. This decreases the run-time complexity of the attack to O(D log(D))\n(with the space complexity O(D))."

    "summary": "Chaotic cryptography is based on the properties of chaos as source of\nentropy. Many different schemes have been proposed to take advantage of those\nproperties and to design new strategies to encrypt information. However, the\nright and efficient use of chaos in the context of cryptography requires a\nthorough knowledge about the dynamics of the selected chaotic system. Indeed,\nif the final encryption system reveals enough information about the underlying\nchaotic system it could be possible for a cryptanalyst to get the key, part of\nthe key or some information somehow equivalent to the key just analyzing those\ndynamical properties leaked by the cryptosystem. This paper shows what those\ndynamical properties are and how a cryptanalyst can use them to prove the\ninadequacy of an encryption system for the secure exchange of information. This\nstudy is performed through the introduction of a series of mathematical tools\nwhich should be the basic framework of cryptanalysis in the context of digital\nchaos-based cryptography."

More precisely, we show that any 3-multiplicative\nLSSS is a strongly multiplicative LSSS, but the converse is not true; and that\nany strongly multiplicative LSSS can be efficiently converted into a\n3-multiplicative LSSS. Furthermore, we apply 3-multiplicative LSSS to the\ncomputation of unbounded fan-in multiplication, which reduces its round\ncomplexity to four (from five of the previous protocol based on strongly\nmultiplicative LSSS). We also give two constructions of 3-multiplicative LSSS\nfrom Reed-Muller codes and algebraic geometric codes.

    "summary": "Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of\nHarvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors.\nMica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets.\nStack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then\nexecute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code\ninjection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote\ncode injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program\nvulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory\nof an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that\npresents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only\nsucceeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting\npermanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the\ntarget sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that\ncan propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor\nbotnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented\nprogramming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and\nsuggest some counter-measures."

The objective of this paper is to\ndefine a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers\nrespectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The first abstraction\nlayer remains specific to a platform and a language. This first layer\ninterprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies\nthese operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in\nthe malware lifecycle. The second detection layer remains generic and is\ntotally interoperable between the different abstraction components. This layer\nrelies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are\nused for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow).\nTo feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two\ndifferent abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native\ncode and one processing the VBScript interpreted language. The different\nexperimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for\nscript files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process\ntraces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by\nmore sophisticated collection tools."

But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes,\nthese viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is\nthat Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New\nmodels have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but\nloosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a\nunified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the\nJoin-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the\nfundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for\ninteractions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more\ncomplex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly\nmodeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of\nundecidability and isolation still hold.

    "summary": "The role of mathematics in a complex system such as the Internet has yet to\nbe deeply explored. In this paper, we summarize some of the important and\npressing problems in cyber security from the viewpoint of open science\nenvironments. We start by posing the question \"What fundamental problems exist\nwithin cyber security research that can be helped by advanced mathematics and\nstatistics?\" Our first and most important assumption is that access to\nreal-world data is necessary to understand large and complex systems like the\nInternet. Our second assumption is that many proposed cyber security solutions\ncould critically damage both the openness and the productivity of scientific\nresearch. After examining a range of cyber security problems, we come to the\nconclusion that the field of cyber security poses a rich set of new and\nexciting research opportunities for the mathematical and statistical sciences."

    "summary": "Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the\npractice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality\nillegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called byte codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks . But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. We in this paper are proposing a framework named\nJConstHide for hiding constants, especially integers in the java source codes,\nto defeat reverse engineering through decompilation. To the best of our\nknowledge, no data hiding software are available for java source code constant\nhiding."

In particular, any parity-check relation\nderived from the periods of some constituent sequences usually leads to a\ndistinguishing attack whose complexity is determined by the bias of the\nrelation. However, estimating this bias is a difficult problem since the\npiling-up lemma cannot be used. Here, we give two exact expressions for this\nbias. Most notably, these expressions lead to a new algorithm for computing the\nbias of a parity-check relation, and they also provide some simple formulae for\nthis bias in some particular cases which are commonly used in cryptography."

Hand geometry,\none of the most well-known biometrics, is implemented in many verification\nsystems with various feature extraction methods. In recent work, a hand\ngeometry verification system using time series conversion techniques and\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure with Sakoe-Chiba band has been\nproposed. This system demonstrates many advantages, especially ease of\nimplementation and small storage space requirement using time series\nrepresentation.

We present improved cheater detection algorithms\nthat utilize natural delays that exist in long-term grid computations. In\nparticular, we partition the sequence of grid tasks into two interleaved\nsequences of task rounds, and we show how to use those rounds to devise the\nfirst general-purpose scheme that can catch all cheaters, even when cheaters\ncollude. The main idea of this algorithm might at first seem\ncounter-intuitive--we have the participants check each other's work. A naive\nimplementation of this approach would, of course, be susceptible to collusion\nattacks, but we show that by, adapting efficient solutions to the parallel\nprocessor diagnosis problem, we can tolerate collusions of lazy cheaters, even\nif the number of such cheaters is a fraction of the total number of\nparticipants. We also include a simple economic analysis of cheaters in grid\ncomputations and a parameterization of the main deterrent that can be used\nagainst them--the probability of being caught."

It can be accessed by various engines to facilitate agent\ncommunication. Further, in our operational ontologies, we define the mental\nattitudes of agents that can be shared among other agents. Our architecture\nenhanced the 3APL agent platform, and it is implemented as an agent\ncommunication framework. Finally, we extended the framework to be compatible\nwith the web ontology language for service (OWL-S), and then develop a movie\nrecommendation system with four OWL-S semantic web services on the framework.\nThe benefits of this work are: 1) dynamic web service coordination, 2)\nontological reasoning through uniform representation, namely, the declarative\ndescription, and 3) easy reuse and extension of both ontology and engine\nthrough extending ontology."

    "summary": "With the evolution of the Internet, multicast communications seem\nparticularly well adapted for large scale commercial distribution applications,\nfor example, the pay TV channels and secure videoconferencing. Key management\nfor multicast remains an open topic in secure Communications today. Key\nmanagement mainly has to do with the distribution and update of keying material\nduring the group life. Several key tree based approach has been proposed by\nvarious authors to create and distribute the multicast group key in effective\nmanner. There are different key management algorithms that facilitate efficient\ndistribution and rekeying of the group key. These protocols normally add\ncommunication overhead as well as computation overhead at the group key\ncontroller and at the group members. This paper explores the various algorithms\nalong with the performances and derives an improved method."

    "summary": "Memory corruption attacks remain the primary threat for computer security.\nInformation flow tracking or taint analysis has been proven to be effective\nagainst most memory corruption attacks. However, there are two shortcomings\nwith current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause\napplication slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second,\nthese techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do\nnot overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite\ncritical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to\naddress these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique\nthat uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects.\nWe propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by\nuntrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We\nperformed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it\ncan detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string\nattacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known\napproaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not\nrequire the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance\noverhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application\nslowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing\napproaches. Finally, since our approach performs run-time binary\ninstrumentation, it is easier to integrate it with existing applications and\nsystems."

    "summary": "The vast majority of RFID authentication protocols assume the proximity\nbetween readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel.\nHowever, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag)\nand the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover\nis in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in\nwhich scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included.\nDistance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder\nrelay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but\nvulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of\nthem. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with\nthe objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag\ncomputational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this\nprotocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an\nadversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack\nis very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s\nprotocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating\nprotocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient\nschemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and\ninspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously."

We present several protocols that allow a user to automatically\nrecover a password from a server using partial knowledge of the password. These\nprotocols can be easily adapted to the personal entropy setting, where a user\ncan recover a password only if he can answer a large enough subset of personal\nquestions.\n  We introduce client-server password recovery methods, in which the recovery\ndata are stored at the server, and the recovery procedures are integrated into\nthe login procedures. These methods apply to two of the most common types of\npassword based authentication systems. The security of these solutions is\nsignificantly better than the security of presently proposed password recovery\nschemes. Our protocols are based on a variation of threshold encryption that\nmay be of independent interest."

The security-related\nthreats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come\nin the form of blended attacks. It becomes difficult for any security system to\nblock all types of attacks. This gives rise to the need of an incidence\nhandling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents,\nminimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited\nand restoring the computing services. Incidence response has always been an\nimportant aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security\nadministrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle\nthe security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand\nany kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in\ncomputer, network and software which is required to build such a system."

Moreover, since\nthe underlying computations in HB protocols are very efficient, our protocol\nalso reduces reader load compared to PRF-based protocols.\n  We suggest a tree-based approach that replaces the PRF-based authentication\nfrom prior work with a procedure such as HB+ or HB#. We optimize the tree-\ntraversal stage through usage of a \"light version\" of the underlying protocol\nand shared random challenges across all levels of the tree.

    "summary": "Random number generation is a fundamental security primitive for RFID\ndevices. However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the\ncapacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must\nbe taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the\nimplementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag,\nwhich is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By\nrelating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication\nprotocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness\ntechniques on resource constrained devices."

Simulation results, using the ray-tracing tool WiSE to generate the\ntime-averaged response, verify the efficacy of the approach under realistic\nchannel conditions, as well as its capability to work under unknown channel\nvariations."

    "summary": "Today, Internet becomes the essential part of our lives. Over 90 percent of\nthe ecommerce is developed on the Internet. A security algorithm became very\nnecessary for producer client transactions assurance and the financial\napplications safety. The rsa algorithm applicability derives from algorithm\nproperties like confidentiality, safe authentication, data safety and integrity\non the internet. Thus, this kind of networks can have a more easy utilization\nby practical accessing from short, medium, even long distance and from\ndifferent public places. Rsa encryption in the client side is relatively cheap,\nwhereas, the corresponding decryption in the server side is expensive because\nits private exponent is much larger. Thus ssl tls servers become swamped to\nperform public key decryption operations when the simultaneous requests\nincrease quickly .The batch rsa method is useful for such highly loaded web\nserver .In our proposed algorithm by reducing the response time and clients\ntolerable waiting time an improvement in performance of ssl tls servers can be\ndone. The proposed algorithm should provide the reasonable response time and\noptimizes server performance significantly. At Encryption side, to withstand\nmany attacks like brute force attack, subtle attack etc. we also adapted a\nparameter generation method, which sieve all the parameters strictly, and\nfilter out every insecure parameter."

    "summary": "Many basic key distribution schemes specifically tuned to wireless sensor\nnetworks have been proposed in the literature. Recently, several researchers\nhave proposed schemes in which they have used group-based deployment models and\nassumed predeployment knowledge of the expected locations of nodes. They have\nshown that these schemes achieve better performance than the basic schemes, in\nterms of connectivity, resilience against node capture and storage\nrequirements. But in many situations expected locations of nodes are not\navailable. In this paper we propose a solution which uses the basic scheme, but\ndoes not use group-based deployment model and predeployment knowledge of the\nlocations of nodes, and yet performs better than schemes which make the\naforementioned assumptions.\n  In our scheme, groups are formed after deployment of sensor nodes, on the\nbasis of their physical locations, and the nodes sample keys from disjoint key\npools. Compromise of a node affects secure links with other nodes that are part\nof its group only. Because of this reason, our scheme performs better than the\nbasic schemes and the schemes using predeployment knowledge, in terms of\nconnectivity, storage requirement, and security. Moreover, the post-deployment\nkey generation process completes sooner than in schemes like LEAP+."

EFS supports secure storage at the system level through a\nstandard UNIX file system interface to encrypted files. User can associate a\ncryptographic key with the directories they wish to protect. Files in these\ndirectories (as well as their pathname components) are transparently encrypted\nand decrypted with the specified key without further user intervention; clear\ntext is never stored on a disk or sent to a remote file server. EFS can use any\navailable file system for its underlying storage without modifications,\nincluding remote file servers such as NFS. System management functions, such as\nfile backup, work in a normal manner and without knowledge of the key.\nPerformance is an important factor to users since encryption can be time\nconsuming. This paper describes the design and implementation of EFS in user\nspace using faster cryptographic algorithms on UNIX Operating system.\nImplementing EFS in user space makes it portable and flexible; Kernel size will\nalso not increase resulting in more reliable & efficient Operating System.\nEncryption techniques for file system level encryption are described, and\ngeneral issues of cryptographic system interfaces to support routine secure\ncomputing are discussed."

One of the consequences is that many people avoid e-commerce\nentirely due to privacy and security concerns. The solution is to perform\nauthentication without identification.

Although a number of\nprotocols for group key agreement have been proposed, most of them are not\napplicable in heterogeneous environment where a number of computationally\nlimited nodes coexist with one or more computationally efficient nodes.

This combination of operations was revealed later to be\ninsufficient for security. Then, Chien et al. proposed the SASI protocol [4]\nwith the aim of offering better security, by adding the bitwise rotation to the\nset of supported operations. The SASI protocol represented a milestone in the\ndesign of ultralightweight protocols, although certain attacks have been\npublished against this scheme [5, 6, 7]. In 2008, a new protocol, named\nGossamer [8], was proposed that can be considered a further development of both\nthe UMAP family and SASI. Although no attacks have been published against\nGossamer, Lee et al. [9] have recently published an alternative scheme that is\nhighly reminiscent of SASI. In this paper, we show that Lee et al.'s scheme\nfails short of many of its security objectives, being vulnerable to several\nimportant attacks like traceability, full disclosure, cloning and\ndesynchronization."

    "summary": "Privacy leaks are an unfortunate and an integral part of the current Internet\ndomain name resolution. Each DNS query generated by a user reveals -- to one or\nmore DNS servers -- the origin and target of that query. Over time, a user's\nbrowsing behavior might be exposed to entities with little or no trust. Current\nDNS privacy leaks stem from fundamental DNS features and are not easily fixable\nby simple patches. Moreover, privacy issues have been overlooked by DNS\nsecurity efforts (i.e. DNSSEC) and are thus likely to propagate into future\nversions of DNS.\n  In order to mitigate privacy issues in current DNS, this paper proposes a\nPrivacy-Preserving Domain Name System (PPDNS), which maintains privacy during\ndomain name resolution. PPDNS is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), an\nalternative naming infrastructure, and computational private information\nretrieval (cPIR), an advanced cryptographic construct. PPDNS takes advantage of\nthe DHT's index structure to improve name resolution query privacy, while\nleveraging cPIR to reduce communication overhead for bandwidth-sensitive\nclients. Our analysis shows that PPDNS is a viable approach for obtaining a\nhigher degree of privacy for name resolution queries. PPDNS also serves as a\ndemonstration of blending advanced systems techniques with their cryptographic\ncounterparts."

Our\nsolution involves changes (only) to the two gateway machines running IPsec.\n  In addition to their practical importance, our results also raise the\nchallenge of formally defining secure channels immune to DoS and degradation\nattacks, and providing provably-secure implementations."

The\nnovelty of our approach lies in the use of a polynomial mathematical model that\ncaptures the performance of classes of cryptographic algorithms instead of\ncapturing the performance of each algorithm separately, approach that is used\nin other papers. A major advantage of using such a model is that it does not\nrequire implementation-specific information, because the decision is based on\ncomparing the estimated performances of protocols instead of actually\nevaluating them. The approach is validated by comparatively evaluating the\nperformances of 1000 automatically generated security protocols against the\nperformances of their actual implementations."

    "summary": "Latest developments in VLSI, wireless communications, and biomedical sensing\ndevices allow very small, lightweight, low power, intelligent sensing devices\ncalled biosensors. A set of these devices can be integrated into a Wireless\nBiomedical Sensor Network (WBSN), a new breakthrough technology used in\ntelemedicine for monitoring the physiological condition of an individual. The\nbiosensor nodes in WBSN has got resource limitations in terms of battery\nlifetime, CPU processing capability, and memory capacity. Replacement or\nrecharging of batteries on thousands of biosensor nodes is quiet difficult or\ntoo costly. So, a key challenge in wireless biomedical sensor networks is the\nreduction of energy and memory consumption. Considering, the sensitivity of\ninformation in WBSN, we must provide security and patient privacy, as it is an\nimportant issue in the design of such systems. Hence this paper proposes an\nenergy efficient security protocol for WBSN where security is provided to the\nphysiological data, which is being transmitted from the sensor node to the sink\ndevice. This is achieved by authenticating the data using patients biometric,\nencrypting the data using Quasi Group cryptography after compressing the image\ndata using an energy efficient number theory based technique."

    "summary": "Over the recent years, IP and email spoofing gained much importance for\nsecurity concerns due to the current changes in manipulating the system\nperformance in different online environments. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nhas been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network\nand host based IDS approaches. However, the rapid growth of intrusion events\nover Internet and local area network become responsible for the distribution of\ndifferent threats and vulnerabilities in the computing systems. The current\nsignature detection approach used by IDS, detects unclear actions based on\nanalyzing and describing the action patterns such as time, text, password etc\nand has been faced difficulties in updating information, detect unknown novel\nattacks, maintenance of an IDS which is necessarily connected with analyzing\nand patching of security holes, and the lack of information on user privileges\nand attack signature structure. Thus, this paper proposes an EADS (Exception\nagent detection system) for securing the header information carried by IP over\nonline environments. The study mainly concerns with the deployment of new\ntechnique for detecting and eliminating the unknown threats attacks during the\ndata sharing over online environments."

In the first phase of the protocol, we\ndesign a trust based packet forwarding scheme for detecting and isolating the\nmalicious nodes using the routing layer information. It uses trust values to\nfavor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is\npunished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the\ntrust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding\nintermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we\nprovide link layer security using the CBCX mode of authentication and\nencryption. By simulation results, we show that the proposed cross layer\nsecurity protocol achieves high packet delivery ratio while attaining low delay\nand overhead."

The rapid advancement of Internet\ntechnology facilitates online trading, banking, downloading, emailing using\nresource-constrained handheld devices such as personal digital assistants and\ncell phones.

Consequently, a careful design of GSM security using both\nsymmetric and asymmetric key cryptography would make GSM security more\nadaptable in security intensive applications. This paper presents a secure and\nefficient protocol for GSM security using identity based cryptography. The\nsalient features of the proposed protocol are (i) authenticated key exchange;\n(ii) mutual authentication amongst communicating entities; and (iii) user\nanonymity. The security analysis of the protocol shows its strength against\nsome known threats observed in conventional GSM security."

In\ngeneral that survey indicated that corporate firewalls were often enforcing\npoorly written rule-sets, containing many mistakes.\n  The goal of this work is to revisit the first survey. The current study is\nmuch larger. Moreover, for the first time, the study includes configurations\nfrom two major vendors. The study also introduce a novel \"Firewall Complexity\"\n(FC) measure, that applies to both types of firewalls.\n  The findings of the current study indeed validate the 2004 study's main\nobservations: firewalls are (still) poorly configured, and a rule-set's\ncomplexity is (still) positively correlated with the number of detected risk\nitems. Thus we can conclude that, for well-configured firewalls, ``small is\n(still) beautiful''. However, unlike the 2004 study, we see no significant\nindication that later software versions have fewer errors (for both vendors)."

However since sensor networks are\nlimited to only collecting and reporting information regarding a certain event,\nand requires human intervention with that given information, it is often\ndifficult to react to an event or situation immediately and proactively. To\novercome this kind of limitation, Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs)\nwith immediate-response actor nodes have been proposed which adds greater\nmobility and activity to the existing sensor networks. Although WSANs share\nmany common grounds with sensor networks, it is difficult to apply existing\nsecurity technologies due to the fact that WSANs contain actor nodes that are\nresource-independent and mobile. Therefore, this research seeks to demonstrate\nways to provide security, integrity, and authentication services for WSANs\nsecure operation, by separating networks into hierarchical structure by each\nnode's abilities and provides different encryption key based secure protocols\nfor each level of hierarchy, Pairwise key, node key, and region key for sensor\nlevels, and public key for actor"

However, the fact that strong passwords are difficult to memorize\noften leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a\ncomputer file. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible\nalternative solution to textbased authentication, motivated particularly by the\nfact that humans can remember images better than text. In recent years, many\nnetworks, computer systems and Internet based environments try used graphical\nauthentication technique for their users authentication. All of graphical\npasswords have two different aspects which are usability and security.\nUnfortunately none of these algorithms were being able to cover both of these\naspects at the same time. In this paper, we described eight recognition based\nauthentication algorithms in terms of their drawbacks and attacks. In the next\nsection, the usability standards from ISO and the related attributes for\ngraphical user authentication usability are discussed. The related attack\npatterns for graphical user authentication security part are also discussed.\nFinally, a comparison table of all recognition based algorithms is presented\nbased on ISO and attack patterns standards."

When users input their passwords in a\npublic place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An\nattacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the\nindividuals authentication session. This is referred to as shouldersurfing and\nis a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. In\nthis paper we will present a survey on graphical password schemes from 2005\ntill 2009 which are proposed to be resistant against shoulder surfing attacks."

Therefore, different methods have been proposed so far for hiding\ninformation in different cover media. In this paper a method for hiding of\ninformation on the billboard display is presented. It is well known that\nencryption provides secure channels for communicating entities. However, due to\nlack of covertness on these channels, an eavesdropper can identify encrypted\nstreams through statistical tests and capture them for further cryptanalysis.\nIn this paper we propose a new form of steganography, on-line hiding of\ninformation on the output screens of the instrument. This method can be used\nfor announcing a secret message in public place. It can be extended to other\nmeans such as electronic advertising board around sports stadium, railway\nstation or airport. This method of steganography is very similar to image\nsteganography and video steganography. Private marking system using symmetric\nkey steganography technique and LSB technique is used here for hiding the\nsecret information."

    "summary": "Side channel attacks have emerged as a serious threat to the security of both\nnetworked and embedded systems -- in particular through the implementations of\ncryptographic operations. Side channels can be difficult to model formally, but\nwith careful coding and program transformation techniques it may be possible to\nverify security in the presence of specific side-channel attacks. But what if a\nprogram intentionally makes a tradeoff between security and efficiency and\nleaks some information through a side channel? In this paper we study such\ntradeoffs using ideas from recent research on declassification. We present a\nsemantic model of security for programs which allow for declassification\nthrough side channels, and show how side-channel declassification can be\nverified using off-the-shelf software model checking tools. Finally, to make it\nsimpler for verifiers to check that a program conforms to a particular\nside-channel declassification policy we introduce a further tradeoff between\nefficiency and verifiability: by writing programs in a particular \"manifest\nform\" security becomes considerably easier to verify."

    "summary": "This paper discusses the application of known techniques, knowledge and\ntechnology in a novel way for encryption. Two distinct and separate methods are\npresented.\n  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant\nsymbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more\ncommonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be\npossible. Hence, decryption will be possible.\n  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering\nto convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several\npossible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking\nanother language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.\nFibonacci, Phi or Prime.\n  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.\n  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.\nFirst the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.\n  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of\nplaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this\ntransitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with\nencrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It\nmay produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much\nmore computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force\ndecryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are\ncomputationally secure--impervious to brute force.\n  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.\n(Similar to adding random padding to the encryption.) However, this is\nacceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:\n  Both methods are not decryptable by method uncrackable - by conventional,\nstatistical means."

    "summary": "Increasing numbers of mobile computing devices, user-portable, or embedded in\nvehicles, cargo containers, or the physical space, need to be aware of their\nlocation in order to provide a wide range of commercial services. Most often,\nmobile devices obtain their own location with the help of Global Navigation\nSatellite Systems (GNSS), integrating, for example, a Global Positioning System\n(GPS) receiver. Nonetheless, an adversary can compromise location-aware\napplications by attacking the GNSS-based positioning: It can forge navigation\nmessages and mislead the receiver into calculating a fake location. In this\npaper, we analyze this vulnerability and propose and evaluate the effectiveness\nof countermeasures. First, we consider replay attacks, which can be effective\neven in the presence of future cryptographic GNSS protection mechanisms. Then,\nwe propose and analyze methods that allow GNSS receivers to detect the\nreception of signals generated by an adversary, and then reject fake locations\ncalculated because of the attack. We consider three diverse defense mechanisms,\nall based on knowledge, in particular, own location, time, and Doppler shift,\nreceivers can obtain prior to the onset of an attack. We find that inertial\nmechanisms that estimate location can be defeated relatively easy. This is\nequally true for the mechanism that relies on clock readings from off-the-shelf\ndevices; as a result, highly stable clocks could be needed. On the other hand,\nour Doppler Shift Test can be effective without any specialized hardware, and\nit can be applied to existing devices."

    "summary": "Internet worm infection continues to be one of top security threats and has\nbeen widely used by botnets to recruit new bots. In this work, we attempt to\nquantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key\ncharacteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the\nnumber of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree.\nSpecifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential\ngrowth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We\nanalytically and empirically find that the number of children has\nasymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on\naverage half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98%\nof infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of\ninfected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the\ngeneration follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length\nof the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with\nthe total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection\nstructure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the\nabove observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply\nour findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential\ncountermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer\ndiscovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that\ntargeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of\nchildren is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows\nthat when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots.\nHowever, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of\nchildren to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed\nof worm infection."

    "summary": "This paper presents a new protocol for Internet voting based on implicit data\nsecurity. This protocol allows recasting of votes, which permits a change of\nmind by voters either during the time window over which polling is open or\nduring a shorter period over which recasting is permitted. The security of\nvotes depends on multiple servers such that each vote is divided into\npartitions and these partitions are distributed among the servers, all of which\nneed to be brought together to reconstruct the votes. Such a protocol has\npotential applications in bargaining and electronic commerce."

    "summary": "The Discrete Logarithm Problem is well-known among cryptographers, for its\ncomputational hardness that grants security to some of the most commonly used\ncryptosystems these days. Still, many of these are limited to a small number of\ncandidate algebraic structures which permit implementing the algorithms. In\norder to extend the applicability of discrete-logarithm-based cryptosystems to\na much richer class of algebraic structures, we present a generalized form of\nexponential function. Our extension relaxes some assumptions on the exponent,\nwhich is no longer required to be an integer. Using an axiomatic\ncharacterization of the exponential function, we show how to construct mappings\nthat obey the same rules as exponentials, but can raise vectors to the power of\nother vectors in an algebraically sound manner. At the same time, computational\nhardness is not affected (in fact, the problem could possibly be strengthened).\nSetting up standard cryptosystems in terms of our generalized exponential\nfunction is simple and requires no change to the existing security proofs. This\nopens the field for building much more general schemes than the ones known so\nfar."

    "summary": "Nowadays, user authentication is one of the important topics in information\nsecurity. Text based strong password schemes could provide with certain degree\nof security. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to\nmemorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save\nthem in a computer file. Graphical user authentication (GUA) has been proposed\nas a possible alternative solution to text based authentication, motivated\nparticularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. In\nrecent years, many networks, computer systems and Internet based environments\ntry used GUA technique for their users authentication. All of GUA algorithms\nhave two different aspects which are usability and security. Unfortunately,\nnone of graphical algorithms were being able to cover both of these aspects at\nthe same time. This paper presents a wide range survey on the pure and cued\nrecall based algorithms in GUA, based on ISO standards for usability and attack\npatterns standards for security. After explain usability ISO standards and\nattack patterns international standards, we try to collect the major attributes\nof usability and security in GUA. Finally, try to make comparison tables among\nall recall based algorithms based on usability attributes and attack patterns\nthose we found."

    "summary": "In recent times, a necessity has been raised in order to distribute computing\napplications often across grids. These applications are dependent on the\nservices like data transfer or data portal services as well as submission of\njobs. Security is of utmost importance in grid computing applications as grid\nresources are heterogeneous, dynamic, and multidomain. Authentication remains\nas the significant security challenge in grid environment. In traditional\nauthentication protocol a single server stores the sensitive user credentials,\nlike username and password. When such a server is compromised, a large number\nof user passwords, will be exposed. Our proposed approach uses a dual\nauthentication protocol in order to improve the authentication service in grid\nenvironment. The protocol utilizes the fundamental concepts of trigon and based\non the parameters of the trigon the user authentication will be performed. In\nthe proposed protocol, the password is interpreted and alienated into more than\none unit and these units are stored in two different servers, namely,\nAuthentication Server and Backend Server. Only when the combined authentication\nscheme from both the servers authenticates the user, the privilege of accessing\nthe requested resources is obtained by the user. The main advantage of\nutilizing the dual authentication protocol in grid computing is that an\nadversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single\nconsolidated server because of the fact that the split password is stored in\ndifferent servers."

    "summary": "The malaise of electronic spam mail that solicit illicit partnership using\nbogus business proposals (popularly called 419 mails) remained unabated on the\ninternet despite concerted efforts. In addition to these are the emergence and\nprevalence of phishing scams that use social engineering tactics to obtain\nonline access codes such as credit card number, ATM pin numbers, bank account\ndetails, social security number and other personal information (22). In an age\nwhere dependence on electronic transaction is on the increase, the web security\ncommunity will have to devise more pragmatic measures to make the cyberspace\nsafe from these demeaning ills. Understanding the perpetrators of internet\ncrimes and their mode of operation is a basis for any meaningful effort towards\nstemming these crimes. This paper discusses the nature of the criminals engaged\nin fraudulent cyberspace activities with special emphasis on the Nigeria 419\nscam mails. Based on a qualitative analysis and experiments to trace the source\nof electronic spam and phishing emails received over a six months period, we\nprovide information about the scammers personalities, motivation, methodologies\nand victims. We posited that popular email clients are deficient in the\nprovision of effective mechanisms that can aid users in identifying fraud mails\nand protect them against phishing attacks. We demonstrate, using state of the\nart techniques, how users can detect and avoid fraudulent emails and conclude\nby making appropriate recommendations based on our findings."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a light-weight provably-secure authentication\nprotocol called the NLHB protocol, which is a variant of the HB protocol. The\nHB protocol uses the complexity of decoding linear codes for security against\npassive attacks. In contrast, security for the NLHB protocol is proved by\nreducing passive attacks to the problem of decoding a class of non-linear codes\nthat are provably hard. We demonstrate that the existing passive attacks on the\nHB protocol family, which have contributed to considerable reduction in its\neffective key-size, are ineffective against the NLHB protocol.\n  From the evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for the\nNLHB protocol to achieve the same level of passive attack security as the HB\nProtocol. Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation\ninstance for the NLHB protocol for which the Prover/Verifier complexity is\nlower than the HB protocol, enabling authentication on very low-cost devices\nlike RFID tags. Finally, in the spirit of the HB$^{+}$ protocol, we extend the\nNLHB protocol to the NLHB$^{+}$ protocol and prove security against the class\nof active attacks defined in the DET Model."

    "summary": "Digital watermarking consists on inserting a mark into an image to protect it\nagainst copies. The heaviness of the extraction procedure with the old methods\nurged us to look for a new algorithm in the singular values domain which would\nbe blind : it does not require the original image to extract the mark. We\npropose a new robust method which consists on inserting the bits of the mark\ninto the singular values matrix. Contrary to most of the watermarking\nalgorithms, it is blind and the results show that our method is robust against\nthe JPEG compression, the reduction of colors (GIF) and the histogram\nspreading. So, we were able to obtain PSNR = 49,63 dB."

A minutia matching is widely\nused for fingerprint recognition and can be classified as ridge ending and\nridge bifurcation. In this paper we projected Fingerprint Recognition using\nMinutia Score Matching method (FRMSM). For Fingerprint thinning, the Block\nFilter is used, which scans the image at the boundary to preserves the quality\nof the image and extract the minutiae from the thinned image. The false\nmatching ratio is better compared to the existing algorithm."

Security of SIP is\nan important consideration for VoIP communication as the traffic is transmitted\nover the insecure IP network.

However, due to the limitations in PKI based solutions, some PKI less\nauthentications mechanisms are proposed. This paper aims to present an overview\nof different authentication methods used in or together with SIP. We start by\nhighlighting the security issues in SIP in the context of VoIP communication.\nThen we illustrate the current activities regarding the SIP authentication\nmechanisms including the recent developments in the research community and\nstandardization efforts within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\nFinally we analyze the security aspects of these approaches."

A node, in wireless ad hoc network, counts always on intermediate nodes\nto send these packets to a given destination node. An intermediate node, which\ntakes part in packets forwarding, may behave maliciously and drop packets which\ngoes through it, instead of forwarding them to the following node. Such\nbehavior is called black hole attack. In this paper, after having specified the\nblack hole attack, a secure mechanism, which consists in checking the good\nforwarding of packets by an intermediate node, was proposed. The proposed\nsolution avoids the black hole and the cooperative black hole attacks.\nEvaluation metrics were considered in simulation to show the effectiveness of\nthe suggested solution."

As an example\nstrategy, we present Bluff ads; a class of ads that join forces in order to\nincrease the effort level for click-fraud spammers. Bluff ads are either\ntargeted ads, with irrelevant display text, or highly relevant display text,\nwith irrelevant targeting information. They act as a litmus test for the\nlegitimacy of the individual clicking on the ads. Together with standard\nthreshold-based methods, fake ads help to decrease click-fraud levels."

    "summary": "Human users have a tough time remembering long cryptographic keys. Hence,\nresearchers, for so long, have been examining ways to utilize biometric\nfeatures of the user instead of a memorable password or passphrase, in an\neffort to generate strong and repeatable cryptographic keys. Our objective is\nto incorporate the volatility of the users biometric features into the\ngenerated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking\nsignificant knowledge of the users biometrics. We go one step further trying to\nincorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation so\nas to provide better security. In this article, we propose an efficient\napproach based on multimodal biometrics (Iris and fingerprint) for generation\nof secure cryptographic key. The proposed approach is composed of three modules\nnamely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and\n3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and\ntexture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template. For\nexperimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly\navailable sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

With the evolution of new applications\nsuch as mobile commerce, it is essential to provide secure and efficient\nsolutions for the mobile environments. The traditional public key cryptography\ninvolves huge computational costs and is not so suitable for the\nresource-constrained platforms. The elliptic curve-based approaches as the\nnewer solutions require certain considerations that are not taken into account\nin the traditional public key infrastructures. The main contribution of this\npaper is to introduce a Lightweight Public Key Infrastructure (LPKI) for the\nconstrained platforms such as mobile phones. It takes advantages of elliptic\ncurve cryptography and signcryption to decrease the computational costs and\ncommunication overheads, and adapting to the constraints. All the computational\ncosts of required validations can be eliminated from end-entities by\nintroduction of a validation authority to the introduced infrastructure and\ndelegating validations to such a component. LPKI is so suitable for mobile\nenvironments and for applications such as mobile commerce where the security is\nthe great concern."

A secure and efficient mechanism is provided\nto convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original data at\nthe receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is, for solving the\n\"jigsaw puzzle\". The algorithm is designed to provide information-theoretic\n(that is, unconditional) security by the use of a one-time pad like scheme so\nthat no intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. A\nparallelizable design has been adopted for the implementation. An\nauthentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet."

First of all we reexamine classical assumptions made by\nscalar multiplication designers and we point out that some of them are not\nrelevant in the context of embedded devices. We then describe the\nstate-of-the-art of atomic scalar multiplication and propose an atomic pattern\nimprovement method.

A fast and compact FPGA based implementation of the Data Encryption\nStandard (DES) and Triple DES algorithm is presented in this paper that is\nwidely used in cryptography for securing the Internet traffic in modern day\ncommunication systems. The design of the digital cryptographic circuit was\nimplemented in a Vertex 5 series (XCVLX5110T) target device with the use of\nVHDL as the hardware description language. In order to confirm the expected\nbehavior of these algorithms, the proposed design was extensively simulated,\nsynthesized for different FPGA devices both in Spartan and Virtex series from\nXilinx viz. Spartan 3, Spartan 3AN, Virtex 5, Virtex E device families. The\nnovelty and contribution of this work is in three folds: (i) Extensive\nsimulation and synthesis of the proposed design targeted for various FPGA\ndevices, (ii) Complete hardware implementation of encryption and decryption\nalgorithms onto Virtex 5 series device (XCVLX5110T) based FPGA boards and,\n(iii) Generation of ICON and VIO core for the design and on chip verification\nand analyzing using Chipscope Pro. The experimental as well as implementation\nresults compared to the implementations reported so far are quite encouraging."

    "summary": "Many emerging applications in mobile adhoc networks involve group-oriented\ncommunication. Multicast is an efficient way of supporting group oriented\napplications, mainly in mobile environment with limited bandwidth and limited\npower. For using such applications in an adversarial environment as military,\nit is necessary to provide secure multicast communication. Key management is\nthe fundamental challenge in designing secure multicast communications. In many\nmulticast interactions, new member can join and current members can leave at\nany time and existing members must communicate securely using multicast key\ndistribution within constrained energy for mobile adhoc networks. This has to\novercome the challenging element of \"1 affects n\" problem which is due to high\ndynamicity of groups. Thus this paper shows the specific challenges towards\nmulticast key management protocols for securing multicast key distribution in\nmobile ad hoc networks, and present relevant multicast key management protocols\nin mobile ad hoc networks. A comparison is done against some pertinent\nperformance criteria."

In this paper, we\nsuggest a novel data hiding technique in an HTML Web page and also propose some\nsimple techniques to extend the embedding technique to source codes written in\nany programming language (both case insensitive like HTML, Pascal and case\nsensitive languages like C, C++, Java). We basically try to exploit the\ncase-redundancy in case-insensitive language, while we try hiding data with\nminimal changes in the source code (almost not raising suspicion). HTML Tags\nare case insensitive and hence an alphabet in lowercase and one in uppercase\npresent inside an HTML tag are interpreted in the same manner by the browser,\ni.e., change in case in a web page is imperceptible to the browser. We first\nexploit this redundancy and use it to embed secret data inside an web page,\nwith no changes visible to the user of the web page, so that he can not even\nsuspect about the data hiding. The embedded data can be recovered by viewing\nthe source of the HTML page. This technique can easily be extended to embed\nsecret message inside any piece of source-code where the standard interpreter\nof that language is case-insensitive.

Then we propose two novel embedding techniques, both of\nwhich are special-cases of our generalized model. The first embedding scheme is\nbased on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime numbers, while\nthe second one is based on decomposition in sum of natural numbers. Each of\nthese particular representations generates a different set of (virtual)\nbit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one\nto embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much\ndistortion, with a much better stego-image quality, in a reliable and secured\nmanner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A comparative\nperformance study between the classical Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the\ndata hiding technique using Fibonacci -p-Sequence decomposition and our\nproposed schemes has been done. Theoretical analysis indicates that image\nquality of the stego-image hidden by the technique using Fibonacci\ndecomposition improves against simple LSB substitution method, while the same\nusing the prime decomposition method improves drastically against that using\nFibonacci decomposition technique, and finally the natural number decomposition\nmethod is a further improvement against that using prime decomposition\ntechnique. Also, optimality for the last technique is proved. For both of our\ndata-hiding techniques, the experimental results show that, the stego-image is\nvisually indistinguishable from the original cover image."

    "summary": "Noninterference provides a control over information flow in a system for\nensuring confidentiality and integrity properties. In the literature this\nnotion has been well studied as transitive noninterference and intransitive\nnoninterference. In this paper we define a framework on the notion of\nconditional noninterference, which allows to specify information flow policies\nbased on the semantics of action channels. Our new policies subsume the\npolicies of both transitive and intransitive noninterference, and support\ndynamic requirements such as upgrading and downgrading.

This message digest is unique, irreversible and avoids all\ntypes of collisions for any given input string. The message digest calculated\nfrom this algorithm is propagated in the communication medium along with the\noriginal message from the sender side and on the receiver side integrity of the\nmessage can be verified by recalculating the message digest of the received\nmessage and comparing the two digest values. In this paper we have designed and\ndeveloped a new algorithm for calculating the message digest of any message and\nimplemented t using a high level programming language. An experimental analysis\nand comparison with the existing MD5 hashing algorithm, which is predominantly\nbeing used as a cryptographic hashing tool, shows this algorithm to provide\nmore randomness and greater strength from intrusion attacks. In this algorithm\nthe plaintext message string is converted into binary string and fragmented\ninto blocks of 128 bits after being padded with user defined padding bits. Then\nusing a pseudo random number generator a key is generated for each block and\noperated with the respective block by a bitwise operator. This process is\nterated for the whole message and finally a fixed length message digest is\nobtained."

Soft Input Decryption is a method of\ncombining SISO convolutional decoding and decrypting of cryptographic check\nvalues to improve the correction of errors in themselves. If Soft Input\nDecryption is successful, i.e. all wrong bit of a cryptographic check value are\ncorrected, these bit are sent as feedback information to the channel decoder\nfor a next iteration. The bit of the next iteration are corrected by channel\ndecoding followed by another Soft Input Decryption. Iterative Soft Input\nDecryption uses interleaved blocks. If one block can be corrected by Soft Input\nDecryption, the decoding of the interleaved block is improved (serial scheme).\nIf Soft Input Decryption is applied on both blocks and one of the blocks can be\ncorrected, the corrected block is used for an improved decoding of the other\nblock (parallel scheme).

    "summary": "Botnet is most widespread and occurs commonly in today's cyber attacks,\nresulting in serious threats to our network assets and organization's\nproperties. Botnets are collections of compromised computers (Bots) which are\nremotely controlled by its originator (BotMaster) under a common\nCommand-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. They are used to distribute commands\nto the Bots for malicious activities such as distributed denial-of-service\n(DDoS) attacks, spam and phishing. Most of the existing Botnet detection\napproaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&C)\nprotocols (e.g., IRC,HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become\nineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&C techniques. In this paper\nat first we provide taxonomy of Botnets C&C channels and evaluate well-known\nprotocols which are being used in each of them. Then we proposed a new general\ndetection framework which currently focuses on P2P based and IRC based Botnets.\nThis proposed framework is based on definition of Botnets. Botnet has been\ndefined as a group of bots that perform similar communication and malicious\nactivity patterns within the same Botnet. The point that distinguishes our\nproposed detection framework from many other similar works is that there is no\nneed for prior knowledge of Botnets such as Botnet signature."

    "summary": "According to actual needs, generalized signcryption scheme can flexibly work\nas an encryption scheme, a signature scheme or a signcryption scheme. In this\npaper, firstly, we give a security model for identity based generalized\nsigncryption which is more complete than existing model. Secondly, we propose\nan identity based generalized signcryption scheme. Thirdly, we give the\nsecurity proof of the new scheme in this complete model. Comparing with\nexisting identity based generalized signcryption, the new scheme has less\nimplementation complexity. Moreover, the new scheme has comparable computation\ncomplexity with the existing normal signcryption schemes."

    "summary": "Biometrics deal with automated methods of identifying a person or verifying\nthe identity of a person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics.\nVisual cryptography is a secret sharing scheme where a secret image is\nencrypted into the shares which independently disclose no information about the\noriginal secret image. As biometric template are stored in the centralized\ndatabase, due to security threats biometric template may be modified by\nattacker. If biometric template is altered authorized user will not be allowed\nto access the resource. To deal this issue visual cryptography schemes can be\napplied to secure the iris template. Visual cryptography provides great means\nfor helping such security needs as well as extra layer of authentication."

In this paper, a specific image based steganography technique for\ncommunicating information more securely between two locations is proposed. The\nauthor incorporated the idea of secret key and password security features for\nauthentication at both ends in order to achieve high level of security. As a\nfurther improvement of security level, the information has been permuted,\nencoded and then finally embedded on an image to form the stego image. In\naddition segmented objects extraction and reassembly of the stego image through\nnormalized cut method has been carried out at the sender side and receiver side\nrespectively in order to prevent distortion of the Stego image during\ntransmission."

    "summary": "In (k, n) visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, secret image can be visually\nreconstructed when k or more participants printing theirs shares on\ntransparencies and stack them together. No secret is revealed with fewer than k\nshares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality\nof the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original\nsecret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is\nprinted on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment\nor the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that\nin the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this\nalignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may\nstill be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the\nhorizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to\nconstruct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks\nfor the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of\nredundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme\nthat allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and\nvertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the\nreconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a\nshift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the\ntraditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very\nlittle shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method\ninvolves a larger pixel expansion. The basic building block of our scheme is\nduplication and concatenation of certain rows or columns of the basic matrices.\nThis seemingly simple but very powerful construction principle can be easily\nused to create more general (k, n)-VSS schemes."

    "summary": "Asymmetric password based key exchange is a key exchange protocol where a\nclient and a server share a low entropic password while the server additionally\nowns a high entropic secret for a public key. There are simple solutions for\nthis (e.g. Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and its improvement by\nBoyarsky (CCS 1999)). In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of\nprotocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to\ncryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\\em\nquickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,\none should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary\nattack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key\nexchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high\nentropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer\nfrom this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.\nHowever, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only\nconsider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study\nefficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new\nthreat. In this paper, we first provide a formal model for the new threat,\nwhere essentially we require that the active adversary can break $\\ell$\npasswords in $\\alpha\\ell |{\\cal D}|$ steps (for $\\alpha<1/2$) only with a\nprobability negligibly close to $\\exp(-\\beta\\ell)$ for some $\\beta>0$. Then, we\nconstruct a framework of asymmetric password based key exchange. We prove that\nour protocol is secure in the usual sense. We also show that it prevents the\nnew threat. To do this, we introduce a new technique by abstracting a\nprobabilistic experiment from the main proof and providing a neat analysis of\nit."

Messaging\nprotocols such as Mix-nets and DC-nets leave online groups vulnerable to\ndenial-of-service and Sybil attacks, while accountable voting protocols are\nunusable or inefficient for general anonymous messaging.\n  We present the first general messaging protocol that offers provable\nanonymity with accountability for moderate-size groups, and efficiently handles\nunbalanced loads where few members have much data to transmit in a given round.\nThe N group members first cooperatively shuffle an NxN matrix of pseudorandom\nseeds, then use these seeds in N \"pre-planned\" DC-nets protocol runs. Each\nDC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one member's\nmessage, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity under our\nattack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and one-to-one\ncorrespondence between members and messages, makes denial-of-service attacks by\nmembers traceable to the culprit, and efficiently handles large and unbalanced\nmessage loads. A working prototype demonstrates the protocol's practicality for\nanonymous messaging in groups of 40+ member nodes."

Among those linear\nautomata, a particular case of study is Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs)\nused in many cryptographic applications such as design of stream ciphers or\npseudo-random generation. LFSRs could be seen as particular LFSMs without\ninputs.\n  In this paper, we first recall the description of LFSMs using traditional\nmatrices representation. Then, we introduce a new matrices representation with\npolynomial fractional coefficients. This new representation leads to sparse\nrepresentations and implementations. As direct applications, we focus our work\non the Windmill LFSRs case, used for example in the E0 stream cipher and on\nother general applications that use this new representation.\n  In a second part, a new design criterion called diffusion delay for LFSRs is\nintroduced and well compared with existing related notions. This criterion\nrepresents the diffusion capacity of an LFSR. Thus, using the matrices\nrepresentation, we present a new algorithm to randomly pick LFSRs with good\nproperties (including the new one) and sparse descriptions dedicated to\nhardware and software designs.

Identified new threats and suggested countermeasures may be\nused as a supplement to RFC 5062, which describes security attacks in SCTP\nprotocol and can induce further standard modifications."

    "summary": "This paper presents a new steganographic method called WiPad (Wireless\nPadding). It is based on the insertion of hidden data into the padding of\nframes at the physical layer of WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks). A\nperformance analysis based on a Markov model, previously introduced and\nvalidated by the authors in [10], is provided for the method in relation to the\nIEEE 802.11 a/g standards. Its results prove that maximum steganographic\nbandwidth for WiPad is as high as 1.1 Mbit/s for data frames and 0.44 Mbit/s\nfor acknowledgment (ACK) frames. To the authors' best knowledge this is the\nmost capacious of all the known steganographic network channels."

    "summary": "Many significant functionalities of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)\nrequire that nodes have knowledge of the positions of other vehicles, and\nnotably of those within communication range. However, adversarial nodes could\nprovide false position information or disrupt the acquisition of such\ninformation. Thus, in VANETs, the discovery of neighbor positions should be\nperformed in a secure manner. In spite of a multitude of security protocols in\nthe literature, there is no secure discovery protocol for neighbors positions.\nWe address this problem in our paper: we design a distributed protocol that\nrelies solely on information exchange among one-hop neighbors, we analyze its\nsecurity properties in presence of one or multiple (independent or colluding)\nadversaries, and we evaluate its performance in a VANET environment using\nrealistic mobility traces. We show that our protocol can be highly effective in\ndetecting falsified position information, while maintaining a low rate of false\npositive detections."

Our work is\nbased on traditional (k +1; n)-threshold secret sharing, which is secure as\nlong as an adversary can compromise not more than k secret shares. But in real\nlife it is often feasible for an adversary to obtain more than k shares over a\nlong period of time.

The\nuse of Elliptic Curve Cryptography makes the computations easier and faster in\nour work."

A user can test and modify complex scenarios, with several\ninterconnected networks, where the attacker has no initial connectivity with\nthe objective of the attack.

    "summary": "An application security has two primary goals: first, it is intended to\nprevent unauthorised personnel from accessing information at higher\nclassification than their authorisation. Second, it is intended to prevent\npersonnel from declassifying information. Using an object oriented approach to\nimplementing application security results not only with the problem of code\nscattering and code tangling, but also results in weaker enforcement of\nsecurity. This weaker enforcement of security could be due to the inherent\ndesign of the system or due to a programming error. Aspect Oriented Programming\n(AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of\nthinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the\nclass, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. The goal of the\npaper is to present that Aspect Oriented Programming AspectJ integrated with\nSpring AOP provides very powerful mechanisms for stronger enforcement of\nsecurity.Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allows weaving a security aspect\ninto an application providing additional security functionality or introducing\ncompletely new security mechanisms.Implementation of security with AOP is a\nflexible method to develop separated, extensible and reusable pieces of code\ncalled aspects.In this comparative study paper, we argue that Spring AOP\nprovides stronger enforcement of security than AspectJ.We have shown both\nSpring AOP and AspectJ strive to provide a comprehensive AOP solutions and\ncomplements each other."

These\ncompanies are obliged by law to keep a data processing legal for all offered\nservices. They need to fulfill different security objectives specified by the\nlegislation. Therefore, they control access to prevent unauthorized users from\nusing data. Those security objectives, for example confidentiality or secrecy,\nare often defined in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language that\npromotes interoperability between different systems. In this paper, we show the\nnecessity of incorporating the requirements of legislation into access control.\nBased on the work flow in a banking scenario we describe a variety of available\ncontextual information and their interrelations. Different from other access\ncontrol systems our main focus is on law-compliant cross-border data access. By\nincluding legislation directly into access decisions, this lawfulness can be\nensured. We also describe our information model to demonstrate how these\npolicies can be implemented into an existing network and how the components and\ncontextual information interrelate.

However,\nas an outcome of its low cost, RFID based inventory control is susceptible to\npernicious security and privacy threats. A deleterious attack on such a system\nis corporate espionage, where attackers through illicit inventorying infer\nsales and restocking trends for products. In this paper, we first present\nplausible aftermaths of corporate espionage using real data from online\nsources. Second, to mitigate corporate espionage in a retail store environment,\nwe present a simple lowcost system called Mirage. Mirage uses additional\nprogrammable low cost passive RFID tags called honeytokens to inject noise in\nretail store inven-torying. Using a simple history based algorithm that\ncontrols activation and de-activation of honeytokens, Mirage randomizes sales\nand restocking trends. We evaluate Mirage in a real warehouse environment using\na commercial off-the-shelf Motorola MC9090 handheld RFID reader and over 450\nGen2 low cost RFID tags. We show that Mirage successfully flattens and\nrandomizes sales and restocking trends while adding minimal cost to inventory\ncontrol."

    "summary": "With the discovery of new exploit techniques, novel protection mechanisms are\nneeded as well. Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR\n(Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult\nenvironment for exploitation. Attackers, however, have recently researched new\nexploitation methods which are capable of bypassing the operating system's\nmemory mitigations. One of the newest and most popular exploitation techniques\nto bypass both of the aforementioned security protections is JIT memory\nspraying, introduced by Dion Blazakis. In this article we will present a short\noverview of the JIT spraying technique and also novel mitigation methods\nagainst this innovative class of attacks. An anti-JIT spraying library was\ncreated as part of our shellcode execution prevention system."

There are many cryptography techniques\navailable; among them AES is one of the most powerful techniques. In\nSteganography we have various techniques in different domains like spatial\ndomain, frequency domain etc. to hide the message. It is very difficult to\ndetect hidden message in frequency domain and for this domain we use various\ntransformations like DCT, FFT and Wavelets etc. In this project we are\ndeveloping a system where we develop a new technique in which Cryptography and\nSteganography are used as integrated part along with newly developed enhanced\nsecurity module. In Cryptography we are using AES algorithm to encrypt a\nmessage and a part of the message is hidden in DCT of an image; remaining part\nof the message is used to generate two secret keys which make this system\nhighly secured.

    "summary": "Almost all known secret sharing schemes work on numbers. Such methods will\nhave difficulty in sharing graphs since the number of graphs increases\nexponentially with the number of nodes. We propose a secret sharing scheme for\ngraphs where we use graph intersection for reconstructing the secret which is\nhidden as a sub graph in the shares. Our method does not rely on heavy\ncomputational operations such as modular arithmetic or polynomial interpolation\nbut makes use of very basic operations like assignment and checking for\nequality, and graph intersection can also be performed visually. In certain\ncases, the secret could be reconstructed using just pencil and paper by\nauthorised parties but cannot be broken by an adversary even with unbounded\ncomputational power. The method achieves perfect secrecy for (2, n) scheme and\nrequires far fewer operations compared to Shamir's algorithm. The proposed\nmethod could be used to share objects such as matrices, sets, plain text and\neven a heterogeneous collection of these. Since we do not require a previously\nagreed upon encoding scheme, the method is very suitable for sharing\nheterogeneous collection of objects in a dynamic fashion."

As soon as the code has been disassemblied/decompiled (including a\ndynamic analysis step), there is a hope to understand what the malware actually\ndoes and to implement a detection mean. This also applies to protection of\nsoftware whenever one wishes to analyze them. In this paper, we show how to\namour code in such a way that reserse engineering techniques (static and\ndymanic) are absolutely impossible by combining malicious cryptography\ntechniques developped in our laboratory and new types of programming (k-ary\ncodes). Suitable encryption algorithms combined with new cryptanalytic\napproaches to ease the protection of (malicious or not) binaries, enable to\nprovide both total code armouring and large scale polymorphic features at the\nsame time. A simple 400 Kb of executable code enables to produce a binary code\nand around $2^{140}$ mutated forms natively while going far beyond the old\nconcept of decryptor."

A classification of grammars has been\nmade by Noam Chomsky, which led to four well-known types. Yet, there are other\ntypes of grammars, which do not exactly fit in Chomsky's classification, such\nas the two-level grammars. As their name suggests it, the main idea behind\nthese grammars is that they are composed of two grammars. Van Wijngaarden\ngrammars, particularly, are such grammars. They are interesting by their power\n(expressiveness), which can be the same, under some hypotheses, as the most\npowerful grammars of Chomsky's classification, i.e. Type 0 grammars. Another\npoint of interest is their relative conciseness and readability. Van\nWijngaarden grammars can describe static and dynamic semantic of a language.\nSo, by using them as a generative engine, it is possible to generate a possibly\ninfinite set of words, while assuring us that they all have the same semantic.\nMoreover, they can describe K-ary codes, by describing the semantic of each\ncomponents of a code."

The idea is that each device is insecure by itself, since in\nmany cases it is incapable of checking its safety by itself (e.g. when it is\ncompromised it may lose its ability to monitor its own trustworthiness), but\ntogether, they can ensure each other's security in a collaborative manner."

    "summary": "Chaotic communications based on semiconductor lasers have aroused great\nresearch interest since 1990s. Physical-layer encryption using chaotic lasers\nis an alternative to transmit message rapidly and confidentially. There are\nsome practical devices and setups for optical chaotic communications, which are\nintuitively considered to be secure. However, there is lack of a set of\nsecurity evaluation rules for these communication setups. According to the\nrecent literature, we summarize several criteria for optical chaotic\ncommunications to evaluate the security and point out some methods to enhance\nthe security. These criteria and suggested rules are very helpful in designing\nsecure communication systems using chaotic lasers. Finally we propose some\npossible hot topics on security analysis of optical chaotic communications in\nfuture."

    "summary": "Intrusion detection systems have become a key component in ensuring the\nsafety of systems and networks. As networks grow in size and speed continues to\nincrease, it is crucial that efficient scalable techniques should be developed\nfor IDS systems. Signature based detection is the most extensively used threat\ndetection technique for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). One of the foremost\nchallenges for signaturebased IDS systems is how to keep up with large volume\nof incoming traffic when each packet needs to be compared with every signature\nin the database. When an IDS cannot keep up with the traffic flood, all it can\ndo is to drop packets, therefore, may miss potential attacks. This paper\nproposes a new model called Dynamic Multi-Layer Signature based IDS using\nMobile Agents, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by\ndynamically and automatically creating and using small and efficient multiple\ndatabases, and at the same time, provide mechanism to update these small\nsignature databases at regular intervals using Mobile Agents"

    "summary": "In a multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) mobile nodes communicate with\neach other forming a cooperative radio network. Security remains a major\nchallenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically\nchanging topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized\nmonitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the\ncurrently existing security algorithms designed for these networks are\ninsecure, in efficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes'\nmisbehaviour. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the\ncomplementary relationship between key distribution and misbehaviour detection\nfor developing an integrated security solution for MANETs. The redundancy of\nrouting information in ad hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable\nprotocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and\nByzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully co-operative, and\nthus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used\nfor choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed protocol."

The problem of protecting such\ninformation can be divided into two main subclasses, namely, individual and\ngroup data anonymity. By group anonymity we define protecting important data\npatterns, distributions, and collective features which cannot be determined\nthrough analyzing individual records only. An effective and comparatively\nsimple way of solving group anonymity problem is doubtlessly applying wavelet\ntransform. It's easy-to-implement, powerful enough, and might produce\nacceptable results if used properly. In the paper, we present a novel method of\nusing wavelet transform for providing group anonymity; it is gained through\nredistributing wavelet approximation values, along with simultaneous fixing\ndata mean value and leaving wavelet details unchanged (or proportionally\naltering them). Moreover, we provide a comprehensive example to illustrate the\nmethod."

These networks have the potential to provide robust and\nhigh-throughput data delivery to wireless users. In a WMN, high speed routers\nequipped with advanced antennas, communicate with each other in a multi-hop\nfashion over wireless channels and form a broadband backhaul. However, the\nthroughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish\nrouters that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their\nown traffic through the network. This paper presents an algorithm for detection\nof selfish nodes in a WMN. It uses statistical theory of inference for reliable\nclustering of the nodes and is based on local observations by the nodes.\nSimulation results show that the algorithm has a high detection rate while\nhaving a low rate of false positives."

The MRZ has two lines of the holder's\npersonal data, some document data, and verification characters encoded using\nthe Optical Character Recognition font B (OCRB). The encoded data includes the\nholder's name, date of birth, and other identifying information for the holder\nor the document. The VIZ contains the holder's photo and signature, usually on\nthe data page. However, the MRZ and VIZ can be easily duplicated with normal\ndocument reproduction technology to produce a fake passport which can pass\ntraditional verification. Neither of these features actively verify the\nholder's identity; nor do they bind the holder's identity to the document. A\npassport also contains pages for stamps of visas and of country entry and exit\ndates, which can be easily altered to produce fake permissions and travel\nrecords. The electronic passport, supporting authentication using secure\ncredentials on a tamper-resistant chip, is an attempt to improve on the\nsecurity of the paper-based passport at minimum cost.

Nevertheless, the wide deployment of LBSs can\njeopardize the location privacy of mobile users. Consequently, providing\nsafeguards for location privacy of mobile users against being attacked is an\nimportant research issue. In this paper a new scheme for safeguarding location\nprivacy is proposed. Our approach supports location K-anonymity for a wide\nrange of mobile users with their own desired anonymity levels by clustering.\nThe whole area of all users is divided into clusters recursively in order to\nget the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR). The exact location information of a\nuser is replaced by his MBR. Privacy analysis shows that our approach can\nachieve high resilience to location privacy threats and provide more privacy\nthan users expect. Complexity analysis shows clusters can be adjusted in real\ntime as mobile users join or leave. Moreover, the clustering algorithms possess\nstrong robustness."

    "summary": "We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and correctness,\nwithout assuming any bound on the number of corrupt participants. All protocols\nhave polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the\nprotocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first\nprotocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to\ncompute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that\nregardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned\nthrough the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation.\nUnfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in\nwhich case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the\ntally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the\ncommunication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and\nauthorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is\nalso limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single\nauthority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt\nauthority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final\nprotocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification\ntechnique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting\nthe protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding\nversions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security."

    "summary": "Secure distance bounding (DB) protocols allow one entity, the verifier, to\nsecurely obtain an upper-bound on the distance to another entity, the prover.\nThus far, DB was considered mostly in the context of a single prover and a\nsingle verifier. There has been no substantial prior work on secure DB in group\nsettings, where a set of provers interact with a set of verifiers. The need for\ngroup distance bounding (GDB) is motivated by many practical scenarios,\nincluding: group device pairing, location-based access control and secure\ndistributed localization. GDB is also useful in mission-critical networks and\nautomotive computer systems. This paper addresses, for the first time, GDB\nprotocols by utilizing the new passive DB primitive and the novel mutual\nmulti-party GDB protocol. We show how they can be used to construct secure and\nefficient GDB protocols for various settings. We analyze security and\nperformance of our protocols and compare them with existing DB techniques when\napplied to group settings."

    "summary": "A protocol for computing a functionality is secure if an adversary in this\nprotocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give\ntheir inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality\nto all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair --\nall parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness\nis not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility,\nGordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure\ncomputation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they\nconstruct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either\ntheir domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon\nand Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols.\n  We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general\nfunctionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when\nthe number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties\nare corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is\ndeterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security\nparameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the\nrange is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the\nfunctionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the\nnumber of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the\nnegative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant,\n1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is\npolynomial."

    "summary": "Using cryptography to protect information and communication has bacically two\nmajor drawbacks. First, the specific entropy profile of encrypted data makes\ntheir detection very easy. Second, the use of cryptography can be more or less\nregulated, not to say forbidden, according to the countries. If the right to\nfreely protect our personal and private data is a fundamental right, it must\nnot hinder the action of Nation States with respect to National security.\nAllowing encryption to citizens holds for bad guys as well.\n  In this paper we propose a new approach in information and communication\nsecurity that may solve all these issues, thus representing a rather\ninteresting trade-off between apparently opposite security needs. We introduce\nthe concept of scalable security based on computationnally hard problem of\ncoding theory with the PERSEUS technology.\n  The core idea is to encode date with variable punctured convolutional codes\nin such a way that any cryptanalytic attempt will require a time-consuming\nencoder reconstruction in order to decode. By adding noise in a suitable way,\nthat reconstruction becomes untractable in practice except for Intelligence\nservices that however must use supercomputers during a significant, scalable\namount of time. Hence it limits naturally any will to unduly performs such\nattacks (eg. against citizens' privacy).\n  On the users' side, encoder and noise parameters are first exchanged through\nan initial, short HTTPS session. The principles behind that approach have been\nmathematically validated in 1997 and 2007. We present the PERSEUS library we\nhave developed under the triple GPL/LGPL/MPL licences. This library can be used\nto protect any kind of data."

    "summary": "Computer network is unpredictable due to information warfare and is prone to\nvarious attacks. Such attacks on network compromise the most important\nattribute, the privacy. Most of such attacks are devised using special\ncommunication channel called \"Covert Channel\". The word \"Covert\" stands for\nhidden or non-transparent. Network Covert Channel is a concealed communication\npath within legitimate network communication that clearly violates security\npolicies laid down. The non-transparency in covert channel is also referred to\nas trapdoor. A trapdoor is unintended design within legitimate communication\nwhose motto is to leak information. Subliminal channel, a variant of covert\nchannel works similarly except that the trapdoor is set in a cryptographic\nalgorithm. A composition of covert channel with subliminal channel is the\n\"Hybrid Covert Channel\". Hybrid covert channel is homogenous or heterogeneous\nmixture of two or more variants of covert channels either active at same\ninstance or at different instances of time. Detecting such malicious channel\nactivity plays a vital role in removing threat to the legitimate network. In\nthis paper, we present a study of multi-trapdoor covert channels and introduce\ndesign of a new detection engine for hybrid covert channel in transport layer\nvisualized in TCP and SSL."

Security\nremains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open\nmedium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms,\nabsence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense.\nDesign of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such\nnetworks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven\nand resource constrained.

Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol is effective\neven in presence of large fraction of malicious nodes in the network. Moreover,\nit has a minimal computation and communication overhead that makes it ideally\nsuitable for MANETs."

    "summary": "Since it is impossible to predict and identify all the vulnerabilities of a\nnetwork, and penetration into a system by malicious intruders cannot always be\nprevented, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential entities for\nensuring the security of a networked system. To be effective in carrying out\ntheir functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given\nthese stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the\ncurrent days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging\ntask. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a\ndistributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks\ne.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this\npaper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of\nautonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect\nattacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes\nin the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The\nexperiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection\nefficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing\nsystems."

However, practical exploits of these weaknesses are complicated\nbecause of all the signal processing involved and have not been seen much\noutside of their use by law enforcement agencies.\n  This could change due to recently developed open-source equipment and\nsoftware that can capture and digitize signals from the GSM frequencies. This\nmight make practical attacks against GSM much simpler to perform.\n  Indeed, several claims have recently appeared in the media on successfully\neavesdropping on GSM. When looking at these claims in depth the conclusion is\noften that more is claimed than what they are actually capable of. However, it\nis undeniable that these claims herald the possibilities to eavesdrop on GSM\nusing publicly available equipment.\n  This paper evaluates the claims and practical possibilities when it comes to\neavesdropping on GSM, using relatively cheap hardware and open source\ninitiatives which have generated many headlines over the past year. The basis\nof the paper is extensive experiments with the USRP (Universal Software Radio\nPeripheral) and software projects for this hardware."

How to benefit from the adversary's\nuncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a\nconnection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create\nuncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done\n\"safely\", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This\nresult illustrates that \"hiding in a crowd of $k$\" indeed offers some privacy\nguarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output\nperturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random\nsampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to\nchange of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both\npositive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a\nrandom-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can\ngreatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset\nresulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the\nnegative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's\nuncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in\npractice."

    "summary": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a key technology for next\ngeneration wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring\nnumerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers\n(MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone\nthrough the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and\ncommunicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the\ninvolvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in\nWMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,\nstringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to\nsupport real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,\nreliable and efficient routing protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end\nlatency. Design of a secure and efficient routing protocol for WMNs, therefore,\nis of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable\nrouting protocol that also provides user anonymity in WMNs. The protocol is\nbased on an accurate estimation of the available bandwidth in the wireless\nlinks and a robust estimation of the end-to-end delay in a routing path, and\nminimization of control message overhead. The user anonymity, authentication\nand data privacy is achieved by application of a novel protocol that is based\non Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulations carried out on the proposed\nprotocol demonstrate that it is more efficient than some of the existing\nrouting protocols."

    "summary": "Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data\nanalysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on\nimplementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of\nformally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been\nadequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated\nverification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We\ndevelop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for\nsystems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main\ntechnical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of\nprobabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a\nprobabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the\nway we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family\ninstead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a\nrepresentative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is\nintended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to\napply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it\nto show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our\ndifferential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating\nour proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a\nrestricted class of relations from the proof technique."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a strict authentication watermarking for medical images.\nIn this scheme, we define region of interest (ROI) by taking the smallest\nrectangle around an image. The watermark is generated from hashing the area of\ninterest. The embedding region is considered to be outside the region of\ninterest as to preserve the area from distortion as a result from watermarking.\nThe strict authentication watermarking is robust to some degree of JPEG\ncompression (SAW-JPEG). JPEG compression will be reviewed. To embed a watermark\nin the spatial domain, we have to make sure that the embedded watermark will\nsurvive JPEG quantization process. The watermarking scheme, including data\nembedding, extracting and verifying procedure were presented. Experimental\nresults showed that such a scheme could embed and extract the watermark at a\nhigh compression rate. The watermark is robust to a high compression rate up to\n90.6%. The JPEG image quality threshold is 60 for the least significant bit\nembedding. The image quality threshold is increased to 61 for 2nd and 3rd LSB\nmanipulations."

    "summary": "Suppose you find the same username on different online services, what is the\nprobability that these usernames refer to the same physical person? This work\naddresses what appears to be a fairly simple question, which has many\nimplications for anonymity and privacy on the Internet. One possible way of\nestimating this probability would be to look at the public information\nassociated to the two accounts and try to match them. However, for most\nservices, these information are chosen by the users themselves and are often\nvery heterogeneous, possibly false and difficult to collect. Furthermore,\nseveral websites do not disclose any additional public information about users\napart from their usernames (e.g., discus- sion forums or Blog comments),\nnonetheless, they might contain sensitive information about users. This paper\nexplores the possibility of linking users profiles only by looking at their\nusernames. The intuition is that the probability that two usernames refer to\nthe same physical person strongly depends on the \"entropy\" of the username\nstring itself. Our experiments, based on crawls of real web services, show that\na significant portion of the users' profiles can be linked using their\nusernames. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that usernames\nare considered as a source of information when profiling users on the Internet."

    "summary": "Security becomes an extremely important issue in smart grid. To maintain the\nsteady operation for smart power grid, massive measurement devices must be\nallocated widely among the power grid. Previous studies are focused on false\ndata injection attack to the smart grid system. In practice, false data\ninjection attack is not easy to implement, since it is not easy to hack the\npower grid data communication system. In this paper, we demonstrate that a\nnovel time stamp attack is a practical and dangerous attack scheme for smart\ngrid. Since most of measurement devices are equipped with global positioning\nsystem (GPS) to provide the time information of measurements, it is highly\nprobable to attack the measurement system by spoofing the GPS. By employing the\nreal measurement data in North American Power Grid, simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the time stamp attack on smart grid."

Reversibility signifies that the original media can be recovered\nwithout any loss from the marked media after extracting the embedded message.\nThis paper presents a new method that adopts two-level wavelet transform and\nexploits the feature of large wavelet coefficient variance to achieve the goal\nof high capacity with imperceptibility. Our method differs from those of\nprevious ones in which the wavelet coefficients histogram not gray-level\nhistogram is manipulated. Besides, clever shifting rules are introduced into\nhistogram to avoid the decimal problem in pixel values after recovery to\nachieve reversibility. With small alteration of the wavelet coefficients in the\nembedding process, and therefore low visual distortion is obtained in the\nmarked image. In addition, an important feature of our design is that the use\nof threshold is much different from previous studies. The results indicate that\nour design is superior to many other state-of-the-art reversible data hiding\nschemes."

    "summary": "Smartphone apps often run with full privileges to access the network and\nsensitive local resources, making it difficult for remote systems to have any\ntrust in the provenance of network connections they receive. Even within the\nphone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one\nanother, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its\nprivileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security\nmechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain\nof IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges\nof its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight\nsignature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be\nverified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in\nnetwork RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone\nwhen an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example\napplications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app\nwhich wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its\nhost. We also built a payment service, allowing an app to issue a request which\nthe payment service validates with the user. An app cannot not forge a payment\nrequest by directly connecting to the remote server, nor can the local payment\nservice tamper with the request."

    "summary": "In this paper we discuss the ability of channel codes to enhance\ncryptographic secrecy. Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of\ndegrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is\nsimilar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific\npractical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the\nciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system\nsetup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through\nindependent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ\n(Automatic Repeat reQuest). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic\nlow-density parity-check codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper\nwith stopping sets in the decoder. Furthermore, the design amplifies errors\nwhen stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased\nbits correctly to avoid an expected error rate of one half in the ciphertext.\nWe extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that\nreduces the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood attack to that of a\nmessage-passing attack. We further extend security analysis to models with\nmultiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is\nenhanced in all these cases by exploiting properties of the physical-layer. The\nenhancement is accurately presented as a function of the degrees of freedom in\nthe eavesdropper's knowledge of the ciphertext, and is even shown to be present\nwhen eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers."

Security enhancements at the physical layer\nhave been proposed recently using a secrecy metric based on the degrees of\nfreedom that an attacker has with respect to the sent ciphertext. Prior work\nfocused on cases in which the wiretap channel could be modeled as statistically\nindependent packet erasure channels for the legitimate receiver and an\neavesdropper. In this paper, we go beyond the state-of-the-art by addressing\ncorrelated erasure events across the two communication channels. The resulting\nsecurity enhancement is presented as a function of the correlation coefficient\nand the erasure probabilities for both channels. It is shown that security\nimprovements are achievable by means of judicious physical-layer design even\nwhen the eavesdropper has a better channel than the legitimate receiver. The\nonly case in which this assertion may not hold is when erasures are highly\ncorrelated across channels. However, we are able to prove that correlation\ncannot nullify the expected security enhancement if the channel quality of the\nlegitimate receiver is strictly better than that of the eavesdropper."

    "summary": "A bandwidth puzzle was recently proposed to defend against colluding\nadversaries in peer-to-peer networks. The colluding adversaries do not do\nactual work but claim to have uploaded contents for each other to gain free\ncredits from the system. The bandwidth puzzle guarantees that if the\nadversaries can solve the puzzle, they must have spent substantial bandwidth,\nthe size of which is comparable to the size of the contents they claim to have\nuploaded for each other. Therefore, the puzzle discourages the collusion. In\nthis paper, we study the performance of the bandwidth puzzle and give a lower\nbound on the average number of bits the adversaries must receive to be able to\nsolve the puzzles with a certain probability. We show that our bound is tight\nin the sense that there exists a strategy to approach this lower bound\nasymptotically within a small factor.

For example, regulations, such as\nHIPAA, require that hospital employees use medical information for only certain\npurposes, such as treatment. Thus, using formal or automated methods for\nenforcing privacy policies requires a semantics of purpose requirements to\ndetermine whether an action is for a purpose or not. We provide such a\nsemantics using a formalism based on planning. We model planning using a\nmodified version of Markov Decision Processes, which exclude redundant actions\nfor a formal definition of redundant. We use the model to formalize when a\nsequence of actions is only for or not for a purpose. This semantics enables us\nto provide an algorithm for automating auditing, and to describe formally and\ncompare rigorously previous enforcement methods."

We have tested our implementations according to\nthe testsets given by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\nimplementation document. Some examples of the implementation tests are\npresented bellow."

    "summary": "Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different\ntypes of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, spams, and botnets. To reduce\nthe probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in traditional\nsecurity mechanisms like anti-virus and anti-spam software, sometimes also\nknown as self-defense mechanisms. However, such software does not completely\neliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk\nelimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In this regard, an\nimportant research problem is the analysis of optimal user self-defense\ninvestments and cyber-insurance contracts under the Internet environment. In\nthis paper, we investigate two problems and their relationship: 1) analyzing\noptimal self-defense investments in the Internet, under optimal cyber-insurance\ncoverage, where optimality is an insurer objective and 2) designing optimal\ncyber-insurance contracts for Internet users, where a contract is a (premium,\ncoverage) pair."

Unfortunately, in this paper we show that Li et\nal.'s scheme still has some security weaknesses in their design.

    "summary": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a popular means\nof causing mass targeted service disruptions, often for extended periods of\ntime. The relative ease and low costs of launching such attacks, supplemented\nby the current inadequate sate of any viable defense mechanism, have made them\none of the top threats to the Internet community today. Since the increasing\npopularity of web-based applications has led to several critical services being\nprovided over the Internet, it is imperative to monitor the network traffic so\nas to prevent malicious attackers from depleting the resources of the network\nand denying services to legitimate users. This paper first presents a brief\ndiscussion on some of the important types of DDoS attacks that currently exist\nand some existing mechanisms to combat these attacks. It then points out the\nmajor drawbacks of the currently existing defense mechanisms and proposes a new\nmechanism for protecting a web-server against a DDoS attack. In the proposed\nmechanism, incoming traffic to the server is continuously monitored and any\nabnormal rise in the inbound traffic is immediately detected. The detection\nalgorithm is based on a statistical analysis of the inbound traffic on the\nserver and a robust hypothesis testing framework. Simulations carried out on\nthe proposed mechanism have produced results that demonstrate effectiveness of\nthe proposed defense mechanism against DDoS attacks."

More over, there are many\nimage encryption schemes have been proposed, each one of them has its own\nstrength and weakness. This paper presents a new algorithm for the image\nencryption/decryption scheme. This paper is devoted to provide a secured image\nencryption technique using multiple chaotic based circular mapping. In this\npaper, first, a pair of sub keys is given by using chaotic logistic maps.\nSecond, the image is encrypted using logistic map sub key and in its\ntransformation leads to diffusion process. Third, sub keys are generated by\nfour different chaotic maps. Based on the initial conditions, each map may\nproduce various random numbers from various orbits of the maps. Among those\nrandom numbers, a particular number and from a particular orbit are selected as\na key for the encryption algorithm. Based on the key, a binary sequence is\ngenerated to control the encryption algorithm. The input image of 2-D is\ntransformed into a 1- D array by using two different scanning pattern (raster\nand Zigzag) and then divided into various sub blocks. Then the position\npermutation and value permutation is applied to each binary matrix based on\nmultiple chaos maps. Finally the receiver uses the same sub keys to decrypt the\nencrypted images. The salient features of the proposed image encryption method\nare loss-less, good peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Symmetric key\nencryption, less cross correlation, very large number of secret keys, and\nkey-dependent pixel value replacement."

    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and\nunique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor\nnodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost,\ninvisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and\nlimited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer\nattacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable\non WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel,\nuntrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and\nlimited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks;\nbut we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's\nconstraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs,\ndivide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them,\ninclude: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a\nwide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work\nenables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the\ngoal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this\npaper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms\nagainst the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to\nmanage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively."

    "summary": "This paper presents a new effective method for image encryption which employs\nmagnitude and phase manipulation using Differential Evolution (DE) approach.\nThe novelty of this work lies in deploying the concept of keyed discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) followed by DE operations for encryption purpose. To\nthis end, a secret key is shared between both encryption and decryption sides.\nFirstly two dimensional (2-D) keyed discrete Fourier transform is carried out\non the original image to be encrypted. Secondly crossover is performed between\ntwo components of the encrypted image, which are selected based on Linear\nFeedback Shift Register (LFSR) index generator. Similarly, keyed mutation is\nperformed on the real parts of a certain components selected based on LFSR\nindex generator. The LFSR index generator initializes it seed with the shared\nsecret key to ensure the security of the resulting indices. The process\nshuffles the positions of image pixels. A new image encryption scheme based on\nthe DE approach is developed which is composed with a simple diffusion\nmechanism. The deciphering process is an invertible process using the same key.\nThe resulting encrypted image is found to be fully distorted, resulting in\nincreasing the robustness of the proposed work. The simulation results validate\nthe proposed image encryption scheme."

    "summary": "Trojan virus attacks pose one of the most serious threats to computer\nsecurity. A Trojan horse is typically separated into two parts - a server and a\nclient. It is the client that is cleverly disguised as significant software and\npositioned in peer-to-peer file sharing networks, or unauthorized download\nwebsites. The most common means of infection is through email attachments. The\ndeveloper of the virus usually uses various spamming techniques in order to\ndistribute the virus to unsuspecting users. Malware developers use chat\nsoftware as another method to spread their Trojan horse viruses such as Yahoo\nMessenger and Skype. The objective of this paper is to explore the network\npacket information and detect the behavior of Trojan attacks to monitoring\noperating systems such as Windows and Linux. This is accomplished by detecting\nand analyzing the Trojan infected packet from a network segment -which passes\nthrough email attachment- before attacking a host computer. The results that\nhave been obtained to detect information and to store infected packets through\nmonitoring when using the web browser also compare the behaviors of Linux and\nWindows using the payload size after implementing the Wireshark sniffer packet\nresults. Conclusions of the figures analysis from the packet captured data to\nanalyze the control bit, and check the behavior of the control bits, and the\nusability of the operating systems Linux and Windows."

    "summary": "Recent Microsoft security bulletins show that kernel vulnerabilities are\nbecoming more and more important security threats. Despite the pretty extensive\nsecurity mitigations many of the kernel vulnerabilities are still exploitable.\nSuccessful kernel exploitation typically grants the attacker maximum privilege\nlevel and results in total machine compromise.\n  To protect against kernel exploitation, we have developed a tool which\nstatically rewrites the Microsoft Windows kernel as well as other kernel level\nmodules. Such rewritten binary files allow us to monitor control flow transfers\nduring operating system execution. At this point we are able to detect whether\nselected control transfer flow is valid or should be considered as an attack\nattempt. Our solution is especially directed towards preventing remote kernel\nexploitation attempts. Additionally, many of the local privilege escalation\nattacks are also blocked (also due to additional mitigation techniques we have\nimplemented). Our tool was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and\nWindows 7 (under both virtual and physical machines) on IA-32 compatible\nprocessors. Our apparatus is also completely standalone and does not require\nany third party software."

Different techniques and algorithms\nhave been already presented for Privacy Preserving data mining, which could be\nclassified in three common approaches: Data modification approach, Data\nsanitization approach and Secure Multi-party Computation approach. This paper\npresents a Data modification- based Framework for classification and evaluation\nof the privacy preserving data mining techniques. Based on our framework the\ntechniques are divided into two major groups, namely perturbation approach and\nanonymization approach. Also in proposed framework, eight functional criteria\nwill be used to analyze and analogically assessment of the techniques in these\ntwo major groups. The proposed framework provides a good basis for more\naccurate comparison of the given techniques to privacy preserving data mining.\nIn addition, this framework allows recognizing the overlapping amount for\ndifferent approaches and identifying modern approaches in this field."

This paper introduces a new cryptographic primitive,\nDouble Blind Comparisons, which allows two co-operating users, who each have an\nencrypted secret, to determine the equality or inequality of those two secrets,\neven though neither user can discover any information about what the secret is.\nThis paper also introduces a new problem in bilinear groups, conjectured to be\na hard problem. Assuming this conjecture, it is shown that neither user can\ndiscover any information about whether the secrets are equal, without the other\nuser's co-operation.

The operation \\boxdot, similarly to\nthe multiplication in IDEA [LM91, LMM91], bases on an algebraic group over\nw-bit words, so it is also capable of decrypting by means of the inverse\nelement of z in the group. The cipher utilizes a secret 4w-bit tweak -- an\neasily changeable parameter with unique value for each block encrypted under\nthe same key [LRW02] -- that is derived from the block index and an additional\n4w -bit key.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of detecting clones in wireless mobile adhoc\nnetworks. We assume that one of the devices of the network has been cloned.\nEverything, including certificates and secret keys. This can happen quite\neasily, because of a virus that immediately after sending all the content of\nthe infected device to the adversary destroys itself, or just because the owner\nhas left his device unattended for a few minutes in a hostile environment. The\nproblem is to detect this attack. We propose a solution in networks of mobile\ndevices carried by individuals. These networks are composed by nodes that have\nthe capability of using short-range communication technology like blue-tooth or\nWi-Fi, where nodes are carried by mobile users, and where links appear and\ndisappear according to the social relationships between the users. Our idea is\nto use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal\nsmart-phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the legitimate owner of the\ndevice and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks\nand Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol\nthat works very well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the\nnetwork that is part, or not very far, from the social community of the\noriginal device that has been cloned. Community Certificates work very well\nwhen the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen\ncredentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social\nnetwork from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an\nexcellent protection against this very strong attack. We prove our ideas and\nsolutions with extensive simulations in a real world scenario-with mobility\ntraces collected in a real life experiment"

    "summary": "Establishment of pairwise keys between sensor nodes in a sensor network is a\ndifficult problem due to resource limitations of sensor nodes as well as\nvulnerability to physical captures of sensor nodes by the enemy. Public-key\ncryptosystems are not much suited for most resource-constrained sensor\nnetworks. Recently, elliptic curve cryptographic techniques show that public\nkey cryptosystem is also feasible for resource-constrained sensor networks.\nHowever, most researchers accept that the symmetric key cryptosystems are\nviable options for resource-constrained sensor networks. In this paper, we\nfirst develop a basic principle to address the key pre-distribution problem in\nmobile sensor networks. Then, using this developed basic principle, we propose\na scheme which takes the advantage of the post-deployment knowledge. Our scheme\nis a modified version of the key prioritization technique proposed by Liu and\nNing. Our improved scheme provides reasonable network connectivity and\nsecurity. Moreover, the proposed scheme works for any deployment topology."

    "summary": "cryptographic hash function is a deterministic procedure that compresses an\narbitrary block of numerical data and returns a fixed-size bit string. There\nexist many hash functions: MD5, HAVAL, SHA, ... It was reported that these hash\nfunctions are not longer secure. Our work is focused in the construction of a\nnew hash function based on composition of functions. The construction used the\nNP-completeness of Three-dimensional contingency tables and the relaxation of\nthe constraint that a hash function should also be a compression function."

    "summary": "Spam messes up users inbox, consumes resources and spread attacks like DDoS,\nMiM, phishing etc. Phishing is a byproduct of email and causes financial loss\nto users and loss of reputation to financial institutions. In this paper we\nexamine the characteristics of phishing and technology used by Phishers. In\norder to counter anti-phishing technology, phishers change their mode of\noperation; therefore a continuous evaluation of phishing only helps us combat\nphisher effectiveness. In our study, we collected seven hundred thousand spam\nfrom a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to\nFebruary 2009. From the collected data, we identified different kinds of\nphishing scams and mode of operation. Our observation shows that phishers are\ndynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software\nvulnerabilities. We believe that this study will develop more efficient\nanti-phishing methodologies. Based on our analysis, we developed an\nanti-phishing methodology and implemented in our network. The results show that\nthis approach is highly effective to prevent phishing attacks. The proposed\napproach reduced more than 80% of the false negatives and more than 95% of\nphishing attacks in our network."

    "summary": "Traditionally, \"Cryptography\" is a benediction to information processing and\ncommunications, it helps people to store information securely and the private\ncommunications over long distances. Cryptovirology is the study of applications\nof cryptography to build the malicious software. It is an investigation, how\nmodern cryptographic tools and paradigms can be used to strengthen, develop and\nimprove new malicious software attacks. Cryptovirology attacks have been\ncategorized as : give malware enhanced privacy and be more robust against\nreverse-engineering, secondly give the attacker enhanced anonymity while\ncommunicating with deployed malware. This paper presents the idea of\n\"Cryptovirology\" which introduce a twist on how cryptography can also be used\noffensively. Being offensive means, it can be used to mount extortion based\nattacks that cause loss of access to information, loss of confidentiality, and\ninformation leakage, tasks which cryptography usually prevents. Also analyze\nthreats and attacks that misuse of cryptography can cause when combined with\nfraudulent software (viruses, Trojans). Public-key cryptography is very\nessential for the attacks that based on cryptovirology. This paper also suggest\nsome of the countermeasures, mechanisms to cope with and prevent such attacks.\nEven if the attackers actions on the host machine are being monitored, it still\ncannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is the attacker; and it\nis an \"originator-concealing attack\". Evidence should be collected from the\n\"author's own system which was used for the attack\". These attacks have\nimplications on how the use of cryptographic tools and techniques should be\naudited and managed in general purpose computing environments, and imply that\naccess to the cryptographic tools should be in well control of the system(such\nas API routines)."

    "summary": "The very nature of operations in peer-to-peer systems such as BitTorrent\nexposes information about participants to their peers. Nodes desiring\nanonymity, therefore, often chose to route their peer-to-peer traffic through\nanonymity relays, such as Tor. Unfortunately, these relays have little\nincentive for contribution and struggle to scale with the high loads that P2P\ntraffic foists upon them. We propose a novel modification for BitTorrent that\nwe call the BitTorrent Anonymity Marketplace. Peers in our system trade in k\nswarms obscuring the actual intent of the participants. But because peers can\ncross-trade torrents, the k-1 cover traffic can actually serve a useful\npurpose. This creates a system wherein a neighbor cannot determine if a node\nactually wants a given torrent, or if it is only using it as leverage to get\nthe one it really wants. In this paper, we present our design, explore its\noperation in simulation, and analyze its effectiveness. We demonstrate that the\nupload and download characteristics of cover traffic and desired torrents are\nstatistically difficult to distinguish."

Very\nrecently, Arshad et al. demonstrated that Tsai's scheme was vulnerable to\noffline password guessing attack and stolen-verifier attack. They also pointed\nthat Tsai's scheme did not provide known-key secrecy and perfect forward\nsecrecy. In order to overcome the weaknesses, Arshad et al. also proposed an\nimproved mutual authentication scheme based on elliptic curve discrete\nlogarithm problem for SIP and claimed that their scheme can withstand various\nattacks. In this paper, we do a cryptanalysis of Arshad et al.'s scheme and\nshow that Arshad et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to the password guessing attack."

    "summary": "In order to determine the user's trust is a growing concern for ensuring\nprivacy and security in a cloud computing environment. In cloud, user's data is\nstored in one or more remote server(s) which poses more security challenges for\nthe system. One of the most important concerns is to protect user's sensitive\ninformation from other users and hackers that may cause data leakage in cloud\nstorage. Having this security challenge in mind, this paper focuses on the\ndevelopment of a more secure cloud environment, to determine the trust of the\nservice requesting authorities by using a novel VM (Virtual Machine) monitoring\nsystem. Moreover, this research aims towards proposing a new trusted and\ncollaborative agent-based two-tier framework, titled WAY (Who Are You?), to\nprotect cloud resources. The framework can be used to provide security in\nnetwork, infrastructure, as well as data storage in a heterogeneous cloud\nplatform. If the trust updating policy is based on network activities, then the\nframework can provide network security. Similarly, it provides storage security\nby monitoring unauthorized access activities by the Cloud Service Users (CSU).\nInfrastructure security can be provided by monitoring the use of privileged\ninstructions within the isolated VMs. The uniqueness of the proposed security\nsolution lies in the fact that it ensures security and privacy both at the\nservice provider level as well as at the user level in a cloud environment."

Recent concerns about\ndeclassification polices have provided many choices for practical intended\ninformation release, but more precise enforcement mechanism for these policies\nis insufficiently studied. In this paper, we propose a security property on the\nwhere-dimension of declassification and present an enforcement based on\nautomated verification. The approach automatically transforms the abstract\nmodel with a variant of self-composition, and checks the reachability of\nillegal-flow state of the model after transformation. The self-composition is\nequipped with a store-match pattern to reduce the state space and to model the\nequivalence of declassified expressions in the premise of property. The\nevaluation shows that our approach is more precise than type-based enforcement."

Second, for $k=3,4$, the complete counting\nfunctions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences\nwith linear complexity $2^n$ are presented. Third, as a consequence of these\nresults, the counting functions for the number of $2^n$-periodic binary\nsequences with the $k$-error linear complexity for $k = 2$ and 3 are obtained.\nFurther more, an important result in a recent paper is proved to be not\ncompletely correct."

Designing efficient IDS for wireless ad-hoc networks that\nwould not affect the performance of the network significantly is indeed a\nchallenging task. Arguably, the most common thing in a review paper in the\ndomain of wireless networks is to compare the performances of different\nsolutions using simulation results. However, variance in multiple configuration\naspects including that due to different underlying routing protocols, makes the\ntask of simulation based comparative evaluation of IDS solutions somewhat\nunrealistic. In stead, the authors have followed an analytic approach to\nidentify the gaps in the existing IDS solutions for MANETs and wireless mesh\nnetworks.

Copyright\nviolation by means of unauthorized distribution, as well as unauthorized\ntampering of copyrighted audio data is an important technological and research\nissue. Audio watermarking has been proposed as a solution to tackle this issue.\nThe main purpose of audio watermarking is to protect against possible threats\nto the audio data and in case of copyright violation or unauthorized tampering,\nauthenticity of such data can be disputed by virtue of audio watermarking."

    "summary": "Authentication is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a datum\nor entity. This might involve confirming the identity of a person, tracing the\norigins of an artefact, ensuring that a product is what it's packaging and\nlabelling claims to be, or assuring that a computer program is a trusted one.\nThe authentication of information can pose special problems (especially\nman-in-the-middle attacks), and is often wrapped up with authenticating\nidentity. Literary can involve imitating the style of a famous author. If an\noriginal manuscript, typewritten text, or recording is available, then the\nmedium itself (or its packaging - anything from a box to e-mail headers) can\nhelp prove or disprove the authenticity of the document. The use of digital\nimages of handwritten historical documents has become more popular in recent\nyears. Volunteers around the world now read thousands of these images as part\nof their indexing process. Handwritten text images of old documents are\nsometimes difficult to read or noisy due to the preservation of the document\nand quality of the image [1]. Handwritten text offers challenges that are\nrarely encountered in machine-printed text. In addition, most problems faced in\nreading machine- printed text (e.g., character recognition, word segmentation,\nletter segmentation, etc.) are more severe, in handwritten text. In this paper\nwe Here in this paper we proposed a method for authenticating hand written text\nimages using back propagation algorithm.."

    "summary": "Integrating an efficient Error detection and correction scheme with less\nencoding and decoding complexity to support the distribution of keying material\nin a secure group communication is an important issue, since the amount of\ninformation carried out in the wireless channel is high which produces more\nerrors due to noise available in the communication channel. Moreover, the key\nmust be sent securely to the group members. In this paper, we propose a new\nefficient group key computation protocol that provides more security and also\nintegrates an encoding method in sender side and decoding method in the\nreceiver side. To achieve security in key computation process, we propose\nEuler's totient function based Diffie-hellman key distribution protocol. To\nprovide efficient error detection and correction method while distributing the\nKeying and re-keying information, we introduce tanner graph based encoding\nstopping set construction algorithm in sender and receiver side of the group\ncommunication. Two major operations in this scheme are joining and leaving\noperations for managing group memberships. The encoding and decoding complexity\nof this approach is computed in this paper and it is proved that this proposed\napproach takes less decoding time complexity."

The\nencryption standards such as DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced\nEncryption Standard) and EES (Escrowed Encryption Standard) are widely used to\nsolve the problem of communication over an insecure channel. With advanced\ntechnologies in computer hardware and software, these standards seem not to be\nas secure and fast as one would like. In this paper we propose a encryption\ntechnique which provides security to both the message and the secret key\nachieving confidentiality and authentication. The Symmetric algorithm used has\ntwo advantages over traditional schemes. First, the encryption and decryption\nprocedures are much simpler, and consequently, much faster. Second, the\nsecurity level is higher due to the inherent poly-alphabetic nature of the\nsubstitution mapping method used here, together with the translation and\ntransposition operations performed in the algorithm. Asymmetric algorithm RSA\nis worldwide known for its high security.

The IP\nSpoofing is considered to be one of the potentially brutal attack which acts as\na tool for the DDoS attack which is considered to be a major threat among\nsecurity problems in today's internet. These kinds of attack are extremely\nsevere. They bring down business of company drastically. DDoS attack can easily\nexhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short\nperiod of time. There are attacks exploiting some vulnerability or\nimplementation bug in the software implementation of a service to bring that\ndown and some attacks will use all the available resources at the target\nmachine. This deals on attacks that consume all the bandwidth available to the\nvictim machine. While concentrating on the bandwidth attack the TCP SYN flood\nis the more prominent attack. TCP/IP protocol suite is the most widely used\nprotocol suite for data communication. The TCP SYN flood works by exhausting\nthe TCP connection queue of the host and thus denying legitimate connection\nrequest. There are various methods used to detect and prevent this attack, one\nof which is to block the packet based on SYN flag count from the same IP\naddress. This kind of prevention methods becomes unsuitable when the attackers\nuse the Spoofed IP address. The SYN spoofing becomes a major tool the TCP SYN\nflooding. For the prevention of this kind of attacks, the TCP specific probing\nis used in the proposed scheme where the client is requested challenging number\nwhile sending the ACK in the three way hand shake. This is very useful to find\nthe Spoofed IP Packets/TCP SYN flood and preventing them."

    "summary": "Safeguarding online communications using public key cryptography is a\nwell-established practice today, but with the increasing reliance on\n`faceless', solely online entities one of the core aspects of public key\ncryptography is becoming a substantial problem in practice: Who can we trust to\nintroduce us to and vouch for some online party whose public key we see for the\nfirst time? Most existing certification models lack flexibility and have come\nunder attack repeatedly in recent years, and finding practical improvements has\na high priority.\n  We propose that the real-world concept of a notary or certifying witness can\nbe adapted to today's online environment quite easily, and that such a system\nwhen combined with peer-to-peer technologies for defense in depth is a viable\nalternative to monolithic trust infrastructures.\n  Instead of trusting assurances from a single party, integrity certifications\n(and data replication) can be provided among a group of independent parties in\na peer-to-peer fashion. As the likelihood of all such assurance providers being\nsubverted at the very same time is very much less than that of a single party,\noverall robustness is improved.\n  This paper presents the design and the implementation of our prototype online\nnotary system where independent computer notaries provide integrity\ncertification and highly-available replicated storage, and discusses how this\nonline notary system handles some common threat patterns."

As a result, users cannot circumvent malicious or\nvulnerable routers, thus making them susceptible to malicious router based\nattacks (e.g., correlation attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel social\nnetwork based trust model to help anonymity networks circumvent malicious\nrouters and obtain secure anonymity. In particular, we design an input\nindependent fuzzy model to determine trust relationships between friends based\non qualitative and quantitative social attributes, both of which can be readily\nobtained from existing social networks. Moreover, we design an algorithm for\npropagating trust over an anonymity network. We integrate these two elements in\nSTor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying\nthe Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the\neffectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have\ndemonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based\ncircuits in a distributed way. Although the design of STor is based on Tor\nnetwork, the social network based trust model can be adopted by other anonymity\nnetworks."

The\npaper hinges on the paradigm of multipath routing and exploits the properties\nof polynomials. The first step in the algorithm is to transform the data such\nthat it is impossible to obtain any information without possessing the entire\ntransformed data. The algorithm then uses an intuitively simple idea of a\njigsaw puzzle to break the transformed data into multiple packets where these\npackets form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these packets are sent along\ndisjoint paths to reach the receiver. A secure and efficient mechanism is\nprovided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original\ndata at the receiver-end from its fragments in the packets, that is, for\nsolving the jigsaw puzzle. The algorithm is designed to be secure so that no\nintermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication\ncode is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet."

This method is in response to the need to keep the data\nsecured and to protect the privacy of archived data on the servers, Cloud and\nPeer-to-Peer architectures. Due to the distributed nature of these\narchitectures, it is impossible to destroy the data completely. So, we store\nthe data by applying encryption and then manage the key, which is easier to do\nas the key is small and it can be hidden in the DHT (Distributed hash table).\nEven if the keys in the DHT and the encrypted data were compromised, the data\nwould still be secure. This paper describes existing solutions, points to their\nlimitations and suggests improvements with a new secure architecture. We\nevaluated and executed this architecture on the Java platform and proved that\nit is more secure than other architectures."

    "summary": "The design of authentication protocols, for online banking services in\nparticular and any service that is of sensitive nature in general, is quite\nchallenging. Indeed, enforcing security guarantees has overhead thus imposing\nadditional computation and design considerations that do not always meet\nusability and user requirements. On the other hand, relaxing assumptions and\nrigorous security design to improve the user experience can lead to security\nbreaches that can harm the users' trust in the system.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate how careful visualization design can enhance\nnot only the security but also the usability of the authentication process. To\nthat end, we propose a family of visualized authentication protocols, a\nvisualized transaction verification, and a \"decryptable to your eyes only\"\nprotocol. Through rigorous analysis, we verify that our protocols are immune to\nmany of the challenging authentication attacks applicable in the literature.\nFurthermore, using an extensive case study on a prototype of our protocols, we\nhighlight the potential of our approach for real-world deployment: we were able\nto achieve a high level of usability while satisfying stringent security\nrequirements."

Most of today's Internet users,\nespecially teenagers, publish various kinds of sensitive information, yet\nwithout recognizing that revealing this information might be detrimental to\ntheir future life and career. Unflattering images that can be openly accessed\nnow and in the future, e.g., by potential employers, constitute a particularly\nimportant such privacy concern. We have developed a novel, fast, and scalable\nsystem called X-pire! that allows users to set an expiration date for images in\nsocial networks (e.g., Facebook and Flickr) and on static websites, without\nrequiring any form of additional interaction with these web pages. Once the\nexpiration date is reached, the images become unavailable. Moreover, the\npublishing user can dynamically prolong or shorten the expiration dates of his\nimages later, and even enforce instantaneous expiration. Rendering the approach\npossible for social networks crucially required us to develop a novel technique\nfor embedding encrypted information within JPEG files in a way that survives\nJPEG compression, even for highly optimized implementations of JPEG\npost-processing with their various idiosyncrasies as commonly used in such\nnetworks.

In UPIR, the database knows which records have been retrieved, but does\nnot know the identity of the query issuer. The goal of UPIR is to disguise user\nprofiles from the database. Domingo-Ferrer et al.\\ focus on using a\npeer-to-peer community to construct a UPIR scheme, which we term P2P UPIR. In\nthis paper, we establish a strengthened model for P2P UPIR and clarify the\nprivacy goals of such schemes using standard terminology from the field of\nprivacy research. In particular, we argue that any solution providing privacy\nagainst the database should attempt to minimize any corresponding loss of\nprivacy against other users. We give an analysis of existing schemes, including\na new attack by the database. Finally, we introduce and analyze two new\nprotocols. Whereas previous work focuses on a special type of combinatorial\ndesign known as a configuration, our protocols make use of more general\ndesigns. This allows for flexibility in protocol set-up, allowing for a choice\nbetween having a dynamic scheme (in which users are permitted to enter and\nleave the system), or providing increased privacy against other users."

This paper\ninvestigates the hardness of precisely checking the quantitative information\nflow of a program according to such definitions. More precisely, we study the\n\"bounding problem\" of quantitative information flow, defined as follows: Given\na program M and a positive real number q, decide if the quantitative\ninformation flow of M is less than or equal to q. We prove that the bounding\nproblem is not a k-safety property for any k (even when q is fixed, for the\nShannon-entropy-based definition with the uniform distribution), and therefore\nis not amenable to the self-composition technique that has been successfully\napplied to checking non-interference. We also prove complexity theoretic\nhardness results for the case when the program is restricted to loop-free\nboolean programs. Specifically, we show that the problem is PP-hard for all\ndefinitions, showing a gap with non-interference which is coNP-complete for the\nsame class of programs.

In the era of Internet, its various services that\ninclude Web, e-mail, social networks, blogs, instant messaging, chats, etc. are\nused in terrorism not only for communication but also for i) creation of\nideology, ii) resource gathering, iii) recruitment, indoctrination and\ntraining, iv) creation of terror network, and v) information gathering. A major\nchallenge for law enforcement and intelligence agencies is efficient and\naccurate gathering of relevant and growing volume of crime data. This paper\nreports on use of established Na\\\"ive Bayesian filter for classification of\nthreat e-mails. Efficiency in filtering threat e-mail by use of three different\nNa\\\"ive Bayesian filter approaches i.e. single keywords, weighted multiple\nkeywords and weighted multiple keywords with keyword context matching are\nevaluated on a threat e-mail corpus created by extracting data from sources\nthat are very close to terrorism."

The algorithm is fairly simple: the attacker\ngenerates a polymorphic file that has two different types of content (text, as\na PDF document for example, and image: TIFF - two of the most widely used file\nformats). When the victim signs the dual content file, he/ she only sees a PDF\ndocument and is unaware of the hidden content inside the file. After obtaining\nthe legally signed document from the victim, the attacker simply has to change\nthe extension to the other file format. This will not invalidate the digital\nsignature, as no bits were altered. The destructive potential of the attack is\nconsiderable, as the Portable Document Format (PDF) is widely used in\ne-government and in e-business contexts."

These security issues are of great concern for this technology\nas it is being subjected to numerous attacks.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have\nemerged as an important solution to security threats surrounding the use of\npublic networks for private communications. While VPNs for wired line networks\nhave matured in both research and commercial environments, the design and\ndeployment of VPNs for WLAN is still an evolving field.

Namely, we focus on the secrecy and authenticity properties\nwhile keeping a high usability. In this sense, users are forced to blindly\ntrust the system administrators and developers. Moreover, as far as we know,\nthe use of formal methodologies for the verification of security properties of\ncommunication protocols isn't yet a common practice. We propose here a\nmethodology to fill this gap, i.e., to analyse both the security of the\nproposed protocol and the pertinence of the underlying premises. In this\nconcern, we propose the definition and formal evaluation of a protocol for the\ndistribution of digital identities. Once distributed, these identities can be\nused to verify integrity and source of information. We base our security\nanalysis on tools for automatic verification of security protocols widely\naccepted by the scientific community, and on the principles they are based\nupon. In addition, it is assumed perfect cryptographic primitives in order to\nfocus the analysis on the exchange of protocol messages. The main property of\nour protocol is the incorporation of tickets, created using digests of chaos\nbased nonces (numbers used only once) and users' personal data. Combined with a\nmultichannel authentication scheme with some previous knowledge, these tickets\nprovide security during the whole protocol by univocally linking each\nregistering user with a single request.

    "summary": "Pushback is a mechanism for defending against Distributed Denial-of-Service\n(DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but\nbecause most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the\nrouters. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially\ndrop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also\nnotified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to\nroute legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been\nadvocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In\norder to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the\nclient that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it\nis assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.\nIf the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it\nincreases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows\nthe traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before\nreaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback\nand puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback\ntechnique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS\nattacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed\nback to the core routers rather than having at the victim. The router based\nclient puzzle mechanism checks the host system whether it is legitimate or not\nby providing a puzzle to be solved by the suspected host."

To assure that network services will not be interrupted and\nmore effective defense mechanisms to protect against malicious traffic,\nespecially SYN floods. One problem in detecting SYN flood traffic is that\nserver nodes or firewalls cannot distinguish the SYN packets of normal TCP\nconnections from those of a SYN flood attack. Another problem is single-point\ndefenses (e.g. firewalls) lack the scalability needed to handle an increase in\nthe attack traffic. We have designed a new defense mechanism to detect the SYN\nflood attacks. First, we introduce a mechanism for detecting SYN flood traffic\nmore accurately by taking into consideration the time variation of arrival\ntraffic. We investigate the statistics regarding the arrival rates of both\nnormal TCP SYN packets and SYN flood attack packets. We then describe a new\ndetection mechanism based on these statistics.

    "summary": "In this paper it is shown that given a sufficient number of (noisy) random\nbinary linear equations, the Learning from Parity with Noise (LPN) problem can\nbe solved in essentially cube root time in the number of unknowns. The\ntechniques used to recover the solution are known from fast correlation attacks\non stream ciphers. As in fast correlation attacks, the performance of the\nalgorithm depends on the number of equations given. It is shown that if this\nnumber exceeds a certain bound, and the bias of the noisy equations is\npolynomial in number of unknowns, the running time of the algorithm is reduced\nto almost cube root time compared to the brute force checking of all possible\nsolutions. The mentioned bound is explicitly given and it is further shown that\nwhen this bound is exceeded, the complexity of the approach can even be further\nreduced."

We show that\nthis approach creates time-dependent correlations that enable an attack that\ncombines multiple watermarked flows. Such an attack can easily be mounted in\nnearly all applications of network flow watermarking, both in anonymous\ncommunication and stepping stone detection. The attack can be used to detect\nthe presence of a watermark, recover the secret parameters, and remove the\nwatermark from a flow. The attack can be effective even if different flows are\nmarked with different values of a watermark.\n  We analyze the efficacy of our attack using a probabilistic model and a\nMarkov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) model of interactive traffic. We also\nimplement our attack and test it using both synthetic and real-world traces,\nshowing that our attack is effective with as few as 10 watermarked flows.\nFinally, we propose possible countermeasures to defeat the multi-flow attack."

    "summary": "Recent research has made great strides in the field of detecting botnets.\nHowever, botnets of all kinds continue to plague the Internet, as many ISPs and\norganizations do not deploy these techniques. We aim to mitigate this state by\ncreating a very low-cost method of detecting infected bot host. Our approach is\nto leverage the botnet detection work carried out by some organizations to\neasily locate collaborating bots elsewhere. We created BotMosaic as a\ncountermeasure to IRC-based botnets. BotMosaic relies on captured bot instances\ncontrolled by a watermarker, who inserts a particular pattern into their\nnetwork traffic. This pattern can then be detected at a very low cost by client\norganizations and the watermark can be tuned to provide acceptable\nfalse-positive rates. A novel feature of the watermark is that it is inserted\ncollaboratively into the flows of multiple captured bots at once, in order to\nensure the signal is strong enough to be detected. BotMosaic can also be used\nto detect stepping stones and to help trace back to the botmaster. It is\ncontent agnostic and can operate on encrypted traffic. We evaluate BotMosaic\nusing simulations and a testbed deployment."

CensorSpoofer de-couples the upstream\nand downstream channels, using a low-bandwidth indirect channel for delivering\noutbound requests (URLs) and a high-bandwidth direct channel for downloading\nweb content. The upstream channel hides the request contents using\nsteganographic encoding within email or instant messages, whereas the\ndownstream channel uses IP address spoofing so that the real address of the\nproxies is not revealed either to legitimate users or censors. We built a\nproof-of-concept prototype that uses encrypted VoIP for this downstream channel\nand demonstrated the feasibility of using the CensorSpoofer framework in a\nrealistic environment."

    "summary": "Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring infrastructure-less\nnetworks comprised of mobile nodes that communicate over wireless links without\nany central control on a peer-to-peer basis. These individual nodes act as\nrouters to forward both their own data and also their neighbours' data by\nsending and receiving packets to and from other nodes in the network. The\nrelatively easy configuration and the quick deployment make ad hoc networks\nsuitable the emergency situations (such as human or natural disasters) and for\nmilitary units in enemy territory. Securing data dissemination between these\nnodes in such networks, however, is a very challenging task. Exposing such\ninformation to anyone else other than the intended nodes could cause a privacy\nand confidentiality breach, particularly in military scenarios. In this paper\nwe present a novel framework to enhance the privacy and data confidentiality in\nmobile ad hoc networks by attaching the originator policies to the messages as\nthey are sent between nodes. We evaluate our framework using the Network\nSimulator (NS-2) to check whether the privacy and confidentiality of the\noriginator are met. For this we implemented the Policy Enforcement Points\n(PEPs), as NS-2 agents that manage and enforce the policies attached to packets\nat every node in the MANET."

    "summary": "Linking network flows is an important problem in intrusion detection as well\nas anonymity. Passive traffic analysis can link flows but requires long periods\nof observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow\nwatermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow\nwatermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of\nusing a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the\nwatermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose\nthe first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that\nimproves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller\nthan previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on\nnetwork flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well\nas the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using\nhypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the\npassive approach we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis\nperform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however, the\nRAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the\ncase of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind\nwatermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have\nsimilar scalability constraints. We confirm our analysis by simulating the\ndetectors and testing them against large traces of real network flows."

These attacks can disrupt the availability of Internet services\ncompletely, by eating either computational or communication resources through\nsheer volume of packets sent from distributed locations in a coordinated manner\nor graceful degradation of network performance by sending attack traffic at low\nrate. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that deals with the\ndetection of variety of DDoS attacks by monitoring propagation of abrupt\ntraffic changes inside ISP Domain and then characterizes flows that carry\nattack traffic. Two statistical metrics namely, Volume and Flow are used as\nparameters to detect DDoS attacks. Effectiveness of an anomaly based detection\nand characterization system highly depends on accuracy of threshold value\nsettings. Inaccurate threshold values cause a large number of false positives\nand negatives. Therefore, in our scheme, Six-Sigma and varying tolerance factor\nmethods are used to identify threshold values accurately and dynamically for\nvarious statistical metrics. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used\nas simulation testbed to validate effectiveness of proposed approach.

    "summary": "In medical organizations large amount of personal data are collected and\nanalyzed by the data miner or researcher, for further perusal. However, the\ndata collected may contain sensitive information such as specific disease of a\npatient and should be kept confidential. Hence, the analysis of such data must\nensure due checks that ensure protection against threats to the individual\nprivacy. In this context, greater emphasis has now been given to the privacy\npreservation algorithms in data mining research. One of the approaches is\nanonymization approach that is able to protect private information; however,\nvaluable information can be lost. Therefore, the main challenge is how to\nminimize the information loss during an anonymization process. The proposed\nmethod is grouping similar data together based on sensitive attribute and then\nanonymizes them. Our experimental results show the proposed method offers\nbetter outcomes with respect to information loss and execution time."

    "summary": "Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a very popular access control model, for\nlong time investigated and widely deployed in the security architecture of\ndifferent enterprises. To implement RBAC, roles have to be firstly identified\nwithin the considered organization. Usually the process of (automatically)\ndefining the roles in a bottom up way, starting from the permissions assigned\nto each user, is called {\\it role mining}. In literature, the role mining\nproblem has been formally analyzed and several techniques have been proposed in\norder to obtain a set of valid roles.\n  Recently, the problem of defining different kind of constraints on the number\nand the size of the roles included in the resulting role set has been\naddressed. In this paper we provide a formal definition of the role mining\nproblem under the cardinality constraint, i.e. restricting the maximum number\nof permissions that can be included in a role. We discuss formally the\ncomputational complexity of the problem and propose a novel heuristic.\nFurthermore we present experimental results obtained after the application of\nthe proposed heuristic on both real and synthetic datasets, and compare the\nresulting performance to previous proposals"

Our work is the first formal analysis to consider\nmessages that are sent in the core network, where we take into account details\nof the carrying protocol (i.e., MAP or Diameter) and of the mechanism for\nsecure transport (i.e., MAPsec/TCAPsec or IPsec ESP). Moreover, we report on a\ndeficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the\nspecifications of the core network security (called network domain security),\nwhich may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker\nnot only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the\nprotocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA\nrun over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward\napplication of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and\nLTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently\nlong session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication\nproperties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used\nprimitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions."

We find the conditions for a unique optimal solution to exist for that\nproblem as that maximizing the customer's surplus. We also show that the\noptimal amount of personal information is influenced most by the immediate\nbenefits the customer gets, i.e., the price and the quantity of service offered\nby the service provider, rather than by maximum loss it may incur. Easy\nspenders take larger risks with respect to low-spenders, but an increase in\nprice drives customers towards a more careful risk-taking attitude anyway. A\nmajor role is also played by the privacy level, which the service provider\nemploys to regulate the benefits released to the customers. We also provide a\nclosed form solution for the limit case of a perfectly secure provider, showing\nthat the results do not differ significantly from those obtained in the general\ncase. The trade-off analysis may be employed by the customer to determine its\nlevel of exposure in the relationship with its service provider."

While in human-life, trust usually has some kind of commonly\nunderstood meaning, in the realm of computing and communications systems, it\ncould be interpreted differently in different environments and settings. On the\nother hand, security is about making sure that the participating entities are\nlegitimate in a communication event or incident so that the core requirements\nof privacy, integrity, and authenticity are maintained. This notion is also\ntrue for our human life, even for example entering a house needs legitimacy of\na person. Some boundary lines preserve the security; otherwise an unwanted\naccess is called a 'security breach'. The intent of this article is to compare\nand discuss these two terms with our societal behavior and understanding\namongst entities. To illustrate these issues especially in computing and\ncommunications world, some of the innovating and recent technologies are\ndiscussed which demand trust and security within their core operational\nstructures. Alongside presenting generally established ideas, some critical\npoints are mentioned that may be sometimes debatable within the research\ncommunity."

    "summary": "Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is very\nvital because the security protocols therein, should be devised to work at the\nlink layer. Theoretically, any link layer security protocol must support three\nvital security attributes viz. Confidentiality, Message Integrity and Replay\nprotection. However, in order to ensure lesser overhead, replay protection is\noften not incorporated as part of the link layer security framework. We argue\nhere, that it is essential to implement replay protection at the link layer\nonly and devise a simple scheme to do so. We first survey the common approaches\nto ensuring replay protection in conventional networks. We also implement the\nconventional algorithms for replay protection using the link layer framework\nfor WSNs viz. TinySec as the underlying platform. Subsequently analyzing their\nlimitations, we propose a novel Bloom-filter based replay protection algorithm\nfor unicast communications. We show that our algorithm is better than the other\ncontemporary approaches for ensuring replay protection in unicast\ncommunications in the WSNs."

    "summary": "Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) indeed is\ncritical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well\nas due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes\nand degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation\nsensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on\nlow-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop\ncommunication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at\nthe link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of\nbeing at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an\nenergy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists\na number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of\nthe security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we\nshow in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands\nof the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for\ninvestigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer\nsecurity architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with\nrespect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and\nexperiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security\narchitecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related\nto our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes\nof operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection. The\narchitecture proposed is aimed to offer the optimal level of security at the\nminimal overhead, thus saving the precious resources in the WSNs."

    "summary": "The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of resource starved sensor\nnodes that are deployed to sense, process and communicate vital information to\nthe base station. Due to the stringent constraints on the resources in the\nsensor nodes on one hand and due to the communications costs being always\nsignificantly higher than the data processing costs, the WSNs typically, employ\nin-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of\npackets eventually transmitted to the base station. Such innetwork processing\nlargely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a\ncompact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous\n& pervasive deployment, heavier resource demands of the security protocols and\ndue to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns\nin WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions\nwhen using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes\ndepends on that of various other nodes. Hence, the protocols for data\naggregation have to carefully devised with a constant vigil on ensuring\nsecurity of the data. In this paper, based on our survey of the existing\nresearch efforts for ensuring secure data aggregation, we propose a novel\napproach using homomorphic encryption and additive digital signatures to\nachieve confidentiality, integrity and availability for secure data aggregation\nin wireless sensor networks."

    "summary": "To date, most work regarding the formal analysis of access control schemes\nhas focused on quantifying and comparing the expressive power of a set of\nschemes. Although expressive power is important, it is a property that exists\nin an absolute sense, detached from the application-specific context within\nwhich an access control scheme will ultimately be deployed. In this paper, by\ncontrast, we formalize the access control suitability analysis problem, which\nseeks to evaluate the degree to which a set of candidate access control schemes\ncan meet the needs of an application-specific workload. This process involves\nboth reductions to assess whether a scheme is capable of implementing a\nworkload, as well as cost analysis using ordered measures to quantify the\noverheads of using each candidate scheme to service the workload. We develop a\nmathematical framework for analyzing instances of the suitability analysis\nproblem, and evaluate this framework both formally (by quantifying its\nefficiency and accuracy properties) and practically (by exploring a group-based\nmessaging workload from the literature). An ancillary contribution of our work\nis the identification of auxiliary machines, which are a useful class of\nmodifications that can be made to enhance the expressive power of an access\ncontrol scheme without negatively impacting the safety properties of the\nscheme."

The five\nvulnerabilities we study in this paper are: (1) Resource Injection, (2) Path\nManipulation, (3) System Information Leak, (4) Denial of Service and (5)\nUnreleased Resource vulnerabilities. We analyze the reason why each of these\nvulnerabilities occur in the file reader server socket program, discuss the\nimpact of leaving them unattended in the program, and propose solutions to\nremove each of these vulnerabilities from the program. We also analyze any\npotential performance tradeoffs (such as increase in code size and loss of\nfeatures) that could arise while incorporating the proposed solutions on the\nserver program. The proposed solutions are very generic in nature, and can be\nsuitably modified to correct any such vulnerabilities in software developed in\nany other programming language.

    "summary": "Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure is a major\nconcern of every organization. As an organizations employees need to access\nsuch information in order to carry out their daily work, data leakage detection\nis both an essential and challenging task. Whether caused by malicious intent\nor an inadvertent mistake, data loss can result in significant damage to the\norganization. Fingerprinting is a content-based method used for detecting data\nleakage. In fingerprinting, signatures of known confidential content are\nextracted and matched with outgoing content in order to detect leakage of\nsensitive content. Existing fingerprinting methods, however, suffer from two\nmajor limitations. First, fingerprinting can be bypassed by rephrasing (or\nminor modification) of the confidential content, and second, usually the whole\ncontent of document is fingerprinted (including non-confidential parts),\nresulting in false alarms. In this paper we propose an extension to the\nfingerprinting approach that is based on sorted k-skip-n-grams. The proposed\nmethod is able to produce a fingerprint of the core confidential content which\nignores non-relevant (non-confidential) sections. In addition, the proposed\nfingerprint method is more robust to rephrasing and can also be used to detect\na previously unseen confidential document and therefore provide better\ndetection of intentional leakage incidents."

The second approach hides a message in a wordlist where\nASCII value of embedded character determines length and starting letter of a\nword. The third approach conceals a message, without degrading cover, by using\nstart and end letter of words of the cover. For enhancing the security of\nsecret message, the message is scrambled using one-time pad scheme before being\nconcealed and cipher text is then concealed in cover.

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a lightweight permission enforcement approach -\nTap-Wave-Rub (TWR) - for smartphone malware prevention. TWR is based on simple\nhuman gestures that are very quick and intuitive but less likely to be\nexhibited in users' daily activities. Presence or absence of such gestures,\nprior to accessing an application, can effectively inform the OS whether the\naccess request is benign or malicious. Specifically, we present the design of\ntwo mechanisms: (1) accelerometer based phone tapping detection; and (2)\nproximity sensor based finger tapping, rubbing or hand waving detection. The\nfirst mechanism is geared for NFC applications, which usually require the user\nto tap her phone with another device. The second mechanism involves very simple\ngestures, i.e., tapping or rubbing a finger near the top of phone's screen or\nwaving a hand close to the phone, and broadly appeals to many applications\n(e.g., SMS). In addition, we present the TWR-enhanced Android permission model,\nthe prototypes implementing the underlying gesture recognition mechanisms, and\na variety of novel experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. Our results\nsuggest the proposed approach could be very effective for malware detection and\nprevention, with quite low false positives and false negatives, while imposing\nlittle to no additional burden on the users."

    "summary": "We introduce quantitative usability and security models to guide the design\nof password management schemes --- systematic strategies to help users create\nand remember multiple passwords. In the same way that security proofs in\ncryptography are based on complexity-theoretic assumptions (e.g., hardness of\nfactoring and discrete logarithm), we quantify usability by introducing\nusability assumptions. In particular, password management relies on assumptions\nabout human memory, e.g., that a user who follows a particular rehearsal\nschedule will successfully maintain the corresponding memory. These assumptions\nare informed by research in cognitive science and validated through empirical\nstudies. Given rehearsal requirements and a user's visitation schedule for each\naccount, we use the total number of extra rehearsals that the user would have\nto do to remember all of his passwords as a measure of the usability of the\npassword scheme. Our usability model leads us to a key observation: password\nreuse benefits users not only by reducing the number of passwords that the user\nhas to memorize, but more importantly by increasing the natural rehearsal rate\nfor each password. We also present a security model which accounts for the\ncomplexity of password management with multiple accounts and associated\nthreats, including online, offline, and plaintext password leak attacks.\nObserving that current password management schemes are either insecure or\nunusable, we present Shared Cues--- a new scheme in which the underlying secret\nis strategically shared across accounts to ensure that most rehearsal\nrequirements are satisfied naturally while simultaneously providing strong\nsecurity. The construction uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to achieve these\ncompeting goals."

Since the rising attractiveness of\nweb-based applications has led to quite a lot of significant services being\nprovided more than the Internet, it is very important to monitor the network\ntransfer so as to stop hateful attackers from depleting the assets of the\nnetwork and denying services to rightful users. The most important drawbacks of\nthe presently existing defense mechanisms and propose a new-fangled mechanism\nfor defending a web-server against a DDoS attack. In the proposed mechanism,\nincoming traffic to the server is always monitored and some irregular rise in\nthe inbound traffic is without delay detected. The detection algorithm is based\non a statistical analysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust\nsuggestion testing structure. While the detection procedure is on, the sessions\nfrom the rightful sources are not disrupted and the load on the server is\nrestored to the usual level by overcrowding the traffic from the attacking\nsources. The accurate modules employ multifaceted detection logic and hence\ninvolve additional overhead for their execution. On the other hand, they have\nvery huge detection accuracy. Simulations approved on the proposed mechanism\nhave produced results that show efficiency of the proposed defense mechanism\nagainst DDoS attacks."

    "summary": "In this work, we study information leakage in timing side channels that arise\nin the context of shared event schedulers. Consider two processes, one of them\nan innocuous process (referred to as Alice) and the other a malicious one\n(referred to as Bob), using a common scheduler to process their jobs. Based on\nwhen his jobs get processed, Bob wishes to learn about the pattern (size and\ntiming) of jobs of Alice. Depending on the context, knowledge of this pattern\ncould have serious implications on Alice's privacy and security. For instance,\nshared routers can reveal traffic patterns, shared memory access can reveal\ncloud usage patterns, and suchlike. We present a formal framework to study the\ninformation leakage in shared resource schedulers using the pattern estimation\nerror as a performance metric. The first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling\npolicy and time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) are identified as two extreme\npolicies on the privacy metric, FCFS has the least, and TDMA has the highest.\nHowever, on performance based metrics, such as throughput and delay, it is well\nknown that FCFS significantly outperforms TDMA. We then derive two parametrized\npolicies, accumulate and serve, and proportional TDMA, which take two different\napproaches to offer a tunable trade-off between privacy and performance."

Unfortunately, they also become fertile grounds for hackers to\ndeploy malware and to spread virus. There is an urgent need to have a \"security\nanalytic & forensic system\" which can facilitate analysts to examine, dissect,\nassociate and correlate large number of mobile applications. An effective\nanalytic system needs to address the following questions: How to automatically\ncollect and manage a high volume of mobile malware? How to analyze a zero-day\nsuspicious application, and compare or associate it with existing malware\nfamilies in the database? How to perform information retrieval so to reveal\nsimilar malicious logic with existing malware, and to quickly identify the new\nmalicious code segment? In this paper, we present the design and implementation\nof DroidAnalytics, a signature based analytic system to automatically collect,\nmanage, analyze and extract android malware. The system facilitates analysts to\nretrieve, associate and reveal malicious logics at the \"opcode level\". We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of DroidAnalytics using 150,368 Android applications,\nand successfully determine 2,494 Android malware from 102 different families,\nwith 342 of them being zero-day malware samples from six different families. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in showing such a\nlarge Android malware analysis/detection.

The linguistic variables are defined for both T and P and then these\nvariables are implemented in our laboratory to verify the proposed trust model.\nWe represent the trustworthiness of test system for two cases of evidence value\nusing Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM).

Security is an important issue for cloud computing, both\nin terms of legal compliance and user trust, and needs to be considered at\nevery phase of design. In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT\nservices are under proper physical, logical and personnel controls, Cloud\nComputing moves the application software and databases to the large data\ncenters, where the management of the data and services may not be trustworthy.\nThis unique attribute, however, poses many new security challenges.

    "summary": "Information theoretic secrecy is combined with cryptographic secrecy to\ncreate a secret-key exchange protocol for wireless networks. A network of\ntransmitters, which already have cryptographically secured channels between\nthem, cooperate to exchange a secret key with a new receiver at a random\nlocation, in the presence of passive eavesdroppers at unknown locations. Two\nspatial point processes: homogeneous Poisson process and independent uniformly\ndistributed points are used for the spatial distributions of transmitters and\neavesdroppers. We analyse the impact of the number of cooperating transmitters\nand the number of eavesdroppers on the area fraction where secure communication\nis possible. Upper bounds on the probability of existence of positive secrecy\nbetween the cooperating transmitters and the receiver are derived. The\ncloseness of the upper bounds to the real value is then estimated by means of\nnumerical simulations. Simulations also indicate that a deterministic spatial\ndistribution for the transmitters e.g. hexagonal and square lattices, increases\nthe probability of existence of positive secrecy capacity compared to the\nrandom spatial distributions. For the same number of friendly nodes,\ncooperative transmitting provides a dramatically larger secrecy region than\ncooperative jamming and cooperative relaying."

    "summary": "The numbers of the botnet attacks are increasing day by day and the detection\nof botnet spreading in the network has become very challenging. Bots are having\nspecific characteristics in comparison of normal malware as they are controlled\nby the remote master server and usually dont show their behavior like normal\nmalware until they dont receive any command from their master server. Most of\ntime bot malware are inactive, hence it is very difficult to detect. Further\nthe detection or tracking of the network of theses bots requires an\ninfrastructure that should be able to collect the data from a diverse range of\ndata sources and correlate the data to bring the bigger picture in view. In\nthis paper, we are sharing our experience of botnet detection in the private\nnetwork as well as in public zone by deploying the nepenthes honeypots. The\nautomated framework for malware collection using nepenthes and analysis using\nanti-virus scan are discussed. The experimental results of botnet detection by\nenabling nepenthes honeypots in network are shown. Also we saw that existing\nknown bots in our network can be detected."

In this paper, we explore the use of KASs in\nentity authentication protocols, where we use derived keys to encrypt\nchallenges. This novel use of KASs permits the efficient authentication of an\nentity in accordance with an authentication policy by associating entities with\nsecurity labels representing specific services. Cryptographic keys are\nassociated with each security label and demonstrating knowledge of an\nappropriate key is used as the basis for authentication. Thus, by controlling\nthe distribution of such keys, restrictions may be efficiently placed upon the\ncircumstances under which an entity may be authenticated and the services to\nwhich they may gain access.\n  In this work, we explore how both standardized protocols and novel\nconstructions may be developed to authenticate entities as members of a group\nassociated to a particular security label, whilst protecting the long-term\nsecrets in the system. We also see that such constructions may allow for\nauthentication whilst preserving anonymity, and that by including a trusted\nthird party we can achieve the authentication of individual identities and\nauthentication based on timestamps without the need for synchronized clocks."

    "summary": "Malware family classification is an age old problem that many Anti-Virus (AV)\ncompanies have tackled. There are two common techniques used for\nclassification, signature based and behavior based. Signature based\nclassification uses a common sequence of bytes that appears in the binary code\nto identify and detect a family of malware. Behavior based classification uses\nartifacts created by malware during execution for identification. In this paper\nwe report on a unique dataset we obtained from our operations and classified\nusing several machine learning techniques using the behavior-based approach.\nOur main class of malware we are interested in classifying is the popular Zeus\nmalware. For its classification we identify 65 features that are unique and\nrobust for identifying malware families. We show that artifacts like file\nsystem, registry, and network features can be used to identify distinct malware\nfamilies with high accuracy---in some cases as high as 95%."

    "summary": "Cloud computing is a term coined to a network that offers incredible\nprocessing power, a wide array of storage space and unbelievable speed of\ncomputation. Social media channels, corporate structures and individual\nconsumers are all switching to the magnificent world of cloud computing. The\nflip side to this coin is that with cloud storage emerges the security issues\nof confidentiality, data integrity and data availability. Since the cloud is a\nmere collection of tangible super computers spread across the world,\nauthentication and authorization for data access is more than a necessity. Our\nwork attempts to overcome these security threats. The proposed methodology\nsuggests the encryption of the files to be uploaded on the cloud. The integrity\nand confidentiality of the data uploaded by the user is ensured doubly by not\nonly encrypting it but also providing access to the data only on successful\nauthentication."

This has made it possible to manage and run businesses without\neven setting up an IT infrastructure. It offers multi-fold benefits to the\nusers moving to a cloud, while posing unknown security and privacy issues. User\nauthentication is one such growing concern and is greatly needed in order to\nensure privacy and security in a cloud computing environment. This paper\ndiscusses the security at different levels viz. network, application and\nvirtualization, in a cloud computing environment. A security framework based on\none-time pass key mechanism has been proposed. The uniqueness of the proposed\nsecurity protocol lies in the fact, that it provides security to both the\nservice providers as well the users in a highly conflicting cloud environment."

    "summary": "Virtual Trusted Platform modules (TPMs) were proposed as a software-based\nalternative to the hardware-based TPMs to allow the use of their cryptographic\nfunctionalities in scenarios where multiple TPMs are required in a single\nplatform, such as in virtualized environments. However, virtualizing TPMs,\nespecially virutalizing the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), strikes\nagainst one of the core principles of Trusted Computing, namely the need for a\nhardware-based root of trust. In this paper we show how strength of\nhardware-based security can be gained in virtual PCRs by binding them to their\ncorresponding hardware PCRs. We propose two approaches for such a binding. For\nthis purpose, the first variant uses binary hash trees, whereas the other\nvariant uses incremental hashing. In addition, we present an FPGA-based\nimplementation of both variants and evaluate their performance."

For\neach requirement, there is a collection of rules that transform a set of\nprotocol steps violating the requirement into a set conforming it.

Two approaches have been derived for it i.e.\nSignature Based Detection and Heuristic Based Detection. These approaches\nperformed well against known malicious programs but cannot catch the new\nmalicious programs. Different researchers have proposed methods using data\nmining and machine learning for detecting new malicious programs.

This work presents a static malware detection system using\ndata mining techniques such as Information Gain, Principal component analysis,\nand three classifiers: SVM, J48, and Na\\\"ive Bayes. For overcoming the lack of\nusual anti-virus products, we use methods of static analysis to extract\nvaluable features of Windows PE file. We extract raw features of Windows\nexecutables which are PE header information, DLLs, and API functions inside\neach DLL of Windows PE file. Thereafter, Information Gain, calling frequencies\nof the raw features are calculated to select valuable subset features, and then\nPrincipal Component Analysis is used for dimensionality reduction of the\nselected features.

Now a days, most of the web browsers offer auto\nlogin feature for the favorite web sites such as yahoo, google, gmail etc.\nusing these credential information. This facilitates the misuse of user\ncredentials. Privatizing user credential information of web services in a\nshared user environment provides a feature enhancement where the root user will\nbe able to privatize his stored credentials by enforcing some masking\ntechniques such that even a user logs on to the system with root user\ncredentials, he will not be able to access privatized data. In case of web\nbrowsers auto login feature, a root user can disable the feature manually by\ndeleting entries from web browsers' saved password list. But this involves\nspending a considerable amount of time and the biggest problem is that he has\nto insert those credentials once again when he next visits these websites. This\napplication resumes auto login feature whenever root user disable the masked\nmode. The application includes two parts: Masked Application Mode and Disabling\nthe Masked Application Mode. When the system goes for masked application mode,\nthe other user will not be able to use the credentials of the root user.If the\nother user tries to access any of the web pages which have been masked, the\nother user will have to authenticate with his own credentials. Disabling the\nmasked mode requires authentication from the root user. As long as this\ncredential is not shared, masked mode can be disabled only by the root user."

    "summary": "Data outsourcing is a growing business model offering services to individuals\nand enterprises for processing and storing a huge amount of data. It is not\nonly economical but also promises higher availability, scalability, and more\neffective quality of service than in-house solutions. Despite all its benefits,\ndata outsourcing raises serious security concerns for preserving data\nconfidentiality. There are solutions for preserving confidentiality of data\nwhile supporting search on the data stored in outsourced environments. However,\nsuch solutions do not support access policies to regulate access to a\nparticular subset of the stored data.\n  For complex user management, large enterprises employ Role-Based Access\nControls (RBAC) models for making access decisions based on the role in which a\nuser is active in. However, RBAC models cannot be deployed in outsourced\nenvironments as they rely on trusted infrastructure in order to regulate access\nto the data. The deployment of RBAC models may reveal private information about\nsensitive data they aim to protect. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap\nby proposing \\textbf{$\\mathit{ESPOON_{ERBAC}}$} for enforcing RBAC policies in\noutsourced environments. $\\mathit{ESPOON_{ERBAC}}$ enforces RBAC policies in an\nencrypted manner where a curious service provider may learn a very limited\ninformation about RBAC policies.

The main advantage of the new protocol is that it achieves the\nunique and desirable property of being able to restore security for future\nprotocol executions without the need to replace any decoder in the event that\nall system components other than the content decryption chips have been\ncompromised. By comparison, existing protocols necessitate the replacement of\nthe entire decoder population in this scenario."

After\nframing out the product, it is been subscribed to their individual customers.\nOnce a customer subscribed the product, then he will be raising a request to\nthe client (BT) for updating any policy or component in the product. The\ncustomer has been given read/write access to the subscribed product. The\ncustomer user having read/write access is only allowed to raise a request for\nthe product, but not the user having only the read access. The group of request\nis been managed as manage work queue in client area. Management of this\nprotocol inside the product is considering as Security Protocol Review Method\nAnalyzer. SPRMAN helps BT to overcome all the hurdles faced by them while\nprocessing the requests of their various clients using their already existing\nsoftware applications. SPRMAN emphasizes on nature of the request and gives\npriority to issues based on their degree of future consequences. Thus SPRMAN\nbuilds a good relationship between BT and its customers."

    "summary": "Third-party analysis on private records is becoming increasingly important\ndue to the widespread data collection for various analysis purposes. However,\nthe data in its original form often contains sensitive information about\nindividuals, and its publication will severely breach their privacy. In this\npaper, we present a novel Privacy-preserving Data Analytics framework PDA,\nwhich allows a third-party aggregator to obliviously conduct many different\ntypes of polynomial-based analysis on private data records provided by a\ndynamic sub-group of users. Notably, every user needs to keep only O(n) keys to\njoin data analysis among O(2^n) different groups of users, and any data\nanalysis that is represented by polynomials is supported by our framework.\nBesides, a real implementation shows the performance of our framework is\ncomparable to the peer works who present ad-hoc solutions for specific data\nanalysis applications. Despite such nice properties of PDA, it is provably\nsecure against a very powerful attacker (chosen-plaintext attack) even in the\nDolev-Yao network model where all communication channels are insecure."

    "summary": "We study how to enable auctions in the big data context to solve many\nupcoming data-based decision problems in the near future. We consider the\ncharacteristics of the big data including, but not limited to, velocity,\nvolume, variety, and veracity, and we believe any auction mechanism design in\nthe future should take the following factors into consideration: 1) generality\n(variety); 2) efficiency and scalability (velocity and volume); 3) truthfulness\nand verifiability (veracity). In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving\nconstruction for auction mechanism design in the big data, which prevents\nadversaries from learning unnecessary information except those implied in the\nvalid output of the auction. More specifically, we considered one of the most\ngeneral form of the auction (to deal with the variety), and greatly improved\nthe the efficiency and scalability by approximating the NP-hard problems and\navoiding the design based on garbled circuits (to deal with velocity and\nvolume), and finally prevented stakeholders from lying to each other for their\nown benefit (to deal with the veracity). We achieve these by introducing a\nnovel privacy-preserving winner determination algorithm and a novel payment\nmechanism. Additionally, we further employ a blind signature scheme as a\nbuilding block to let bidders verify the authenticity of their payment reported\nby the auctioneer. The comparison with peer work shows that we improve the\nasymptotic performance of peer works' overhead from the exponential growth to a\nlinear growth and from linear growth to a logarithmic growth, which greatly\nimproves the scalability."

    "summary": "Tor hidden services allow running Internet services while protecting the\nlocation of the servers. Their main purpose is to enable freedom of speech even\nin situations in which powerful adversaries try to suppress it. However,\nproviding location privacy and client anonymity also makes Tor hidden services\nan attractive platform for every kind of imaginable shady service. The ease\nwith which Tor hidden services can be set up has spurred a huge growth of\nanonymously provided Internet services of both types. In this paper we analyse\nthe landscape of Tor hidden services. We have studied Tor hidden services after\ncollecting 39824 hidden service descriptors on 4th of Feb 2013 by exploiting\nprotocol and implementation flaws in Tor: we scanned them for open ports; in\nthe case of HTTP services, we analysed and classified their content. We also\nestimated the popularity of hidden services by looking at the request rate for\nhidden service descriptors by clients. We found that while the content of Tor\nhidden services is rather varied, the most popular hidden services are related\nto botnets."

In this paper, we present three major\napproaches to non-signature-based network detection: PCA-based, sketch-based,\nand signal-analysis-based. In addition, we introduce a framework that subsumes\nthe three approaches and a scheme for network anomaly extraction. We believe\nnetwork anomaly detection will become more important in the future because of\nthe increasing importance of network security."

    "summary": "It is generally recognized that the traffic generated by an individual\nconnected to a network acts as his biometric signature. Several tools exploit\nthis fact to fingerprint and monitor users. Often, though, these tools assume\nto access the entire traffic, including IP addresses and payloads. This is not\nfeasible on the grounds that both performance and privacy would be negatively\naffected. In reality, most ISPs convert user traffic into NetFlow records for a\nconcise representation that does not include, for instance, any payloads. More\nimportantly, large and distributed networks are usually NAT'd, thus a few IP\naddresses may be associated to thousands of users. We devised a new\nfingerprinting framework that overcomes these hurdles. Our system is able to\nanalyze a huge amount of network traffic represented as NetFlows, with the\nintent to track people. It does so by accurately inferring when users are\nconnected to the network and which IP addresses they are using, even though\nthousands of users are hidden behind NAT. Our prototype implementation was\ndeployed and tested within an existing large metropolitan WiFi network serving\nabout 200,000 users, with an average load of more than 1,000 users\nsimultaneously connected behind 2 NAT'd IP addresses only. Our solution turned\nout to be very effective, with an accuracy greater than 90%. We also devised\nnew tools and refined existing ones that may be applied to other contexts\nrelated to NetFlow analysis."

For instance, such\nknowledge is necessary and sufficient to perform data mining tasks such as\nnearest neighbour searches or clustering. However, when inter-record distances\nare published in addition to the microdata for research purposes, the risk of\nidentity disclosure has to be taken into consideration again. In order to\ntackle this problem, we introduce a flexible graph model for microdata in a\nmetric space and propose a linkage attack based on realistic assumptions of a\ndata snooper's background knowledge. This attack is based on the idea of\nfinding a maximum approximate common subgraph of two vertex-labelled and\nedge-weighted graphs. By adapting a standard argument from algorithmic graph\ntheory to our setup, this task is transformed to the maximum clique detection\nproblem in a corresponding product graph. Using a toy example and experimental\nresults on simulated data show that publishing even approximate distances could\nincrease the risk of identity disclosure unreasonably."

    "summary": "This paper investigates the relation between three different notions of\nprivacy: identifiability, differential privacy and mutual-information privacy.\nUnder a unified privacy-distortion framework, where the distortion is defined\nto be the Hamming distance of the input and output databases, we establish some\nfundamental connections between these three privacy notions. Given a distortion\nlevel $D$, define $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest (best)\nidentifiability level, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$ to be the smallest\ndifferential privacy level. We characterize $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$ and\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)$, and prove that\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)-\\epsilon_X\\le\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{d}}^*(D)\\le\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}^*(D)$\nfor $D$ in some range, where $\\epsilon_X$ is a constant depending on the\ndistribution of the original database $X$, and diminishes to zero when the\ndistribution of $X$ is uniform. Furthermore, we show that identifiability and\nmutual-information privacy are consistent in the sense that given distortion\nlevel $D$, the mechanism that optimizes the mutual-information privacy also\nminimizes the identifiability level."

    "summary": "We calculate the probability of success of block-hiding mining strategies in\nBitcoin-like networks. These strategies involve building a secret branch of the\nblock-tree and publishing it opportunistically, aiming to replace the top of\nthe main branch and rip the reward associated with the secretly mined blocks.\nWe identify two types of block-hiding strategies and chart the parameter space\nwhere those are more beneficial than the standard mining strategy described in\nNakamoto's paper. Our analysis suggests a generalization of the notion of the\nrelative hashing power as a measure for a miner's influence on the network.\nBlock-hiding strategies are beneficial only when this measure of influence\nexceeds a certain threshold."

    "summary": "A new digital image encryption method based on fast compressed sensing\napproach using structurally random matrices and Arnold transform is proposed.\nConsidering the natural images to be compressed in any domain, the fast\ncompressed sensing based approach saves computational time, increases the\nquality of the image and reduces the dimension of the digital image by choosing\neven 25 % of the measurements. First, dimension reduction is utilized to\ncompress the digital image with scrambling effect. Second, Arnold\ntransformation is used to give the reduced digital image into more complex\nform. Then, the complex image is again encrypted by double random phase\nencoding process embedded with a host image; two random keys with fractional\nFourier transform are been used as a secret keys. At the receiver, the\ndecryption process is recovered by using TwIST algorithm. Experimental results\nincluding peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio between the original and\nreconstructed image are shown to analyze the validity of this technique and\ndemonstrated our proposed method to be secure, fast, complex and robust."

    "summary": "Popularity and complexity of malicious mobile applications are rising, making\ntheir analysis difficult and labor intensive. Mobile application analysis is\nindeed inherently different from desktop application analysis: In the latter,\nthe interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for the malware to\ncorrectly expose all its malicious behaviors.\n  We propose a novel approach to analyze (malicious) mobile applications. The\ngoal is to exercise the user interface (UI) of an Android application to\neffectively trigger malicious behaviors, automatically. Our key intuition is to\nrecord and reproduce the UI interactions of a potential victim of the malware,\nso as to stimulate the relevant behaviors during dynamic analysis. To make our\napproach scale, we automatically re-execute the recorded UI interactions on\napps that are similar to the original ones. These characteristics make our\nsystem orthogonal and complementary to current dynamic analysis and\nUI-exercising approaches.\n  We developed our approach and experimentally shown that our stimulation\nallows to reach a higher code coverage than automatic UI exercisers, so to\nunveil interesting malicious behaviors that are not exposed when using other\napproaches.\n  Our approach is also suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push\nfurther the collection of new stimulation traces. This can potentially change\nthe way we conduct dynamic analysis of (mobile) applications, from fully\nautomatic only, to user-centric and collaborative too."

By studying\nbinary sequences with the minimum Hamming weight, a new tool named as hypercube\ntheory is developed for $p^n$-periodic binary sequences. In fact, hypercube\ntheory is based on a typical sequence decomposition and it is a very important\ntool in investigating the critical error linear complexity spectrum proposed by\nEtzion et al. To demonstrate the importance of hypercube theory, we first give\na standard hypercube decomposition based on a well-known algorithm for\ncomputing linear complexity and show that the linear complexity of the first\nhypercube in the decomposition is equal to the linear complexity of the\noriginal sequence. Second, based on such decomposition, we give a complete\ncharacterization for the first decrease of the linear complexity for a\n$p^n$-periodic binary sequence $s$. This significantly improves the current\nexisting results in literature. As to the importance of the hypercube, we\nfinally derive a counting formula for the $m$-hypercubes with the same linear\ncomplexity."

    "summary": "Fault attacks against embedded circuits enabled to define many new attack\npaths against secure circuits. Every attack path relies on a specific fault\nmodel which defines the type of faults that the attacker can perform. On\nembedded processors, a fault model consisting in an assembly instruction skip\ncan be very useful for an attacker and has been obtained by using several fault\ninjection means. To avoid this threat, some countermeasure schemes which rely\non temporal redundancy have been proposed. Nevertheless, double fault injection\nin a long enough time interval is practical and can bypass those countermeasure\nschemes. Some fine-grained countermeasure schemes have also been proposed for\nspecific instructions. However, to the best of our knowledge, no approach that\nenables to secure a generic assembly program in order to make it fault-tolerant\nto instruction skip attacks has been formally proven yet. In this paper, we\nprovide a fault-tolerant replacement sequence for almost all the instructions\nof the Thumb-2 instruction set and provide a formal verification for this fault\ntolerance. This simple transformation enables to add a reasonably good security\nlevel to an embedded program and makes practical fault injection attacks much\nharder to achieve."

    "summary": "This paper addresses an interesting security problem in wireless ad hoc\nnetworks: the Dynamic Group Key Agreement key establishment. For secure group\ncommunication in an Ad hoc network, a group key shared by all group members is\nrequired. This group key should be updated when there are membership changes\n(when the new member joins or current member leaves) in the group. In this\npaper, We propose a novel, secure, scalable and efficient Region-Based Group\nKey Agreement protocol (RBGKA) for ad-hoc networks. This is implemented by a\ntwo-level structure and a new scheme of group key update. The idea is to divide\nthe group into subgroups, each maintaining its subgroup keys using Group\nDiffie-Hellman (GDH) Protocol and links with other subgroups in a Tree\nstructure using Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) protocol. By introducing\nregion-based approach, messages and key updates will be limited within subgroup\nand outer group; hence computation load is distributed among many hosts. Both\ntheoretical analysis and experimental results show that this Region-based key\nagreement protocol performs better for the key establishment problem in ad-hoc\nnetwork in terms of memory cost, computation cost and communication cost."

    "summary": "The establishment of trust relationships to a computing platform relies on\nvalidation processes. Validation allows an external entity to build trust in\nthe expected behaviour of the platform based on provided evidence of the\nplatform's configuration. In a process like remote attestation, the 'trusted'\nplatform submits verification data created during a start up process. These\ndata consist of hardware-protected values of platform configuration registers,\ncontaining nested measurement values, e.g., hash values, of loaded or started\ncomponents. Commonly, the register values are created in linear order by a\nhardware-secured operation. Fine-grained diagnosis of components, based on the\nlinear order of verification data and associated measurement logs, is not\noptimal. We propose a method to use tree-formed verification data to validate a\nplatform. Component measurement values represent leaves, and protected\nregisters represent roots of a hash tree. We describe the basic mechanism of\nvalidating a platform using tree-formed measurement logs and root registers and\nshow an logarithmic speed-up for the search of faults. Secure creation of a\ntree is possible using a limited number of hardware-protected registers and a\nsingle protected operation.

There have been some key agreement or predistribution\nschemes with the property that the key can be established without the\ninteraction (\\cite{Blom84,BSHKY92,S97}). Recently the hierarchical cryptography\nand the key management for hierarchical networks have been active topics(see\n\\cite{BBG05,GHKRRW08,GS02,HNZI02,HL02,Matt04}. ). Key agreement schemes for\nhierarchical networks were presented in \\cite{Matt04,GHKRRW08} which is based\non the Blom key predistribution scheme(Blom KPS, [1]) and pairing. In this\npaper we introduce generalized Blom-Blundo et al key predistribution schemes.\nThese generalized Blom-Blundo et al key predistribution schemes have the same\nsecurity functionality as the Blom-Blundo et al KPS. However different and\nrandom these KPSs can be used for various parts of the networks for enhancing\nthe resilience. We also presentkey predistribution schemes from a family\nhyperelliptic curves. These key predistribution schemes from different random\ncurves can be used for various parts of hierarchical networks. Then the\nnon-interactive, identity-based and dynamic key predistributon scheme based on\nthis generalized Blom-Blundo et al KPSs and hyperelliptic curve KPSs for\nhierarchical networks with the following properties are constructed.\n1)$O(A_KU)$ storage at each node in the network where $U$ is the expansion\nnumber and $A_K$ is the number of nodes at the $K$-th level of the hierarchical\nnetwork; 2)Strongly resilience to the compromising of arbitrary many leaf and\ninternal nodes; 3)Information theoretical security without random oracle."

In contrast to HB, NLHB relies on\nthe complexity of decoding a class of non-linear codes to render the passive\nattacks proposed against HB ineffective. In this paper, we show that passive\nattacks against HB protocol can still be applicable to NLHB and this protocol\ndoes not provide the desired security margin. In our attack, we first linearize\nthe non-linear part of NLHB to obtain a HB equivalent for NLHB, and then\nexploit the passive attack techniques proposed for the HB to evaluate the\nsecurity margin of NLHB. The results show that although NLHB's security margin\nis relatively higher than HB against similar passive attack techniques, it has\nbeen overestimated and, in contrary to what is claimed, NLHB is vulnerable to\npassive attacks against HB, especially when the noise vector in the protocol\nhas a low weight."

PadSteg utilizes ARP and TCP protocols together with an\nEtherleak vulnerability (improper Ethernet frame padding) to facilitate secret\ncommunication for hidden groups in LANs (Local Area Networks).

    "summary": "Modern distributed communication networks like the Internet and\ncensorship-resistant networks (also a part of the Internet) are characterized\nby nodes (users) interconnected with one another via communication links. In\nthis regard, the security of individual nodes depend not only on their own\nefforts, but also on the efforts and underlying connectivity structure of\nneighboring network nodes. By the term 'effort', we imply the amount of\ninvestments made by a user in security mechanisms like antivirus softwares,\nfirewalls, etc., to improve its security. However, often due to the large\nmagnitude of such networks, it is not always possible for nodes to have\ncomplete effort and connectivity structure information about all their neighbor\nnodes. Added to this is the fact that in many applications, the Internet users\nare selfish and are not willing to co-operate with other users on sharing\neffort information. In this paper, we adopt a non-cooperative game-theoretic\napproach to analyze individual user security in a communication network by\naccounting for both, the partial information that a network node possess about\nits underlying neighborhood connectivity structure, as well as the presence of\npositive externalities arising from efforts exerted by neighboring nodes. We\ninvestigate the equilibrium behavior of nodes and show 1) the existence of\nsymmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria of efforts and 2) better connected nodes\nchoose lower efforts to exert but earn higher utilities with respect to\nsecurity improvement irrespective of the nature of node degree correlations\namongst the neighboring nodes. Our results provide ways for Internet users to\nappropriately invest in security mechanisms under realistic environments of\ninformation uncertainty."

Unfortunately, recent\nresearch has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk\nmounted by a running machine\\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the\ncold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using\nstate-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an\nattacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is\napplicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily\nsupposed to defend: an adversary with physical access. To our knowledge, no\neffective software-based countermeasure to this attack supporting multiple\nencryption keys has yet been articulated in the literature. Moreover, since no\nproposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all\ngeneral-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present\nLoop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel\ntechnique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer\ntheoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack,\nverify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present\nmeasurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is\nlimited to a slowdown of approximately 2x.

More\nspecifically, we study secrecy enhancement of DES block cipher working in\ncipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable and intentional noise is introduced\ninto encrypted data in application layer. A verification strategy in exhaustive\nsearch step of linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful\nattack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is\ncreated over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's\ncryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel\nstates at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be\ndelivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over super-frames ahead of\nencryption, namely, our proposed secrecy encoding-then-encryption scheme. These\nsecrecy bits could be taken as symmetric keys for upcoming frames. Numerical\nresults indicate that a sufficiently large secrecy rate can be achieved by\nselective noise addition."

    "summary": "Many operations in power grids, such as fault detection and event location\nestimation, depend on precise timing information. In this paper, a novel Time\nSynchronization Attack (TSA) is proposed to attack the timing information in\nsmart grid. Since many applications in smart grid utilize synchronous\nmeasurements and most of the measurement devices are equipped with global\npositioning system (GPS) for precise timing, it is highly probable to attack\nthe measurement system by spoofing the GPS. The effectiveness of TSA is\ndemonstrated for three applications of phasor measurement unit (PMU) in smart\ngrid, namely transmission line fault detection, voltage stability monitoring\nand event locationing. The validity of TSA is demonstrated by numerical\nsimulations."

    "summary": "A novel time synchronization attack (TSA) on wide area monitoring systems in\nsmart grid has been identified in the first part of this paper. A cross layer\ndetection mechanism is proposed to combat TSA in part II of this paper. In the\nphysical layer, we propose a GPS carrier signal noise ratio (C/No) based\nspoofing detection technique. In addition, a patch-monopole hybrid antenna is\napplied to receive GPS signal. By computing the standard deviation of the C/No\ndifference from two GPS receivers, a priori probability of spoofing detection\nis fed to the upper layer, where power system state is estimated and\ncontrolled. A trustworthiness based evaluation method is applied to identify\nthe PMU being under TSA. Both the physical layer and upper layer algorithms are\nintegrated to detect the TSA, thus forming a cross layer mechanism. Experiment\nis carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed TSA detection\nalgorithm."

    "summary": "The characteristic novelty of what is generally meant by a \"physical\nunclonable function\" (PUF) is precisely defined, in order to supply a firm\nbasis for security evaluations and the proposal of new security mechanisms. A\nPUF is defined as a hardware device which implements a physical function with\nan output value that changes with its argument. A PUF can be clonable, but a\nsecure PUF must be unclonable. This proposed meaning of a PUF is cleanly\ndelineated from the closely related concepts of \"conventional unclonable\nfunction\", \"physically obfuscated key\", \"random-number generator\", \"controlled\nPUF\" and \"strong PUF\". The structure of a systematic security evaluation of a\nPUF enabled by the proposed formal definition is outlined. Practically all\ncurrent and novel physical (but not conventional) unclonable physical functions\nare PUFs by our definition. Thereby the proposed definition captures the\nexisting intuition about what is a PUF and remains flexible enough to encompass\nfurther research. In a second part we quantitatively characterize two classes\nof PUF security mechanisms, the standard one, based on a minimum secret\nread-out time, and a novel one, based on challenge-dependent erasure of stored\ninformation. The new mechanism is shown to allow in principle the construction\nof a \"quantum-PUF\", that is absolutely secure while not requiring the storage\nof an exponentially large secret. The construction of a PUF that is\nmathematically and physically unclonable in principle does not contradict the\nlaws of physics."

    "summary": "Web applications require exchanging parameters between a client and a server\nto function properly. In real-world systems such as online banking transfer,\ntraversing multiple pages with parameters contributed by both the user and\nserver is a must, and hence the applications have to enforce workflow and\nparameter dependency controls across multiple requests. An application that\napplies insufficient server-side input validations is however vulnerable to\nparameter tampering attacks, which manipulate the exchanged parameters.\nExisting fuzzing-based scanning approaches however neglected these important\ncontrols, and this caused their fuzzing requests to be dropped before they can\nreach any vulnerable code.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the workflow and\nparameter dependent constraints, which are then maintained and leveraged for\nautomatic detection of server acceptances during fuzzing. We realized the\napproach by building a generic blackbox parameter tampering scanner. It\nsuccessfully uncovered a number of severe vulnerabilities, including one from\nthe largest multi-national banking website, which other scanners miss."

    "summary": "In this paper, a new image encryption scheme using a secret key of 144-bits\nis proposed. In the substitution process of the scheme, image is divided into\nblocks and subsequently into color components. Each color component is modified\nby performing bitwise operation which depends on secret key as well as a few\nmost significant bits of its previous and next color component. Three rounds\nare taken to complete substitution process. To make cipher more robust, a\nfeedback mechanism is also applied by modifying used secret key after\nencrypting each block. Further, resultant image is partitioned into several key\nbased dynamic sub-images. Each sub-image passes through the scrambling process\nwhere pixels of sub-image are reshuffled within itself by using a generated\nmagic square matrix. Five rounds are taken for scrambling process. The propose\nscheme is simple, fast and sensitive to the secret key. Due to high order of\nsubstitution and permutation, common attacks like linear and differential\ncryptanalysis are infeasible. The experimental results show that the proposed\nencryption technique is efficient and has high security features."

It is of utmost importance to be able to adopt extreme security\nmeasures in certain high-risk situations in order to secure critical\ninfrastructure and thus lower the level of terrorist threats while preserving\nthe rights of citizens. To counter these threats, our research is aiming for\nextreme measures to analyse and evaluate human threats related assessment\nmethods for employee screening and evaluations using cognitive analysis\ntechnology, in particular functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The\ndevelopment of fMRI has led some researchers to conclude that this technology\nhas forensic potential and may be useful in investing personality traits,\nmental illness, psychopathology, racial prejudice and religious extremism.\nHowever, critics claim that this technology may present many new human rights\nand ethical dilemmas and could result in potentially disastrous outcomes. The\nmain thrust of the research is to counter above concerns and harmful\nconsequences by presenting a set of ethical and professional guidelines that\nwill substantially reduce the risk of unethical use of this technology. The\nsignificance of this research is to ensure the limits of the\nstate/organisation's right to peer into an individual's thought process with\nand without consent, to define the parameters of a person's right to ensure\nthat fMRI scans do not pose more than an appropriate threat to cognitive\nliberty, and the proper use of such information in civil, forensic and security\nsettings."

On the one hand, users need to register in each server and to\nstore large sets of data, including identities and passwords. On the other\nhand, servers are required to store a verification table containing user\nidentities and passwords. Recently, On the base on Sood et al.'s\nprotocol(2011), Li et al. proposed an improved dynamic identity based\nauthentication and key agreement protocol for multi-server architecture(2012).\nLi et al. claims that the proposed scheme can make up the security weaknesses\nof Sood et al.'s protocol. Unfortunately, our further research shows that Li et\nal.'s protocol contains several drawbacks and can not resist some types of\nknown attacks, such as replay attack, Deny-of-Service attack, internal attack,\neavesdropping attack, masquerade attack, and so on. In this paper, we further\npropose a light dynamic pseudonym identity based authentication and key\nagreement protocol for multi-server architecture. In our scheme, service\nproviding servers don't need to maintain verification tables for users. The\nproposed protocol provides not only the declared security features in Li et\nal.'s paper, but also some other security features, such as traceability and\nidentity protection."

    "summary": "In Europe and North America, the most widely used stream cipher to ensure\nprivacy and confidentiality of conversations in GSM mobile phones is the A5/1.\nIn this paper, we present a new attack on the A5/1 stream cipher with an\naverage time complexity of 2^(48.5), which is much less than the brute-force\nattack with a complexity of 2^(64). The attack has a 100% success rate and\nrequires about 5.65GB storage. We provide a detailed description of our new\nattack along with its implementation and results."

    "summary": "Searching accounts for one of the most frequently performed computations over\nthe Internet as well as one of the most important applications of outsourced\ncomputing, producing results that critically affect users' decision-making\nbehaviors. As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over\nvast amounts of web contents is essential.\n  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce\nthe concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and\nprototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a\ntrusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web\ncontents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to\nbe correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This\nsignature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,\nsuch as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages\nthat satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a\ncryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any\nuser to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the\nresult computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming\nwith the query are included in the result. An important property of our\nsolution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on\nthe sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number\nor sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.\n  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more\ninvolved bilinear-map accumulators. As we experimentally demonstrate, the\nprototype implementation of our system gives a low communication overhead\nbetween the search engine and the user, and allows for fast verification of the\nreturned results on the user side."

    "summary": "Denial of service (DoS) attacks and more particularly the distributed ones\n(DDoS) are one of the latest threat and pose a grave danger to users,\norganizations and infrastructures of the Internet. Several schemes have been\nproposed on how to detect some of these attacks, but they suffer from a range\nof problems, some of them being impractical and others not being effective\nagainst these attacks. This paper reports the design principles and evaluation\nresults of our proposed framework that autonomously detects and accurately\ncharacterizes a wide range of flooding DDoS attacks in ISP network. Attacks are\ndetected by the constant monitoring of propagation of abrupt traffic changes\ninside ISP network. For this, a newly designed flow-volume based approach\n(FVBA) is used to construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the\nnetwork, and identify anomalies whenever traffic goes out of profile.\nConsideration of varying tolerance factors make proposed detection system\nscalable to the varying network conditions and attack loads in real time.\nSix-sigma method is used to identify threshold values accurately for malicious\nflows characterization. FVBA has been extensively evaluated in a controlled\ntest-bed environment. Detection thresholds and efficiency is justified using\nreceiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For validation, KDD 99, a\npublicly available benchmark dataset is used. The results show that our\nproposed system gives a drastic improvement in terms of detection and false\nalarm rate."

    "summary": "Baldi et \\textit{al.} proposed a variant of McEliece's cryptosystem. The main\nidea is to replace its permutation matrix by adding to it a rank 1 matrix. The\nmotivation for this change is twofold: it would allow the use of codes that\nwere shown to be insecure in the original McEliece's cryptosystem, and it would\nreduce the key size while keeping the same security against generic decoding\nattacks. The authors suggest to use generalized Reed-Solomon codes instead of\nGoppa codes. The public code built with this method is not anymore a\ngeneralized Reed-Solomon code. On the other hand, it contains a very large\nsecret generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we present an attack that\nis built upon a distinguisher which is able to identify elements of this secret\ncode. The distinguisher is constructed by considering the code generated by\ncomponent-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so-called \"square\ncode\"). By using square-code dimension considerations, the initial generalized\nReed-Solomon code can be recovered which permits to decode any ciphertext. A\nsimilar technique has already been successful for mounting an attack against a\nhomomorphic encryption scheme suggested by Bogdanoc et \\textit{al.}. This work\ncan be viewed as another illustration of how a distinguisher of Reed-Solomon\ncodes can be used to devise an attack on cryptosystems based on them."

Attacker can also launch devastating denial of\nservice (DoS) attacks, even when the connection between the client and the\nserver is secured with SSL/TLS. The attacks are practical and require a puppet\n(malicious script in browser sandbox) running on a the victim client machine,\nand attacker capable of IP-spoofing on the Internet. Our attacks use a\ntechnique allowing an off-path attacker to learn the sequence numbers of both\nclient and server in a TCP connection. The technique exploits the fact that\nmany computers, in particular those running Windows, use a global IP-ID\ncounter, which provides a side channel allowing efficient exposure of the\nconnection sequence numbers. We present results of experiments evaluating the\nlearning technique and the attacks that exploit it. Finally, we present\npractical defenses that can be deployed at the firewall level; no changes to\nexisting TCP/IP stacks are required."

    "summary": "Bots, in recent times, have posed a major threat to enterprise networks. With\nthe distributed nature of the way in which botnets operate, the problems faced\nby enterprises have become acute. A bot is a program that operates as an agent\nfor a user and runs automated tasks over the internet, at a much higher rate\nthan would be possible for a human alone. A collection of bots in a network,\nused for malicious purposes, is referred to as a botnet. In this paper we\nsuggested a distributed, co-operative approach towards detecting botnets is a\ngiven network which is inspired by the gossip protocol. Each node in a given\nnetwork runs a standalone agent that computes a suspicion value for that node\nafter regular intervals. Each node in the network exchanges its suspicion\nvalues with every other node in the network at regular intervals. The use of\ngossip protocol ensures that if a node in the network is compromised, all other\nnodes in the network are informed about it as soon as possible. Each node also\nensures that at any instance, by means of the gossip protocol, it maintains the\nlatest suspicion values of all the other nodes in the network."

    "summary": "In recent years, radio frequency identification technology has moved into the\nmainstream applications that help to speed up handling of manufactured goods\nand materials. RFID tags are divided into two classes: active and passive.\nActive tag requires a power source that's why its cost is more than passive\ntags. However, the low-cost RFID tags are facing new challenges to security and\nprivacy. Some solutions utilize expensive cryptographic primitives such as hash\nor encryption functions, and some lightweight approaches have been reported to\nbe not secure.\n  This paper describes a lightweight Mutual authentication and ownership\ntransfer protocol utilizing minimalistic cryptography using Physically\nUnclonable Functions (PUF) and Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). PUFs and\nLFSRs are very efficient in hardware and particularly suitable for the low-cost\nRFID tags. To functioning security in low cost RFID tag minimum gate\nrequirement is 2000 gates. To implement security protocols using PUF and LFSR\nfunctions need only approx 800 gates. In this paper it is explained how we can\nauthenticate and transfer ownership of low cost RFID tag securely using LFSR\nand PUF as compared to existing solutions based on hash functions."

    "summary": "Open communication over the Internet poses a serious threat to countries with\nrepressive regimes, leading them to develop and deploy network-based censorship\nmechanisms within their networks. Existing censorship circumvention systems\nface different difficulties in providing unobservable communication with their\nclients; this limits their availability and poses threats to their users. To\nprovide the required unobservability, several recent circumvention systems\nsuggest modifying Internet routers running outside the censored region to\nintercept and redirect packets to censored destinations. However, these\napproaches require modifications to ISP networks, and hence requires\ncooperation from ISP operators and/or network equipment vendors, presenting a\nsubstantial deployment challenge. In this report we propose a deployable and\nunobservable censorship-resistant infrastructure, called FreeWave. FreeWave\nworks by modulating a client's Internet connections into acoustic signals that\nare carried over VoIP connections. Such VoIP connections are targeted to a\nserver, FreeWave server, that extracts the tunneled traffic of clients and\nproxies them to the uncensored Internet. The use of actual VoIP connections, as\nopposed to traffic morphing, allows FreeWave to relay its VoIP connections\nthrough oblivious VoIP nodes, hence keeping itself unblockable from censors\nthat perform IP address blocking. Also, the use of end-to-end encryption\nprevents censors from identifying FreeWave's VoIP connections using packet\ncontent filtering technologies, like deep-packet inspection. We prototype the\ndesigned FreeWave system over the popular VoIP system of Skype. We show that\nFreeWave is able to reliably achieve communication bandwidths that are\nsufficient for web browsing, even when clients are far distanced from the\nFreeWave server."

    "summary": "This paper proposes an oblivious watermarking algorithm with blind detection\napproach for high volume data hiding in image signals. We present a detection\nreliable signal adaptive embedding scheme for multiple messages in selective\nsub-bands of wavelet (DWT) coefficients using direct sequence spread spectrum\n(DS-SS) modulation technique. Here the impact of volumetric distortion sources\nis analyzed on the ability of analytical bounds in order to recover the\nwatermark messages. In this context, the joint source-channel coding scheme has\nbeen employed to obtain the better control of the system robustness. This\nstructure prevents the desynchronisation between encoder and decoder due to\nselective embedding. The experimental results obtained for Spread Spectrum (SS)\ntransformed domain watermarking demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nsystem. This algorithmic architecture utilizes the existing allocated bandwidth\nin the data transmission channel in a more efficient manner."

    "summary": "The current paper presents a robust watermarking method for still images,\nwhich uses the similarity of discrete wavelet transform and human visual system\n(HVS). The proposed scheme makes the use of pixel wise masking in order to make\nbinary watermark imperceptible to the HVS. The watermark is embedded in the\nperceptually significant, spatially selected detail coefficients using sub band\nadaptive threshold scheme. The threshold is computed based on the statistical\nanalysis of the wavelet coefficients. The watermark is embedded several times\nto achieve better robustness. Here, a new type of non-oblivious detection\nmethod is proposed. The improvement in robustness performance against different\ntypes of deliberate and non-intentional image impairments (lossy compression,\nscaling, cropping, filtering etc) is supported through experimental results.\nThe reported result also shows improvement in visual and statistical\ninvisibility of the hidden data. The proposed method is compared with a state\nof the art frequency based watermarking technique, highlighting its\nperformance. This algorithmic architecture utilizes the existing allocated\nbandwidth in the data transmission channel in a more efficient manner."

The approach exploits two-predecessor single attractor\n(TPSA) cellular automata (CA) suitability to work as efficient authentication\nfunction in wavelet based SS watermarking domain. The scheme is designed from\nthe analytical study of state transition behaviour of non-group CA and the\nbasic cryptography/encryption scheme is significantly different from the\nconventional SS data hiding approaches. Experimental studies confirm that the\nscheme is robust in terms of confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation\nand integrity. The transform domain blind watermarking technique offers better\nvisual & statistical imperceptibility and resiliency against different types of\nintentional & unintentional image degradations. Interleaving and interference\ncancellation methods are employed to improve the robustness performance\nsignificantly compared to conventional matched filter detection."

It has been observed that the resulting complex\nfirewall network is highly error prone and causes serious security holes.\nHence, automated solutions are needed in order to check its correctness. In\nthis paper, we propose a formal and automatic method for checking whether\nmultiple firewalls react correctly with respect to a security policy given in a\nhigh level declarative language. When errors are detected, some useful feedback\nis returned in order to correct the firewall configurations. Furthermore, we\npropose a priority-based approach to ensure that no incoherencies exist within\nthe security policy. We show that our method is both correct and complete.\nFinally, it has been implemented in a prototype of verifier based on a\nsatisfiability solver modulo theories.

    "summary": "Group communication can benefit from Internet Protocol (IP) multicast\nprotocol to achieve efficient exchange of messages. However, IP multicast does\nnot provide any mechanisms for authentication. In literature, many solutions to\nsolve this problem were presented. It has been shown that Wong and Lam protocol\nis the only protocol that can resist both packet loss and pollution attacks. In\ncontrast, it has high computation and communication overheads. In the present\npaper, an efficient design for the implementation of Wong and Lam multicast\nauthentication protocol is proposed. In order to solve the computation overhead\nproblem, we use two-levels of parallelism. To reduce the communication\noverhead, we use Universal Message Authentication Codes (UMAC) instead of hash\nfunctions. The design is analyzed for both NTRU and elliptic curve cryptography\nsignature algorithms. The analysis shows that the proposed design decreases\nsignificantly the execution time of Wong-Lam protocol which makes it suitable\nfor real-time applications."

    "summary": "In recent years, several protocols for password-based authenticated key\nexchange have been proposed. These protocols aim to be secure even though the\nsample space of passwords may be small enough to be enumerated by an off-line\nadversary. In Eurocrypt 2000, Bellare, Pointcheval and Rogaway (BPR) presented\na model and security definition for authenticated key exchange. They claimed\nthat in the ideal-cipher model (random oracles), the two-flow protocol at the\ncore of Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) is secure. Bellare and Rogaway suggested\nseveral instantiations of the ideal cipher in their proposal to the IEEE\nP1363.2 working group. Since then there has been an increased interest in\nproving the security of password-based protocols in the ideal-cipher model. For\nexample, Bresson, Chevassut, and Pointcheval have recently showed that the\nOne-Encryption-Key-Exchange (OEKE) protocol is secure in the ideal cipher\nmodel. In this paper, we present examples of real (NOT ideal) ciphers\n(including naive implementations of the instantiations proposed to IEEE\nP1363.2) that would result in broken instantiations of the idealised AuthA\nprotocol and OEKE protocol. Our result shows that the AuthA protocol can be\ninstantiated in an insecure way, and that there are no well defined (let alone\nrigorous) ways to distinguish between secure and insecure instantiations. Thus,\nwithout a rigorous metric for ideal-ciphers, the value of provable security in\nideal cipher model is limited."

In a typical scenario, a smart card owner inserts the smart card into\nan untrusted card reader and input the password via the card reader in order\nfor the smart card to carry out the process of authentication with a remote\nserver. In this case, we want to guarantee that the card reader will not be\nable to impersonate the card owner in future without the smart card itself.\nFurthermore, the smart card could be stolen.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the Sudoku configuration\nprovides us a new alternative way of matrix element representation by using\nblock-grid pair besides the conventional row-column pair. Moreover, we discover\nsix more matrix element representations by using row-digit pair, digit-row\npair, column-digit pair, digit-column pair, block-digit pair, and digit-block\npair associated with a Sudoku matrix. These parametric Sudoku associated matrix\nelement representations not only allow us to denote matrix elements in secret\nways, but also provide us new parametric two-dimensional bijective mappings. We\nstudy these two-dimensional bijections in the problem of image scrambling and\npropose a simple but effective Sudoku Associated Image Scrambler only using\nSudoku associated two dimensional bijections for image scrambling without\nbandwidth expansion. Our simulation results over a wide collection of image\ntypes and contents demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed\nmethod. Scrambler performance analysis with comparisons to peer algorithms\nunder various investigation methods, including human visual inspections, gray\ndegree of scrambling, autocorrelation coefficient of adjacent pixels, and key\nspace and key sensitivities, suggest that the proposed method outperforms or at\nleast reaches state-of-the-art.

    "summary": "Today, Internet offers many critical applications. So, it becomes very\ncrucial for Internet service providers to ensure traceability of operations and\nto secure data exchange. Since all these communications are based on the use of\nthe Domain Name System (DNS) protocol, it becomes necessary to think to enhance\nand secure it by proposing a secure version of this protocol that can correct\nthe whole or a part of the DNS protocol weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In this\ncontext, DNSsec was created by the IETF to ensure the integrity of DNS data and\nauthentication of the source of such data. DNSsec is based on the key\ncryptography public to provide different security services. In the present\npaper, we will present first the DNS protocol and its weaknesses. After that,\nwe will be interested in studying the DNSsec implementation and data exchange,\nand then give a deep analysis of its weaknesses."

    "summary": "Developments in pervasive computing introduced a new world of computing where\nnetworked processors embedded and distributed in everyday objects communicating\nwith each other over wireless links. Computers in such environments work in the\nbackground while establishing connections among them dynamically and hence will\nbe less visible and intrusive. Such a vision raises questions about how to\nmanage issues like privacy, trust and identity in those environments. In this\npaper, we review the technical challenges that face pervasive computing\nenvironments in relation to each of these issues. We then present a number of\nsecurity related considerations and use them as a basis for comparison between\npervasive and traditional computing. We will argue that these considerations\npose particular concerns and challenges to the design and implementation of\npervasive environments which are different to those usually found in\ntraditional computing environments. To address these concerns and challenges,\nfurther research is needed. We will present a number of directions and topics\nfor possible future research with respect to each of the three issues."

Sensitive\ninformation might be mined from the raw data during the analysis, and this led\nto a great privacy concern among people (data providers) these days. To deal\nwith this privacy concerns, multitudes of privacy-preserving computation\nschemes are proposed to address various computation problems, and we have found\nmany of them fall into a class of problems which can be solved by greedy\nalgorithms.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed greedy algorithms in\nwhich instances in the feasible set come from different parties.

The existing works perform the research from\ntwo aspects, i.e., (a)secure key division and distributed storage, (b)secure\ndistributed authentication. But there still exist several unsolved problems.\nSpecifically, it may suffer from cheating problems and fault authentication\nattack, which can result in authentication failure and DoS attack towards\nauthentication service. Besides, most existing schemes are not with\nsatisfactory efficiency due to exponential arithmetic based on Shamir's scheme.\nIn this paper, we explore the property of verifiable secret sharing(VSS)\nschemes with Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), then propose a secret key\ndistributed storage scheme based on CRT-VSS and trusted computing for MANET.\nSpecifically, we utilize trusted computing technology to solve two existing\ncheating problems in secret sharing area before. After that, we do the analysis\nof homomorphism property with CRT-VSS and design the corresponding\nshares-product sharing scheme with better concision. On such basis, a secure\ndistributed Elliptic Curve-Digital Signature Standard signature (ECC-DSS)\nauthentication scheme based on CRT-VSS scheme and trusted computing is\nproposed. Furthermore, as an important property of authentication scheme, we\ndiscuss the refreshing property of CRT-VSS and do thorough comparisons with\nShamir's scheme. Finally, we provide formal guarantees towards our schemes\nproposed in this paper."

    "summary": "For the past decade, query processing on relational data has been studied\nextensively, and many theoretical and practical solutions to query processing\nhave been proposed under various scenarios. With the recent popularity of cloud\ncomputing, users now have the opportunity to outsource their data as well as\nthe data management tasks to the cloud. However, due to the rise of various\nprivacy issues, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to be encrypted\nbefore outsourcing to the cloud. In addition, query processing tasks should be\nhandled by the cloud; otherwise, there would be no point to outsource the data\nat the first place. To process queries over encrypted data without the cloud\never decrypting the data is a very challenging task. In this paper, we focus on\nsolving the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) query problem over encrypted database\noutsourced to a cloud: a user issues an encrypted query record to the cloud,\nand the cloud returns the k closest records to the user. We first present a\nbasic scheme and demonstrate that such a naive solution is not secure. To\nprovide better security, we propose a secure kNN protocol that protects the\nconfidentiality of the data, user's input query, and data access patterns.\nAlso, we empirically analyze the efficiency of our protocols through various\nexperiments. These results indicate that our secure protocol is very efficient\non the user end, and this lightweight scheme allows a user to use any mobile\ndevice to perform the kNN query."

    "summary": "Privacy-aware processing of personal data on the web of services requires\nmanaging a number of issues arising both from the technical and the legal\ndomain. Several approaches have been proposed to matching privacy requirements\n(on the clients side) and privacy guarantees (on the service provider side).\nStill, the assurance of effective data protection (when possible) relies on\nsubstantial human effort and exposes organizations to significant\n(non-)compliance risks. In this paper we put forward the idea that a privacy\ncertification scheme producing and managing machine-readable artifacts in the\nform of privacy certificates can play an important role towards the solution of\nthis problem. Digital privacy certificates represent the reasons why a privacy\nproperty holds for a service and describe the privacy measures supporting it.\nAlso, privacy certificates can be used to automatically select services whose\ncertificates match the client policies (privacy requirements).\n  Our proposal relies on an evolution of the conceptual model developed in the\nAssert4Soa project and on a certificate format specifically tailored to\nrepresent privacy properties. To validate our approach, we present a worked-out\ninstance showing how privacy property Retention-based unlinkability can be\ncertified for a banking financial service."

We call this\nattack on location privacy of people an \"exploiting radio windows\" (ERW)\nattack. We design and implement the ERW attack methodology for through wall\npeople localization that relies on reliably detecting when people cross the\nlink lines by using physical layer measurements between the legitimate\ntransmitters and the attack receivers. We also develop a method to estimate the\ndirection of movement of a person from the sequence of link lines crossed\nduring a short time interval. Additionally, we describe how an attacker may\nestimate any artificial changes in transmit power (used as a countermeasure),\ncompensate for these power changes using measurements from sufficient number of\nlinks, and still detect line crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi\nand ZigBee nodes and experimentally evaluate the ERW attack by monitoring\npeople movements through walls in two real-world settings.

In polynomial time it computes a reduced basis\nwith provable output quality. One early improvement of the LLL algorithm was\nLLL with deep insertions (DeepLLL). The output of this version of LLL has\nhigher quality in practice but the running time seems to explode. Weaker\nvariants of DeepLLL, where the insertions are restricted to blocks, behave\nnicely in practice concerning the running time. However no proof of polynomial\nrunning time is known. In this paper PotLLL, a new variant of DeepLLL with\nprovably polynomial running time, is presented. We compare the practical\nbehavior of the new algorithm to classical LLL, BKZ as well as blockwise\nvariants of DeepLLL regarding both the output quality and running time."

It offers a set of rules allowing differentiating\nbetween legitimate actions and prohibited ones and consequently, associates\neach entity in the network with a set of permissions and privileges. Moreover,\nin today's technological society and to allow applications perpetuity,\ncommunication networks must support the collaboration between entities to face\nup any unavailability or flinching. This collaboration must be governed by\nsecurity mechanisms according to the established permissions and privileges.\nDelegation is a common practice that is used to simplify the sharing of\nresponsibilities and privileges. The delegation process in a SP environment can\nbe implanted through the use of adequate formalisms and modeling. The main\ncontribution of this paper is then, the proposition of a generic and formal\nmodeling of delegation process. This modeling is based on three steps composing\nthe delegation life cycle: negotiation used for delegation initiation,\nverification of the SP respect while delegating and revocation of an\nestablished delegation. Hence, we propose to deal with each step according to\nthe main delegation characteristics and extend them by some new specificities."

    "summary": "The popularity of mobile device has made people's lives more convenient, but\nthreatened people's privacy at the same time. As end users are becoming more\nand more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even\nharder to track a specific user using conventional technologies. For example,\ncookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing\nUDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To\naddress this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones\nusing the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process.\nThese works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to\neach other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie\nand be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like\nuniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to\ngenerate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the\nfrequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies\nand special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear\neffects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to\nusers. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone\nspeaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information\nthat is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify\nbillions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype\nto evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can\nbe used as a replacement of cookie."

Each party is\ninterested in computing a function, which could differ from party to party, and\nthere could be a central observer interested in computing a separate function.\nPerformance at each party and the central observer is measured via the accuracy\nof the function computed. We allow for an arbitrary cost function to measure\nthe distortion between the true and the computed function value. Our main\nresult is the exact optimality of a simple non-interactive protocol: each party\nrandomizes (sufficiently) and publishes its own bit. In other words,\nnon-interactive randomized response is exactly optimal. Each party and the\ncentral observer then separately compute their respective function to maximize\nthe appropriate notion of their accuracy measure. The optimality is very\ngeneral: it holds for all types of functions, heterogeneous privacy conditions\non the parties, all types of cost metrics, and both average and worst-case\n(over the inputs) measures of accuracy. Finally, the optimality result is\nsimultaneous, in terms of maximizing accuracy at each of the parties and the\ncentral observer."

    "summary": "Content filtering in web browsers is a tedious process for most of the\npeople, because of several reasons. By blocking JavaScript, Cookies and Popups,\nend users can ensure maximum protection from browser based attacks and\nvulnerabilities. In order to accomplish this, we build an extension for Google\nChrome which allows users to have easy control over what they wish to recievce\nfrom a web page. We also build this extension in such a way that it remembers\nthe choice of options made by the user for every URLs, thereby letting users\ncreate rules for websites they visit."

    "summary": "Biometric key generation techniques are used to reliably generate\ncryptographic material from biometric signals. Existing constructions require\nusers to perform a particular activity (e.g., type or say a password, or\nprovide a handwritten signature), and are therefore not suitable for generating\nkeys continuously. In this paper we present a new technique for biometric key\ngeneration from free-text keystroke dynamics. This is the first technique\nsuitable for continuous key generation. Our approach is based on a scaled\nparity code for key generation (and subsequent key reconstruction), and can be\naugmented with the use of population data to improve security and reduce key\nreconstruction error. In particular, we rely on linear discriminant analysis\n(LDA) to obtain a better representation of discriminable biometric signals.\n  To update the LDA matrix without disclosing user's biometric information, we\ndesign a provably secure privacy-preserving protocol (PP-LDA) based on\nhomomorphic encryption. Our biometric key generation with PP-LDA was evaluated\non a dataset of 486 users. We report equal error rate around 5% when using LDA,\nand below 7% without LDA."

    "summary": "Opacity is a generic security property, that has been defined on (non\nprobabilistic) transition systems and later on Markov chains with labels. For a\nsecret predicate, given as a subset of runs, and a function describing the view\nof an external observer, the value of interest for opacity is a measure of the\nset of runs disclosing the secret. We extend this definition to the richer\nframework of Markov decision processes, where non deterministic choice is\ncombined with probabilistic transitions, and we study related decidability\nproblems with partial or complete observation hypotheses for the schedulers. We\nprove that all questions are decidable with complete observation and\n$\\omega$-regular secrets. With partial observation, we prove that all\nquantitative questions are undecidable but the question whether a system is\nalmost surely non opaque becomes decidable for a restricted class of\n$\\omega$-regular secrets, as well as for all $\\omega$-regular secrets under\nfinite-memory schedulers."

    "summary": "Previous research about sensor based attacks on Android platform focused\nmainly on accessing or controlling over sensitive device components, such as\ncamera, microphone and GPS. These approaches get data from sensors directly and\nneed corresponding sensor invoking permissions.\n  This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission\nbypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application (VoicEmployer)\nthrough the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an Android system built-in\nvoice assistant module -- Google Voice Search. Through Android Intent\nmechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice Search to the foreground, and\nthen plays prepared audio files (like \"call number 1234 5678\") in the\nbackground. Google Voice Search can recognize this voice command and execute\ncorresponding operations. With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge\nSMS/Email, access privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve\nremote control without any permission.\n  Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app, which\ncan be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even when the phone is\nsecurely locked with password. A prototype of VoicEmployer has been implemented\nto demonstrate the feasibility of GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly\nall Android devices equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by\nGVS-Attack. This study may inspire application developers and researchers\nrethink that zero permission doesn't mean safety and the speaker can be treated\nas a new attack surface."

    "summary": "With millions of apps that can be downloaded from official or third-party\nmarket, Android has become one of the most popular mobile platforms today.\nThese apps help people in all kinds of ways and thus have access to lots of\nuser's data that in general fall into three categories: sensitive data, data to\nbe shared with other apps, and non-sensitive data not to be shared with others.\nFor the first and second type of data, Android has provided very good storage\nmodels: an app's private sensitive data are saved to its private folder that\ncan only be access by the app itself, and the data to be shared are saved to\npublic storage (either the external SD card or the emulated SD card area on\ninternal FLASH memory). But for the last type, i.e., an app's non-sensitive and\nnon-shared data, there is a big problem in Android's current storage model\nwhich essentially encourages an app to save its non-sensitive data to shared\npublic storage that can be accessed by other apps. At first glance, it seems no\nproblem to do so, as those data are non-sensitive after all, but it implicitly\nassumes that app developers could correctly identify all sensitive data and\nprevent all possible information leakage from private-but-non-sensitive data.\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate that this is an invalid assumption with a\nthorough survey on information leaks of those apps that had followed Android's\nrecommended storage model for non-sensitive data. Our studies showed that\nhighly sensitive information from billions of users can be easily hacked by\nexploiting the mentioned problematic storage model. Although our empirical\nstudies are based on a limited set of apps, the identified problems are never\nisolated or accidental bugs of those apps being investigated. On the contrary,\nthe problem is rooted from the vulnerable storage model recommended by Android.\nTo mitigate the threat, we also propose a defense framework."

    "summary": "Security protocols are used in many of our daily-life applications, and our\nprivacy largely depends on their design. Formal verification techniques have\nproved their usefulness to analyse these protocols, but they become so complex\nthat modular techniques have to be developed. We propose several results to\nsafely compose security protocols. We consider arbitrary primitives modeled\nusing an equational theory, and a rich process algebra close to the applied pi\ncalculus.\n  Relying on these composition results, we are able to derive some security\nproperties on a protocol from the security analysis performed on each\nsub-protocol individually. We consider parallel composition and the case of\nkey-exchange protocols. Our results apply to deal with confidentiality but also\nprivacy-type properties (e.g. anonymity, unlinkability) expressed using a\nnotion of equivalence. We illustrate the usefulness of our composition results\non protocols from the 3G phone application and electronic passport."

    "summary": "As the amount of digital devices suspected of containing digital evidence\nincreases, case backlogs for digital investigations are also increasing in many\norganizations. To ensure timely investigation of requests, this work proposes\nthe use of signature-based methods for automated action instance approximation\nto automatically reconstruct past user activities within a compromised or\nsuspect system. This work specifically explores how multiple instances of a\nuser action may be detected using signature-based methods during a post-mortem\ndigital forensic analysis. A system is formally defined as a set of objects,\nwhere a subset of objects may be altered on the occurrence of an action. A\nnovel action-trace update time threshold is proposed that enables objects to be\ncategorized by their respective update patterns over time. By integrating time\ninto event reconstruction, the most recent action instance approximation as\nwell as limited past instances of the action may be differentiated and their\ntime values approximated. After the formal theory if signature-based event\nreconstruction is defined, a case study is given to evaluate the practicality\nof the proposed method."

    "summary": "Injection of transient faults can be used as a way to attack embedded\nsystems. On embedded processors such as microcontrollers, several studies\nshowed that such a transient fault injection with glitches or electromagnetic\npulses could corrupt either the data loads from the memory or the assembly\ninstructions executed by the circuit. Some countermeasure schemes which rely on\ntemporal redundancy have been proposed to handle this issue. Among them,\nseveral schemes add this redundancy at assembly instruction level. In this\npaper, we perform a practical evaluation for two of those countermeasure\nschemes by using a pulsed electromagnetic fault injection process on a 32-bit\nmicrocontroller. We provide some necessary conditions for an efficient\nimplementation of those countermeasure schemes in practice. We also evaluate\ntheir efficiency and highlight their limitations. To the best of our knowledge,\nno experimental evaluation of the security of such instruction-level\ncountermeasure schemes has been published yet."
