    "summary": "We investigate, in the Shannon model, the security of constructions\ncorresponding to double and (two-key) triple DES. That is, we consider\nF_{k1}(F_{k2}(.)) and F_{k1}(F_{k2}^{-1}(F_{k1}(.))) with the component\nfunctions being ideal ciphers. This models the resistance of these\nconstructions to ``generic'' attacks like meet in the middle attacks. We obtain\nthe first proof that composition actually increases the security of these\nconstructions in some meaningful sense. We compute a bound on the probability\nof breaking the double cipher as a function of the number of computations of\nthe base cipher made, and the number of examples of the composed cipher seen,\nand show that the success probability is the square of that for a single key\ncipher. The same bound holds for the two-key triple cipher. The first bound is\ntight and shows that meet in the middle is the best possible generic attack\nagainst the double cipher."

    "summary": "A security policy states the acceptable actions of an information system, as\nthe actions bear on security. There is a pressing need for organizations to\ndeclare their security policies, even informal statements would be better than\nthe current practice. But, formal policy statements are preferable to support\n(1) reasoning about policies, e.g., for consistency and completeness, (2)\nautomated enforcement of the policy, e.g., using wrappers around legacy systems\nor after the fact with an intrusion detection system, and (3) other formal\nmanipulation of policies, e.g., the composition of policies. We present LaSCO,\nthe Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of\ntwo parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what\nis allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO\nhave the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies\nare specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual\nview of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we\nprovide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be\nvery perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have\nfound to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of\npolicies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to\ndescribe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an\nobject-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating\nsystem objects. A LaSCO specification can be automatically translated into\nexecutable code that checks an invocation of a program with respect to a\npolicy. The implementation of LaSCO is in Java, and generates wrappers to check\nJava programs with respect to a policy."

    "summary": "In this dissertation, we present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints\non Objects, a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs\nand present a method for enforcing policies so expressed. Other approaches for\nstating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to\neither policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may\nbe expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable\nproperties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many\ndifferent systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail,\nuser friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal\nreasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs\nannotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy\napplies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse\napplications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems,\ndistributed systems, and networks.\n  Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for\nimplementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of\nthe system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO\nfor Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to\nfacilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a\nnetwork as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large\nnetworks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that\nenable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of\nprecisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and\nimplementing it on a system."

    "summary": "A proof is concurrent zero-knowledge if it remains zero-knowledge when many\ncopies of the proof are run in an asynchronous environment, such as the\nInternet. It is known that zero-knowledge is not necessarily preserved in such\nan environment. Designing concurrent zero-knowledge proofs is a fundamental\nissue in the study of zero-knowledge since known zero-knowledge protocols\ncannot be run in a realistic modern computing environment. In this paper we\npresent a concurrent zero-knowledge proof systems for all languages in NP.\nCurrently, the proof system we present is the only known proof system that\nretains the zero-knowledge property when copies of the proof are allowed to run\nin an asynchronous environment. Our proof system has $\\tilde{O}(\\log^2 k)$\nrounds (for a security parameter $k$), which is almost optimal, as it is shown\nby Canetti Kilian Petrank and Rosen that black-box concurrent zero-knowledge\nrequires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)$ rounds.\n  Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali introduced the notion of {\\em\nresettable} zero-knowledge, and modified an earlier version of our proof system\nto obtain the first resettable zero-knowledge proof system. This protocol\nrequires $k^{\\theta(1)}$ rounds.

In such a scheme, one makes\nuse of the property that in the given group the word problem has a polynomial\ntime solution, while the conjugacy problem has no known polynomial solution. An\nexample is the braid group from topology in which the word problem is solvable\nin polynomial time while the only known solutions to the conjugacy problem are\nexponential. The attack in this paper is based on having a canonical\nrepresentative of each string relative to which a length function may be\ncomputed. Hence the term length attack. Such canonical representatives are\nknown to exist for the braid group."

We explore the\nexact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key\ndifference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces\nand explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from\nstrand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in\nthe strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest\ncan be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in\nthe strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To\nhighlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand\nspaces can be extended to model more systems."

This provides the first alternative\nto Ajtai and Dwork's original 1996 cryptosystem. Our second result is a family\nof collision resistant hash functions which, apart from improving the security\nin terms of the unique shortest vector problem, is also the first example of an\nanalysis which is not based on Ajtai's iterative step. Surprisingly, both\nresults are derived from one theorem which presents two indistinguishable\ndistributions on the segment $[0,1)$.

    "summary": "Logs are one of the most fundamental resources to any security professional.\nIt is widely recognized by the government and industry that it is both\nbeneficial and desirable to share logs for the purpose of security research.\nHowever, the sharing is not happening or not to the degree or magnitude that is\ndesired. Organizations are reluctant to share logs because of the risk of\nexposing sensitive information to potential attackers. We believe this\nreluctance remains high because current anonymization techniques are weak and\none-size-fits-all--or better put, one size tries to fit all. We must develop\nstandards and make anonymization available at varying levels, striking a\nbalance between privacy and utility. Organizations have different needs and\ntrust other organizations to different degrees. They must be able to map\nmultiple anonymization levels with defined risks to the trust levels they share\nwith (would-be) receivers. It is not until there are industry standards for\nmultiple levels of anonymization that we will be able to move forward and\nachieve the goal of widespread sharing of logs for security researchers."

    "summary": "Chebyshev polynomials have been recently proposed for designing public-key\nsystems. Indeed, they enjoy some nice chaotic properties, which seem to be\nsuitable for use in Cryptography. Moreover, they satisfy a semi-group property,\nwhich makes possible implementing a trapdoor mechanism. In this paper we study\na public key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both\nencryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is\nquite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not\nsecure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding\nplaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce\nforgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out\nthat also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an\nauthentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are\nnot secure due to the aforementioned attack. We close the paper by discussing\nthe issues and the possibilities of constructing public key cryptosystems on\nreal numbers."

We consider the problem of authenticating requests and responses at\nthe SOAP-level, rather than relying on transport-level security. We propose a\nsecurity abstraction, inspired by earlier work on secure RPC, in which the\nmethods exported by a web service are annotated with one of three security\nlevels: none, authenticated, or both authenticated and encrypted. We model our\nabstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web\nservices. We describe the semantics of our object calculus by translating to a\nlower-level language with primitives for message passing and cryptography. To\nvalidate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the\ncorrect authentication of requests and responses. By appeal to the type theory\nfor cryptographic protocols of Gordon and Jeffrey's Cryptyc, we verify the\ncorrespondence assertions simply by typing.

    "summary": "During the last years, large-scale simulations of realistic physical\nenvironments which support the interaction of multiple participants over the\nInternet have become increasingly available and economically significant, most\nnotably in the computer gaming industry. Such systems, commonly called\nnetworked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server\narchitecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the\nsimulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural\nchoice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic\nintegrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the\nphysical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality\nof events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of\nsemantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive\npolicies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and\nare therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity\nprotocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to\naudit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates\nlow network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally\ndecouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the\nsimulation."

    "summary": "Internet worms have become a widespread threat to system and network\noperations. In order to fight them more efficiently, it is necessary to analyze\nnewly discovered worms and attack patterns. This paper shows how techniques\nbased on Kolmogorov Complexity can help in the analysis of internet worms and\nnetwork traffic. Using compression, different species of worms can be clustered\nby type. This allows us to determine whether an unknown worm binary could in\nfact be a later version of an existing worm in an extremely simple, automated,\nmanner. This may become a useful tool in the initial analysis of malicious\nbinaries. Furthermore, compression can also be useful to distinguish different\ntypes of network traffic and can thus help to detect traffic anomalies: Certain\nanomalies may be detected by looking at the compressibility of a network\nsession alone. We furthermore show how to use compression to detect malicious\nnetwork sessions that are very similar to known intrusion attempts. This\ntechnique could become a useful tool to detect new variations of an attack and\nthus help to prevent IDS evasion. We provide two new plugins for Snort which\ndemonstrate both approaches."

So far there have been many reliable detecting methods on\nvarious steganographic algorithms, while there are few approaches that can\nextract the hidden information. In this paper, the difficulty of extracting\nhidden information, which is essentially a kind of privacy, is analyzed with\ninformation-theoretic method in the terms of unicity distance of steganographic\nkey (abbreviated stego key). A lower bound for the unicity distance is\nobtained, which shows the relations between key rate, message rate, hiding\ncapacity and difficulty of extraction. Furthermore the extracting attack to\nsteganography is viewed as a special kind of cryptanalysis, and an effective\nmethod on recovering the stego key of popular LSB replacing steganography in\nspatial images is presented by combining the detecting technique of\nsteganalysis and correlation attack of cryptanalysis together. The analysis for\nthis method and experimental results on steganographic software ``Hide and Seek\n4.1\" are both accordant with the information-theoretic conclusion."

This\nrelationship illustrates that a software application is exploited by violating\nconstraints imposed by computer system resources and assumptions made about\ntheir usage. In other words, a vulnerability exists in the software application\nif it allows violation of these constraints and assumptions. The taxonomy\nclassifies these constraints and assumptions. The model also serves as a basis\nfor the classification scheme the taxonomy uses, in which the computer system\nresources such as, memory, input/output, and cryptographic resources serve as\ncategories and subcategories. Vulnerabilities, which are expressed in the form\nof constraints and assumptions, are classified according to these categories\nand subcategories. This taxonomy is both novel and distinctively different from\nother taxonomies found in the literature."

Some of\nthese assumptions, like having a \"secure\" chan- nel to transmit data, or having\nsound algorithms to check the correct- ness of the data, are not addressed by\nthis paper.

    "summary": "Basic role based access control [RBAC] provides a mechanism for segregating\naccess privileges based upon a user's hierarchical roles within an\norganization. This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of\nmultiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement\nfor different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our\ncase, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be\neffectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's\norganizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy\nto be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations\nare served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their\naccess as needed.\n  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for\naccurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies\nfor providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the\namount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.\nThe resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and\nvisualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will\ngive some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and\nprivileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges\ncan be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by\njoint tenancy."

In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the\nfollowing soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security\nproperties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and\nauthenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies\nsecurity in the label-based model.

It turns out that all the\ncollusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is\nreduced by a factor of more than 2.\n  Second, we study the statistical properties of the fingerprinting scheme, in\nparticular the average and variance of the accusations. We identify which\ncolluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a\ngaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the\naccusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error\nrate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for\nrigid proofs.\n  Combining the results of these two approaches, we show that the Tardos scheme\ncan be used with a code length approximately 5 times shorter than in the\noriginal construction."

We examine the expressive power of SIFs carefully. We show that\nSIFs cannot capture nondeducibility on strategies (NOS). We also prove that the\nset of security properties expressed with SIFs is not closed under conjunction,\nfrom which it follows that separability is strictly stronger than double\ngeneralized noninterference.

    "summary": "With the rapid spread of various mobile terminals in our society, the\nimportance of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in\nadversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure\npositioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric\nproperty of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics\nthat a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In\nparticular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio\nsignal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the\nchallenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct\nthe above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of\nbidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a\nmobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant\nprotected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and\nthe time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.\nOur proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile\nterminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to\nthe trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is\nfree from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations\nin the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the\nopen air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze\nthe security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in\ncomparison to previous proposals."

First, we present a protocol that\nimplements oblivious transfer from a weakened oblivious transfer called\nuniversal oblivious transfer, where one of the two players may get additional\ninformation. Our reduction is about twice as efficient as previous results.\n  Weak oblivious transfer is an even weaker form of oblivious transfer, where\nboth players may obtain additional information about the other player's input,\nand where the output can contain errors. We give a new, weaker definition of\nweak oblivious transfer, as well as new reductions with a more detailed\nanalysis.\n  Finally, we carry over our results to the computational setting and show how\na weak oblivious transfer that is sometimes incorrect and only mildly secure\nagainst computationally bounded adversaries can be strengthened."

In an effort to reduce the setup assumptions\nrequired for efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure\nagainst concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks, we consider a model, which we\ncall the Authenticated Public-Key (APK) model. The APK model seems to\nsignificantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted\nparty or honest execution of a centralized algorithm are required), and can be\nseen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from\n\\cite{CGGM,MR}, and a weaker variation of the registered public-key model used\nin \\cite{BCNP}. We then define and study man-in-the-middle attacks in the APK\nmodel. Our main result is a constant-round concurrent non-malleable\nzero-knowledge argument of knowledge for any polynomial-time relation\n(associated to a language in $\\mathcal{NP}$), under the (minimal) assumption of\nthe existence of a one-way function family. Furthermore,We show time-efficient\ninstantiations of our protocol based on known number-theoretic assumptions. We\nalso note a negative result with respect to further reducing the setup\nassumptions of our protocol to those in the (unauthenticated) BPK model, by\nshowing that concurrently non-malleable zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge\nin the BPK model are only possible for trivial languages."

Attackers can break the\nencryption by measuring the energy consumed in the working digital circuit. To\nprevent this type of attack, this paper proposes the use of reversible logic\nfor designing the ALU of a cryptosystem. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate\nzero energy. Thus, it would be of great significance to apply reversible logic\nto designing secure cryptosystems. As far as is known, this is the first\nattempt to apply reversible logic to developing secure cryptosystems. In a\nprototype of a reversible ALU for a crypto-processor, reversible designs of\nadders and Montgomery multipliers are presented. The reversible designs of a\ncarry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are\npresented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the\nTSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to\ndesign the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential\ncircuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to\ndesign a reversible modulo multiplier.

    "summary": "We present a method to secure the complete path between a server and the\nlocal human user at a network node. This is useful for scenarios like internet\nbanking, electronic signatures, or online voting. Protection of input\nauthenticity and output integrity and authenticity is accomplished by a\ncombination of traditional and novel technologies, e.g., SSL, ActiveX, and\nDirectX. Our approach does not require administrative privileges to deploy and\nis hence suitable for consumer applications. Results are based on the\nimplementation of a proof-of-concept application for the Windows platform."

The advantage being that an automated adversary is not\neffective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper\nextends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we\nanalyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the\nworkload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on\ntextual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of\nautomated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real\nhuman users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and\ngive some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the\nresults. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the\nrelationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human\nidentification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably\n``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model."

We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular\nof anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for\ninstance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the\nparties should be considered invisible to the adversary.\n  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which\nbetter model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their\ndecision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the\nadversary.\n  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible\nschedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are\nindependent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical\ncases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is\npossible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary\n`noticing'."

All protocols assume\npairwise authentic private channels and a broadcast channel (in a single case,\nwe require a simultaneous broadcast channel). We give protocols for veto, vote,\nanonymous bit transmission, collision detection, notification and anonymous\nmessage transmission. Not assuming an honest majority, in most cases, a single\ncorrupt participant can make the protocol abort. All protocols achieve\nfunctionality never obtained before without the use of either computational\nassumptions or of an honest majority."

We give algorithms for the problem (we call the\nMSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give\nvarious attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed.\nOne of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and\ntime complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case\nusing a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe\nO(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),\nwhere the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,\nXSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit. The above shows the\nAAGL protocol is potentially not significantly more secure as using key\nagreement protocols based on the conjugacy problem such as the AAG\n(Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld) protocol because both protocols can be broken with\ncomplexity which do not significantly differ.

In this exertion, an\nimproved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation\nof this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations\nof a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no\nexploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that\nthe input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between\nthe throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be\nviewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented\nmicro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed\nusing five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message\nalignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption\nmodule. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation\nresults. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and\nrouting reports, and finally the floor plan. Moreover, a detailed comparison\nwith other FPGA implementations is made available and discussed."

We implemented a\nhardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication in extended Galois fields\n(GF) applying Karatsuba's method iteratively. With this approach the area\nconsumption is reduced to 2.1 mm^2 in comparison to. 6.2 mm^2 for the standard\napplication of Karatsuba's method i.e. for recursive application. Our approach\nalso reduces the energy consumption to 60 per cent of the original approach.\nThe price we have to pay for these achievement is the increased execution time.\nIn our implementation a polynomial multiplication takes 3 clock cycles whereas\nthe recurisve Karatsuba approach needs only one clock cycle.

The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these\ntwo sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and\nnothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain\napplications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that\nreports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a\nprivate matching protocol is called \\emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance,\nwhen elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.\n  We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment.\nElements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show\nthat the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect.\nSubsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first,\nsimple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \\binom{T}{t} (T\n\\log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message\ncomplexity of $O(n T (\\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor\ntime complexity. Additionally, we present protocols based on the computation of\nthe Hamming distance and on oblivious transfer, that have different, sometimes\nmore efficient, performance characteristics."

    "summary": "Anonymization is the process of removing or hiding sensitive information in\nlogs. Anonymization allows organizations to share network logs while not\nexposing sensitive information. However, there is an inherent trade off between\nthe amount of information revealed in the log and the usefulness of the log to\nthe client (the utility of a log). There are many anonymization techniques, and\nthere are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to\nanonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with\nvarying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of\ndifferent anonymization policies on logs. We provide an empirical analysis of\nthe effect of varying anonymization policies by looking at the number of alerts\ngenerated by an Intrusion Detection System. This is the first work to\nthoroughly evaluate the effect of single field anonymization policies on a data\nset. Our main contributions are to determine a set of fields that have a large\nimpact on the utility of a log."

    "summary": "The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by\nSteinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be\nused as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional\nfunctionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature\nto any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message\nwas indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We\npropose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our\nfirst scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be\nanalyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery\nassuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the\nknowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the\nBoneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle\nmodel, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman\nproblem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained\ncomputation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are\npairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user\nsetting proposed by Desmedt in 2003."

The semi-trusted\nproxy does not learn either party's signing key and cannot sign arbitrary\nmessages on behalf of Alice or Bob. At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger\nrevisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and\nefficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open\nthe problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is\nable to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated\nseveral times.\n  This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago,\nand shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We\ndescribe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the\nAteniese-Hohenberger model. The same technique also yields a similar\nconstruction in the standard model (i.e. without relying on random oracles).\nBoth schemes are efficient and require newly defined -- but falsifiable --\nDiffie-Hellman-like assumptions in bilinear groups."

    "summary": "The security of wireless sensor networks is an active topic of research where\nboth symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography issues have been studied. Due to\ntheir computational feasibility on typical sensor nodes, symmetric key\nalgorithms that use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages have been\nintensively studied and perfectly deployed in such environment. Because of the\nwireless sensor's limited infrastructure, the bottleneck challenge for\ndeploying these algorithms is the key distribution. For the same reason of\nresources restriction, key distribution mechanisms which are used in\ntraditional wireless networks are not efficient for sensor networks.\n  To overcome the key distribution problem, several key pre-distribution\nalgorithms and techniques that assign keys or keying material for the networks\nnodes in an offline phase have been introduced recently. In this paper, we\nintroduce a supplemental distribution technique based on the communication\npattern and deployment knowledge modeling. Our technique is based on the\nhierarchical grid deployment. For granting a proportional security level with\nnumber of dependent sensors, we use different polynomials in different orders\nwith different weights. In seek of our proposed work's value, we provide a\ndetailed analysis on the used resources, resulting security, resiliency, and\nconnectivity compared with other related works."

    "summary": "In discrete logarithm based cryptography, a method by Pohlig and Hellman\nallows solving the discrete logarithm problem efficiently if the group order is\nknown and has no large prime factors. The consequence is that such groups are\navoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on\ncyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be\nadapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain\ninfrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result\nby M\\\"uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from\nhyperelliptic function fields.\n  We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic\ninfrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from\ncertain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain\ncyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the\nPohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a\ncomputationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an\nalgorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain\nrequirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether\nthe Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number\nfields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic\ninfrastructures."

    "summary": "Recent emergence of electronic culture uplifts healthcare facilities to a new\nera with the aid of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. Due to the\nsensitiveness of medical data, austere privacy and security are inevitable for\nall parts of healthcare systems. However, the constantly evolving nature and\nconstrained resources of sensors in WSN inflict unavailability of a lucid line\nof defense to ensure perfect security. In order to provide holistic security,\nprotections must be incorporated in every component of healthcare sensor\nnetworks. This paper proposes an efficient security scheme for healthcare\napplications of WSN which uses the notion of public key cryptosystem. Our\nentire security scheme comprises basically of two parts; a key handshaking\nscheme based on simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key\nby a receiver node for a particular sender in the network. Our architecture\nallows both base station to node or node to base station secure communications,\nand node-to-node secure communications.

    "summary": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of\nthe future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election\nprocess making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote\nvoting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account\nsusceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most\nthe research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site\nelectronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they\ncannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform\nproblem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful.\nThis paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic\nencryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques\nrecommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol\ntries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible\nfor manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper\nballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations\n(lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes,\nis performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme\nis characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the\nserver side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the\nvoter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability."

We\ncapture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \\emph{White-Box\nProperty (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the\nWBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a\n\\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an\nobfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak\nsome ``useless'' non-black-box information.\n  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an\nobfuscation (under \\emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every\nspecification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a\n\\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply\nthat under \\emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We\nthen show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist\n(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.\n  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a\nnon-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain\nspecification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but\napproximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.\n  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between\n``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information."

All protocols have polynomial complexity\nand require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Our first\nprotocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to\ncompute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional, but any voter can\ncause the protocol to fail, in which case information about the tally may\nnevertheless transpire. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which\nallow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction\nand limiting it to be only between voters and authorities and among the\nauthorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the\nauthorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is\nunconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter\ncan cause the protocol to fail. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against\ncorrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to\nrevoke incorrect votes. We also discuss the implementation of a simultaneous\nbroadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding\nversions of our protocols achieving everlasting security."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of building robust fuzzy extractors, which allow two\nparties holding similar random variables W, W' to agree on a secret key R in\nthe presence of an active adversary. Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by\nDodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P,\nwhich can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the\nother. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in\ntime (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an\nadditional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the\nadversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors\nsecure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.\n  We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts\na shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and\nsecurity parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W. The\npreviously best known result, also of Dodis et al., extracted up to (2m-n)/3\nbits (depending on the same parameters)."

Goyal proposed two constructions: the\nfirst one is efficient but can only trace well-formed decryption keys to their\nsource; the second one allows tracing obfuscated decryption boxes in a model\n(called weak black-box model) where cheating authorities have no decryption\noracle. The latter scheme is unfortunately far less efficient in terms of\ndecryption cost and ciphertext size. In this work, we propose a new\nconstruction that combines the efficiency of Goyal's first proposal with a very\nsimple weak black-box tracing mechanism.

Our public key algorithm is a\nbijective mapping, it does not perform message expansions and can be used both\nfor encryption and signatures. The public key consist of n quadratic\npolynomials with n variables where n=140, 160, ... . A particular\ncharacteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly\nparallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric\nblock cipher - the reason for the phrase \"A Public Key Block Cipher\" in the\ntitle of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the\nalgorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo\n-- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores\nand OpenMP 2.0 library. However, implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA that is\nrunning on 249.4 MHz it achieves decryption throughput of 399 Mbps, and\nimplemented on four Xilinx Virtex-5 chips that are running on 276.7 MHz it\nachieves encryption throughput of 44.27 Gbps.

A\nlarge class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator\ncan be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol\nanalysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very\nefficient in the XOR-free case.

    "summary": "Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This\nmakes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations,\ninto an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric\nstudies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse\nselection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were\nfound among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those\nwithout. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust\nauthorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics\nsuggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if\ntrust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of\ntrust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to\npower-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust.\nThe evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are\nknown to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive\nattacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust\nbuilding, and suggest some ideas for exploration."

Our\nanalysis shows some limitations of the FS scheme in term of its storage\nrequirements guaranteeing a reasonable privacy standard and the high\ncomputation as well. On the other hand, we introduce a robust definition of\nprivacy that considers the average case privacy and motivates the study of a\nweakness in the structure of FS (i.e., fake transactions filtering). In order\nto overcome this limit, we introduce a hybrid scheme that considers both\nprivacy and resources guidelines.

    "summary": "Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the\npractice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality\nillegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of\nobscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and\nusability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool\nJDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using\nvarious array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array\nfolding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system\nobfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code\nthat is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number\nof experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our\ntool."

    "summary": "Chaotic cryptography is based on the properties of chaos as source of\nentropy. Many different schemes have been proposed to take advantage of those\nproperties and to design new strategies to encrypt information. However, the\nright and efficient use of chaos in the context of cryptography requires a\nthorough knowledge about the dynamics of the selected chaotic system. Indeed,\nif the final encryption system reveals enough information about the underlying\nchaotic system it could be possible for a cryptanalyst to get the key, part of\nthe key or some information somehow equivalent to the key just analyzing those\ndynamical properties leaked by the cryptosystem. This paper shows what those\ndynamical properties are and how a cryptanalyst can use them to prove the\ninadequacy of an encryption system for the secure exchange of information. This\nstudy is performed through the introduction of a series of mathematical tools\nwhich should be the basic framework of cryptanalysis in the context of digital\nchaos-based cryptography."

The attack is described initially for recovering $\\lfloor\nlog_2(96) \\rfloor=6$ bits of the secret value $ID$, a result that by itself\nallows to mount traceability attacks on any given tag. However, the proposed\nscheme can be extended to obtain any amount of bits of the secret $ID$,\nprovided a sufficiently large number of successful consecutive sessions are\neavesdropped. We also present results on the attack's efficiency, and some\nideas to secure this version of the SASI protocol."

More precisely, we show that any 3-multiplicative\nLSSS is a strongly multiplicative LSSS, but the converse is not true; and that\nany strongly multiplicative LSSS can be efficiently converted into a\n3-multiplicative LSSS. Furthermore, we apply 3-multiplicative LSSS to the\ncomputation of unbounded fan-in multiplication, which reduces its round\ncomplexity to four (from five of the previous protocol based on strongly\nmultiplicative LSSS). We also give two constructions of 3-multiplicative LSSS\nfrom Reed-Muller codes and algebraic geometric codes.

    "summary": "Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of\nHarvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors.\nMica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets.\nStack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then\nexecute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code\ninjection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote\ncode injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program\nvulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory\nof an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that\npresents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only\nsucceeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting\npermanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the\ntarget sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that\ncan propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor\nbotnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented\nprogramming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and\nsuggest some counter-measures."

The objective of this paper is to\ndefine a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers\nrespectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The first abstraction\nlayer remains specific to a platform and a language. This first layer\ninterprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies\nthese operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in\nthe malware lifecycle. The second detection layer remains generic and is\ntotally interoperable between the different abstraction components. This layer\nrelies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are\nused for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow).\nTo feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two\ndifferent abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native\ncode and one processing the VBScript interpreted language. The different\nexperimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for\nscript files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process\ntraces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by\nmore sophisticated collection tools."

But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes,\nthese viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is\nthat Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New\nmodels have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but\nloosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a\nunified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the\nJoin-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the\nfundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for\ninteractions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more\ncomplex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly\nmodeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of\nundecidability and isolation still hold. However the process-based model has\npermitted to establish new results: identification of fragments from the\nJoin-Calculus where malware detection becomes decidable, formal definition of\nthe non-infection property, approximate solutions to restrict malware\npropagation."

    "summary": "We consider repeated communication sessions between a RFID Tag (e.g., Radio\nFrequency Identification, RFID Tag) and a RFID Verifier. A proactive\ninformation theoretic security scheme is proposed. The scheme is based on the\nassumption that the information exchanged during at least one of every n\nsuccessive communication sessions is not exposed to an adversary. The Tag and\nthe Verifier maintain a vector of n entries that is repeatedly refreshed by\npairwise xoring entries, with a new vector of n entries that is randomly chosen\nby the Tag and sent to the Verifier as a part of each communication session.\nThe general case in which the adversary does not listen in k > 0 sessions among\nany n successive communication sessions is also considered. A lower bound of\nn(k+1) for the number of random numbers used during any n successive\ncommunication sessions is proven. In other words, we prove that an algorithm\nmust use at least n(k+1) new random numbers during any n successive\ncommunication sessions. Then a randomized scheme that uses only O(n log n) new\nrandom numbers is presented. A computational secure scheme which is based on\nthe information theoretic secure scheme is used to ensure that even in the case\nthat the adversary listens in all the information exchanges, the communication\nbetween the Tag and the Verifier is secure."

    "summary": "Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the\npractice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality\nillegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more\namenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such\nas decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied\nform called byte codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java\nclass files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two\nlevel obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it\nmore resilient to reverse engineering attacks . But source code obfuscation is\nmuch more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope\nof the different variables used in the program and only very little progress\nhas been made on this front. We in this paper are proposing a framework named\nJConstHide for hiding constants, especially integers in the java source codes,\nto defeat reverse engineering through decompilation. To the best of our\nknowledge, no data hiding software are available for java source code constant\nhiding."

The main idea of this algorithm might at first seem\ncounter-intuitive--we have the participants check each other's work. A naive\nimplementation of this approach would, of course, be susceptible to collusion\nattacks, but we show that by, adapting efficient solutions to the parallel\nprocessor diagnosis problem, we can tolerate collusions of lazy cheaters, even\nif the number of such cheaters is a fraction of the total number of\nparticipants.

Fortunately, ontology defines a vocabulary.\nWe thus propose a new agent communication layer and present the web ontology\nlanguage (OWL)-based operational ontologies that provides a declarative\ndescription. It can be accessed by various engines to facilitate agent\ncommunication. Further, in our operational ontologies, we define the mental\nattitudes of agents that can be shared among other agents. Our architecture\nenhanced the 3APL agent platform, and it is implemented as an agent\ncommunication framework. Finally, we extended the framework to be compatible\nwith the web ontology language for service (OWL-S), and then develop a movie\nrecommendation system with four OWL-S semantic web services on the framework.\nThe benefits of this work are: 1) dynamic web service coordination, 2)\nontological reasoning through uniform representation, namely, the declarative\ndescription, and 3) easy reuse and extension of both ontology and engine\nthrough extending ontology."

    "summary": "With the evolution of the Internet, multicast communications seem\nparticularly well adapted for large scale commercial distribution applications,\nfor example, the pay TV channels and secure videoconferencing. Key management\nfor multicast remains an open topic in secure Communications today. Key\nmanagement mainly has to do with the distribution and update of keying material\nduring the group life. Several key tree based approach has been proposed by\nvarious authors to create and distribute the multicast group key in effective\nmanner. There are different key management algorithms that facilitate efficient\ndistribution and rekeying of the group key. These protocols normally add\ncommunication overhead as well as computation overhead at the group key\ncontroller and at the group members. This paper explores the various algorithms\nalong with the performances and derives an improved method."

    "summary": "Memory corruption attacks remain the primary threat for computer security.\nInformation flow tracking or taint analysis has been proven to be effective\nagainst most memory corruption attacks. However, there are two shortcomings\nwith current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause\napplication slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second,\nthese techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do\nnot overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite\ncritical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to\naddress these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique\nthat uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects.\nWe propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by\nuntrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We\nperformed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it\ncan detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string\nattacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known\napproaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not\nrequire the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance\noverhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application\nslowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing\napproaches. Finally, since our approach performs run-time binary\ninstrumentation, it is easier to integrate it with existing applications and\nsystems."

    "summary": "The vast majority of RFID authentication protocols assume the proximity\nbetween readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel.\nHowever, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag)\nand the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover\nis in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in\nwhich scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included.\nDistance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder\nrelay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but\nvulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of\nthem. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with\nthe objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag\ncomputational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this\nprotocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an\nadversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack\nis very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s\nprotocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating\nprotocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient\nschemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and\ninspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously."

These\nprotocols can be easily adapted to the personal entropy setting, where a user\ncan recover a password only if he can answer a large enough subset of personal\nquestions.\n  We introduce client-server password recovery methods, in which the recovery\ndata are stored at the server, and the recovery procedures are integrated into\nthe login procedures. These methods apply to two of the most common types of\npassword based authentication systems. The security of these solutions is\nsignificantly better than the security of presently proposed password recovery\nschemes.

    "summary": "Random number generation is a fundamental security primitive for RFID\ndevices. However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the\ncapacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must\nbe taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the\nimplementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag,\nwhich is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By\nrelating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication\nprotocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness\ntechniques on resource constrained devices."

    "summary": "Today, Internet becomes the essential part of our lives. Over 90 percent of\nthe ecommerce is developed on the Internet. A security algorithm became very\nnecessary for producer client transactions assurance and the financial\napplications safety. The rsa algorithm applicability derives from algorithm\nproperties like confidentiality, safe authentication, data safety and integrity\non the internet. Thus, this kind of networks can have a more easy utilization\nby practical accessing from short, medium, even long distance and from\ndifferent public places. Rsa encryption in the client side is relatively cheap,\nwhereas, the corresponding decryption in the server side is expensive because\nits private exponent is much larger. Thus ssl tls servers become swamped to\nperform public key decryption operations when the simultaneous requests\nincrease quickly .The batch rsa method is useful for such highly loaded web\nserver .In our proposed algorithm by reducing the response time and clients\ntolerable waiting time an improvement in performance of ssl tls servers can be\ndone. The proposed algorithm should provide the reasonable response time and\noptimizes server performance significantly. At Encryption side, to withstand\nmany attacks like brute force attack, subtle attack etc. we also adapted a\nparameter generation method, which sieve all the parameters strictly, and\nfilter out every insecure parameter."

    "summary": "Many basic key distribution schemes specifically tuned to wireless sensor\nnetworks have been proposed in the literature. Recently, several researchers\nhave proposed schemes in which they have used group-based deployment models and\nassumed predeployment knowledge of the expected locations of nodes. They have\nshown that these schemes achieve better performance than the basic schemes, in\nterms of connectivity, resilience against node capture and storage\nrequirements. But in many situations expected locations of nodes are not\navailable. In this paper we propose a solution which uses the basic scheme, but\ndoes not use group-based deployment model and predeployment knowledge of the\nlocations of nodes, and yet performs better than schemes which make the\naforementioned assumptions.\n  In our scheme, groups are formed after deployment of sensor nodes, on the\nbasis of their physical locations, and the nodes sample keys from disjoint key\npools. Compromise of a node affects secure links with other nodes that are part\nof its group only. Because of this reason, our scheme performs better than the\nbasic schemes and the schemes using predeployment knowledge, in terms of\nconnectivity, storage requirement, and security. Moreover, the post-deployment\nkey generation process completes sooner than in schemes like LEAP+."

EFS supports secure storage at the system level through a\nstandard UNIX file system interface to encrypted files. User can associate a\ncryptographic key with the directories they wish to protect. Files in these\ndirectories (as well as their pathname components) are transparently encrypted\nand decrypted with the specified key without further user intervention; clear\ntext is never stored on a disk or sent to a remote file server. EFS can use any\navailable file system for its underlying storage without modifications,\nincluding remote file servers such as NFS. System management functions, such as\nfile backup, work in a normal manner and without knowledge of the key.\nPerformance is an important factor to users since encryption can be time\nconsuming. This paper describes the design and implementation of EFS in user\nspace using faster cryptographic algorithms on UNIX Operating system.\nImplementing EFS in user space makes it portable and flexible; Kernel size will\nalso not increase resulting in more reliable & efficient Operating System.\nEncryption techniques for file system level encryption are described, and\ngeneral issues of cryptographic system interfaces to support routine secure\ncomputing are discussed."

One of the consequences is that many people avoid e-commerce\nentirely due to privacy and security concerns. The solution is to perform\nauthentication without identification. In fact, all on-line actions should be\nas anonymous as possible, for this is the only way to guarantee security for\nthe overall system. A credential system is a system in which users can obtain\ncredentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials.\nSuch a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user\ncannot be linked.

Although a number of\nprotocols for group key agreement have been proposed, most of them are not\napplicable in heterogeneous environment where a number of computationally\nlimited nodes coexist with one or more computationally efficient nodes. Among\nthe few existing protocols, where some fail to satisfy the key agreement\nproperties, some are unable to handle the agreement for dynamic group.

The protocol ensures\nboth communication and computation efficiency by shifting the major computation\nload on powerful users, achieves true contributory key agreement property and\ndynamic handling of user join and leave. The security of the protocol has been\nanalyzed under formal model. The comparison result shows considerable\nimprovement in protocol efficiency compared to the existing ones."

However existing\npossibilities for state space explosion still hinder analyses of complex\nprotocols and protocol configurations. Message Inspection, is a technique that\ndelimits the branching of the state space due to the intruder model without\nexcluding possible attacks. In a preliminary simulation, the intruder model\ntags the eavesdropped messages with specific metadata that enable validation of\nfeasibility of possible attack actions. The Message Inspection algorithm then\ndecides based on these metadata, which attacks will certainly fail according to\nknown security principles. Thus, it is a priori known that i.e. an encryption\nscheme attack cannot succeed if the intruder does not posses the right key in\nhis knowledge. The simulation terminates with a report of the attack actions\nthat can be safely removed, resulting in a model with a reduced state space."

    "summary": "Important document are being kept encrypted in remote servers. In order to\nretrieve these encrypted data, efficient search methods needed to enable the\nretrieval of the document without knowing the content of the documents In this\npaper a technique called a global heuristic search on encrypted data (GHSED)\ntechnique will be described for search in an encrypted files using public key\nencryption stored on an untrusted server and retrieve the files that satisfy a\ncertain search pattern without revealing any information about the original\nfiles. GHSED technique would satisfy the following: (1) Provably secure, the\nuntrusted server cannot learn anything about the plaintext given only the\ncipher text. (2) Provide controlled searching, so that the untrusted server\ncannot search for a word without the user's authorization. (3) Support hidden\nqueries, so that the user may ask the untrusted server to search for a secret\nword without revealing the word to the server. (4) Support query isolation, so\nthe untrusted server learns nothing more than the search result about the\nplaintext."

This paper studies and takes a\ncareful look at this issue from the angle of philosophy and cognitive science.\nWe have studied the process of passwords to rank its strengths and weaknesses\nin order to establish a quality metric for passwords. Finally we related the\nprocess to human senses which enables us to propose a constitutional scheme for\nthe process of password. The basic proposition is to exploit relationship\nbetween human senses and password to ensure improvement in authentication while\nkeeping it an enjoyable activity."

    "summary": "This paper addresses efficient hardware/software implementation approaches\nfor the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and describes the design\nand performance testing algorithm for embedded system. Also, with the spread of\nreconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array) embedded\ncryptographic hardware became cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is worthy to\nnote that nowadays, even hardwired cryptographic algorithms are not so safe.\n  From another side, the self-reconfiguring platform is reported that enables\nan FPGA to dynamically reconfigure itself under the control of an embedded\nmicroprocessor. Hardware acceleration significantly increases the performance\nof embedded systems built on programmable logic. Allowing a FPGA-based\nMicroBlaze processor to self-select the coprocessors uses can help reduce area\nrequirements and increase a system's versatility. The architecture proposed in\nthis paper is an optimal hardware implementation algorithm and takes dynamic\npartially reconfigurable of FPGA. This implementation is good solution to\npreserve confidentiality and accessibility to the information in the numeric\ncommunication."

    "summary": "Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are widely used over the Internet as they\nprovide a simple and elegant way of interaction between the client and the\nserver. This paper proposes a solution for securing the remote procedure calls\n(RPC) by tunneling it through HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure\nSocket Layer). RPC over HTTP actually uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)\nprotocol as a transport for the traffic. SSL mandates that the server\nauthenticates itself to the client using a digital certificate (and associated\nprivate key). SSL is normally configured to encrypt traffic before transmitting\nit between the server and client and vice versa."

    "summary": "In many of the cryptography applications like password or IP address\nencryption schemes, symmetric cryptography is useful. In these relatively\nsimpler applications of cryptography, asymmetric cryptography is difficult to\njustify on account of the computational and implementation complexities\nassociated with asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric schemes make use of a single\nshared key known only between the two communicating hosts. This shared key is\nused both for the encryption as well as the decryption of data. This key has to\nbe small in size besides being a subset of a potentially large keyspace making\nit convenient for the communicating hosts while at the same time making\ncryptanalysis difficult for the potential attackers. In the present work, an\nabstract Rossler nonlinear dynamical machine has been described first. The\nRossler system exhibits chaotic dynamics for certain values of system\nparameters and initial conditions. The chaotic dynamics of the Rossler system\nwith its apparently erratic and irregular characteristics and extreme\nsensitivity to the initial conditions has been used for the design of the\ncryptographic key in an attempt to increase the confusion and the challenge for\nthe potential attackers."

    "summary": "Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of autonomous nodes or\nterminals which communicate with each other by forming a multi-hop radio\nnetwork and maintaining connectivity in a decentralized manner. The\nconventional security solutions to provide key management through accessing\ntrusted authorities or centralized servers are infeasible for this new\nenvironment since mobile ad hoc networks are characterized by the absence of\nany infrastructure, frequent mobility, and wireless links. We propose a\nhierarchical group key management scheme that is hierarchical and fully\ndistributed with no central authority and uses a simple rekeying procedure\nwhich is suitable for large and high mobility mobile ad hoc networks. The\nrekeying procedure requires only one round in our scheme and Chinese Remainder\nTheorem Diffie Hellman Group Diffie Hellmann and Burmester and Desmedt it is a\nconstant 3 whereas in other schemes such as Distributed Logical Key Hierarchy\nand Distributed One Way Function Trees, it depends on the number of members. We\nreduce the energy consumption during communication of the keying materials by\nreducing the number of bits in the rekeying message. We show through analysis\nand simulations that our scheme has less computation, communication and energy\nconsumption compared to the existing schemes."

    "summary": "In 2006, Peris-Lopez et al. [1, 2, 3] initiated the design of\nultralightweight RFID protocols -with the UMAP family of protocols- involving\nonly simple bitwise logical or arithmetic operations such as bitwise XOR, OR,\nAND, and addition. This combination of operations was revealed later to be\ninsufficient for security. Then, Chien et al. proposed the SASI protocol [4]\nwith the aim of offering better security, by adding the bitwise rotation to the\nset of supported operations. The SASI protocol represented a milestone in the\ndesign of ultralightweight protocols, although certain attacks have been\npublished against this scheme [5, 6, 7]. In 2008, a new protocol, named\nGossamer [8], was proposed that can be considered a further development of both\nthe UMAP family and SASI. Although no attacks have been published against\nGossamer, Lee et al. [9] have recently published an alternative scheme that is\nhighly reminiscent of SASI. In this paper, we show that Lee et al.'s scheme\nfails short of many of its security objectives, being vulnerable to several\nimportant attacks like traceability, full disclosure, cloning and\ndesynchronization."
