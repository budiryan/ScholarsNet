    "summary": "We develop and analyze algorithms for dispersing a swarm of primitive robots\nin an unknown environment, R. The primary objective is to minimize the\nmakespan, that is, the time to fill the entire region. An environment is\ncomposed of pixels that form a connected subset of the integer grid.\n  There is at most one robot per pixel and robots move horizontally or\nvertically at unit speed. Robots enter R by means of k>=1 door pixels\n  Robots are primitive finite automata, only having local communication, local\nsensors, and a constant-sized memory.\n  We first give algorithms for the single-door case (i.e., k=1), analyzing the\nalgorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We prove that our algorithms\nhave optimal makespan 2A-1, where A is the area of R.\n  We next give an algorithm for the multi-door case (k>1), based on a\nwall-following version of the leader-follower strategy. We prove that our\nstrategy is O(log(k+1))-competitive, and that this bound is tight for our\nstrategy and other related strategies."

The hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixed points (stationary\nsolutions) in phase space are determined. Under suitable conditions, the\npresence of constant torques does not change the number of fixed points, and\npreserves the topology of orbits in their linear neighborhoods; two equivalent\ninvariant manifolds are observed, each corresponding to a saddle-center fixed\npoint."

    "summary": "Deterministic replay is a method for allowing complex multitasking real-time\nsystems to be debugged using standard interactive debuggers. Even though\nseveral replay techniques have been proposed for parallel, multi-tasking and\nreal-time systems, the solutions have so far lingered on a prototype academic\nlevel, with very little results to show from actual state-of-the-practice\ncommercial applications. This paper describes a major deterministic replay\ndebugging case study performed on a full-scale industrial robot control system,\nas well as a minor replay instrumentation case study performed on a military\naircraft radar system. In this article, we will show that replay debugging is\nfeasible in complex multi-million lines of code software projects running on\ntop of off-the-shelf real-time operating systems. Furthermore, we will discuss\nhow replay debugging can be introduced in existing systems without\nimpracticable analysis efforts. In addition, we will present benchmarking\nresults from both studies, indicating that the instrumentation overhead is\nacceptable and affordable."

    "summary": "Mobile robots have received a great deal of research in recent years. A\nsignificant amount of research has been published in many aspects related to\nmobile robots. Most of the research is devoted to design and develop some\ncontrol techniques for robot motion and path planning. A large number of\nresearchers have used kinematic models to develop motion control strategy for\nmobile robots. Their argument and assumption that these models are valid if the\nrobot has low speed, low acceleration and light load. However, dynamic\nmodelling of mobile robots is very important as they are designed to travel at\nhigher speed and perform heavy duty work. This paper presents and discusses a\nnew approach to develop a dynamic model and control strategy for wheeled mobile\nrobot which I modelled as a rigid body that roles on two wheels and a castor.\nThe motion control strategy consists of two levels. The first level is dealing\nwith the dynamic of the system and denoted as Low level controller. The second\nlevel is developed to take care of path planning and trajectory generation."

    "summary": "An adaptive Monte Carlo localization algorithm based on coevolution mechanism\nof ecological species is proposed. Samples are clustered into species, each of\nwhich represents a hypothesis of the robots pose. Since the coevolution between\nthe species ensures that the multiple distinct hypotheses can be tracked\nstably, the problem of premature convergence when using MCL in highly symmetric\nenvironments can be solved. And the sample size can be adjusted adaptively over\ntime according to the uncertainty of the robots pose by using the population\ngrowth model. In addition, by using the crossover and mutation operators in\nevolutionary computation, intra-species evolution can drive the samples move\ntowards the regions where the desired posterior density is large. So a small\nsize of samples can represent the desired density well enough to make precise\nlocalization. The new algorithm is termed coevolution based adaptive Monte\nCarlo localization (CEAMCL). Experiments have been carried out to prove the\nefficiency of the new localization algorithm."

The general decision-making model is based\non two critical factors in soccer games: the vertical distance to the goal line\nand the visual angle for the goalpost. We have used these two parameters to\nformalize the defensive and offensive decisions in RoboCup simulation and the\nresults mentioned above had been applied in NOVAURO, original name is UJDB, a\nRoboCup simulation team of Jiangsu University, whose decision-making model,\ncompared with that of Tsinghua University, the world champion team in 2001, is\na universal model and easier to be implemented."

    "summary": "The sewer inspection robot MAKRO is an autonomous multi-segment robot with\nworm-like shape driven by wheels. It is currently under development in the\nproject MAKRO-PLUS. The robot has to navigate autonomously within sewer\nsystems. Its first tasks will be to take water probes, analyze it onboard, and\nmeasure positions of manholes and pipes to detect polluted-loaded sewage and to\nimprove current maps of sewer systems. One of the challenging problems is the\ncontroller software, which should enable the robot to navigate in the sewer\nsystem and perform the inspection tasks autonomously, not inflicting any\nself-damage. This paper focuses on the route planning and replanning aspect of\nthe robot. The robots software has four different levels, of which the planning\nsystem is the highest level, and the remaining three are controller levels each\nwith a different degree of abstraction. The planner coordinates the sequence of\nactions that are to be successively executed by the robot."

Next, we\nsummarize original ideas on subsumption architecture implementation for a\nsix-legged robot, as presented by its inventor Rodney Brooks in 1980s. A\ncomparison is then made to a more recent example of a hexapod control\narchitecture based on subsumption.

By introducing a set of tasks\nto be completed by the team of vehicles and a task execution method for each\nvehicle, we decomposed the problem into a combinatorial component and a\ncontinuous component. The continuous component of the problem is captured by\ntask execution, and the combinatorial component is captured by task assignment.\nIn this paper, we present a solver for task assignment that generates\nnear-optimal assignments quickly and can be used in real-time applications. To\nmotivate our methods, we apply them to an adversarial game between two teams of\nvehicles. One team is governed by simple rules and the other by our algorithms.\nIn our study of this game we found phase transitions, showing that the task\nassignment problem is most difficult to solve when the capabilities of the\nadversaries are comparable.

Cybercars have already been put\ninto operation in Europe, and it seems that this approach could lead the way\ntowards full automation on most urban, and later interurban infrastructures.\nThe European project CyberCars has brought many improvements in the technology\nneeded to operate cybercars over the last three years.

    "summary": "Path planning and obstacle avoidance are the two major issues in any\nnavigation system. Wavefront propagation algorithm, as a good path planner, can\nbe used to determine an optimal path. Obstacle avoidance can be achieved using\npossibility theory. Combining these two functions enable a robot to\nautonomously navigate to its destination. This paper presents the approach and\nresults in implementing an autonomous navigation system for an indoor mobile\nrobot. The system developed is based on a laser sensor used to retrieve data to\nupdate a two dimensional world model of therobot environment. Waypoints in the\npath are incorporated into the obstacle avoidance. Features such as ageing of\nobjects and smooth motion planning are implemented to enhance efficiency and\nalso to cater for dynamic environments."

    "summary": "This paper investigates the problem of the dynamic balance control of\nmulti-arm free-floating space robot during capturing an active object in close\nproximity. The position and orientation of space base will be affected during\nthe operation of space manipulator because of the dynamics coupling between the\nmanipulator and space base. This dynamics coupling is unique characteristics of\nspace robot system. Such a disturbance will produce a serious impact between\nthe manipulator hand and the object. To ensure reliable and precise operation,\nwe propose to develop a space robot system consisting of two arms, with one arm\n(mission arm) for accomplishing the capture mission, and the other one (balance\narm) compensating for the disturbance of the base. We present the coordinated\ncontrol concept for balance of the attitude of the base using the balance arm.\nThe mission arm can move along the given trajectory to approach and capture the\ntarget with no considering the disturbance from the coupling of the base. We\nestablish a relationship between the motion of two arm that can realize the\nzeros reaction to the base. The simulation studies verified the validity and\nefficiency of the proposed control method."

Goals can be programmed. That is\nwhy living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this\npaper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed,\nbehaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We\nsuggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components\n(probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables\nwith nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a\nNormalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the\ncontribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group\nstates is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths\nbetween these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after\nadjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will\nnever involve chaos. We suggest the application of the model to operation of\nrobots or other devices in remote and/or dangerous places."

    "summary": "This paper presents a new concept of a mobile robot speed control by using\ntwo degree of freedom gear transmission. The developed intelligent speed\ncontroller utilizes a gear box which comprises of epicyclic gear train with two\ninputs, one coupled with the engine shaft and another with the shaft of a\nvariable speed dc motor. The net output speed is a combination of the two input\nspeeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.\nThis new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise\nan indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby\nreducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling. By\ngradually varying the speed of the dc motor a stepless transmission has been\nachieved. The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and\nreversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and\nengine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire\nvehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC\nmotor, utilizes the modern idea of hybrid vehicles. The new mobile robot speed\ncontroller is capable of driving the vehicle even in extreme case of IC engine\nfailure, for example, due to gas depletion."

In opposite to serial\nmanipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse\nkinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This\nproperty produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility\nin trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of\naspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on\nthe notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse\nkinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular\nassembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel\nmanipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle."

    "summary": "This paper focuses on the kinematic properties of a new\nthree-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by\nadding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by\nBajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the\ntwo actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture\nis hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel\nmanipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable\nsingularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]\nand [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic\narrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from\nrelatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is\nintrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are\nlocated on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In\naddition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator\nhas the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of\nthe \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the\ndifferent structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and\nmechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid\nmanipulators."

    "summary": "Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which\nmeans that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators\nand joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such\narchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high\nstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit\nthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and\nmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several\nadvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and\nhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the\nlinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia\neffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a\nparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further\nresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need\nto be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to\nthe description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the\nJacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:\nnext section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs\ncan be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented\nexisting PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool\nprototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper."

This categorization is based on the number of cusp points of\nquaternary, binary, generic and non-generic manipulators. It was found three\nsubsets of manipulators with 0, 2 or 4 cusp points and one homotopy class for\ngeneric quaternary manipulators. This classification allows us to define the\ndesign parameters for which the manipulator is cuspidal or not, i.e., for which\nthe manipulator can or cannot change posture without meeting a singularity,\nrespectively."

Two\nJacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and\nthe Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the \"inverse kinematics\" and\nthe \"direct kinematics\" matrices.

    "summary": "This paper investigates two situations in which the forward kinematics of\nplanar 3-RPR parallel manipulators degenerates. These situations have not been\naddressed before. The first degeneracy arises when the three input joint\nvariables r1, r2 and r3 satisfy a certain relationship. This degeneracy yields\na double root of the characteristic polynomial in t, which could be erroneously\ninterpreted as two coalesce assembly modes. But, unlike what arises in\nnon-degenerate cases, this double root yields two sets of solutions for the\nposition coordinates (x, y) of the platform. In the second situation, we show\nthat the forward kinematics degenerates over the whole joint space if the base\nand platform triangles are congruent and the platform triangle is rotated by\n180 deg about one of its sides. For these \"degenerate\" manipulators, which are\ndefined here for the first time, the forward kinematics is reduced to the\nsolution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a quadratics in sequence. Such\nmanipulators constitute, in turn, a new family of analytic planar manipulators\nthat would be more suitable for industrial applications."

In this paper we investigate the\nexistence of redundant isotropic architectures, which should add to the\ndexterity of the wrist under design by virtue of its extra degree of freedom.\nThe problem formulation, for, leads to a system of eight quadratic equations\nwith eight unknowns.

However, in order to be able to avoid\ndefinitively physical model, old support of the design, without loss of\ninformation, new tools must be available. Especially, a tool making it possible\nto check simply and quickly the maintainability of complex mechanical sets\nusing the numerical model is necessary. Since one decade, our team works on the\ncreation of tool for the generation and the analysis of trajectories of virtual\nmannequins. The simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by\nrobot-like simulation or by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents\nsome results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a\nmulti-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient\npath planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking\ninto account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to\nsolve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process\noptimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This\noperator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary\nagents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR\nto solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its\nenvironment on the basis of data resulting from motion capture system. An\napproach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the\nrealization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback. The result of\nthis work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to\nsimulate maintenability and mountability tasks."

The theory based on the study of Jacobian matrices allows us to\nexplain, for example, the singular configuration. However, in many cases, the\nphysical sense of such properties is difficult to explain to students. The aim\nof this article is to use haptic feedback to render to the user the\nsignification of different kinematic indices.

This transmission\nprovides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions\nand linear drives.

What isotropy brings about is robustness to manufacturing,\nassembly, and measurement errors, thereby guaranteeing a maximum orientation\naccuracy. In this paper we investigate the existence of redundant isotropic\narchitectures, which should add to the dexterity of the wrist under design by\nvirtue of its extra degree of freedom. The problem formulation leads to a\nsystem of eight quadratic equations with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of\nthis system is thus 2^8 = 256, its BKK bound being 192. However, the actual\nnumber of solutions is shown to be 32. We list all solutions of the foregoing\nalgebraic problem. All these solutions are real, but distinct solutions do not\nnecessarily lead to distinct manipulators. Upon discarding those algebraic\nsolutions that yield no new wrists, we end up with exactly eight distinct\narchitectures, the eight corresponding manipulators being displayed at their\nisotropic posture."

First, a compliant modeling of\nthe Orthoglide is conducted based on an existing method. Then stiffness matrix\nis symbolically computed. This allows one to easily study the influence of the\ngeometric design parameters on the matrix elements. Critical links are\ndisplayed. Cutting forces are then modeled so that static displacements of the\nOrthoglide tool during slot milling are symbolically computed. Influence of the\ngeometric design parameters on the static displacements is checked as well.\nOther machining operations can be modeled. This parametric stiffness analysis\ncan be applied to any parallel manipulator for which stiffness is a critical\nissue."

    "summary": "The paper addresses the geometric synthesis of Orthoglide-type mechanism, a\nfamily of 3-DOF parallel manipulators for rapid machining applications, which\ncombine advantages of both serial mechanisms and parallel kinematic\narchitectures. These manipulators possess quasi-isotropic kinematic\nperformances and are made up of three actuated fixed prismatic joints, which\nare mutually orthogonal and connected to a mobile platform via three\nparallelogram chains. The platform moves in the Cartesian space with fixed\norientation, similar to conventional XYZ-machine. Three strategies have been\nproposed to define the Orthoglide geometric parameters (manipulator link\nlengths and actuated joint limits) as functions of a cubic workspace size and\ndextrous properties expressed by bounds on the velocity transmission factors,\nmanipulability or the Jacobian condition number. Low inertia and intrinsic\nstiffness have been set as additional design goals expressed by the minimal\nlink length requirement. For each design strategy, analytical expressions for\ncomputing the Orthoglide parameters are proposed. It is showed that the\nproposed strategies yield Pareto-optimal solutions, which differ by the\nkinematic performances outside the prescribed Cartesian cube (but within the\nworkspace bounded by the actuated joint limits). The proposed technique is\nillustrated with numerical examples for the Orthoglide prototype design."

Thus, a differential vector method is used to study the\ninfluence of the dimensional and angular variations in the parts of the\nmanipulator on the position and orientation of the end-effector, and\nparticularly the influence of the variations in the parallelograms. It turns\nout that the kinematic isotropic configuration of the manipulator is the least\nsensitive one to its dimensional and angular variations.

A computer program is used to\nsolve the equilibrium conditions and then calculate the change in aerodynamics\nforces and moments due to the change in each degree of freedom and control\ninput. The detail derivation allows the comprehensive analysis of relative\ndominance of vehicle states and input variables to force and moment components.\nHence it facilitates the development of minimum complexity small scale\nhelicopter dynamics model."

    "summary": "A model helicopter is more difficult to control than its full scale\ncounterparts. This is due to its greater sensitivity to control inputs and\ndisturbances as well as higher bandwidth of dynamics. This works is focused on\ndesigning practical tracking controller for a small scale helicopter following\npredefined trajectories. A tracking controller based on optimal control theory\nis synthesized as part of the development of an autonomous helicopter. Some\nissues in regards to control constraints are addressed. The weighting between\nstate tracking performance and control power expenditure is analyzed. Overall\nperformance of the control design is evaluated based on its time domain\nhistories of trajectories as well as control inputs."

The micropump is composed of two\nlayers fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material. The first layer\nhas a rectangular channel and two valve seals. Three rectangular mini\nlightweight piezo-composite actuators are integrated in the second layer, and\nused as actuation parts. Two layers are bonded, and covered by two polymethyl\nmethacrylate (PMMA) plates, which help increase the stiffness of the micropump.\nA maximum flow rate of 900 mokroliter per min and a maximum backpressure of 1.8\nkPa are recorded when water is used as pump liquid. We measured the power\nconsumption of the micropump. The micropump is found to be a promising\ncandidate for bio-medical application due to its bio-compatibility,\nportability, bidirectionality, and simple effective design."

To\ndetermine dynamic yaw stability derivatives of the bird, the simulation of an\nunsteady flow with a bird model showing a harmonic motion is performed. The\nunsteady flow solution for each time step is obtained by solving unsteady Euler\nequations based on a finite volume approach for a smaller reduced frequency.\nThen, an evaluation of unsteady forces and moments for one cycle is conducted\nusing harmonic Fourier analysis.

The wavelet transform is employed to\nextract the learnable dynamics from measured output signal before it can be\nused to update the control profile. The wavelet transform is adopted to\ndecompose the original signal into many low-resolution signals that contain the\nlearnable and unlearnable parts. The desired control profile is then compared\nwith the learnable part of the transformed signal. Thus, the effects from\nunlearnable dynamics on the controlled system can be attenuated by a Fuzzy PD\nfeedback controller. As for the rules of Fuzzy PD controller in the feedback\nloop, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the inference rules of\noptimization. A proportional-valve controlled pneumatic cylinder actuator\nsystem is used as the control target for simulation. Simulation results have\nshown a much-improved positiontracking performance."

The coefficient of zonal\nharmonics J2 was induced into the gravity-gradient moment term that affects the\nsatellite attitude. The satellite's motion and attitude were then simulated in\nthe perturbed gravitational field by J2, with the variation of orbit's\neccentricity and inclination.

    "summary": "A mini scale helicopter exhibits not only increased sensitivity to control\ninputs and disturbances, but also higher bandwidth of its dynamics. These\nproperties make model helicopters, as a flying robot, more difficult to\ncontrol. The dynamics model accuracy will determine the performance of the\ndesigned controller. It is attractive in this regards to have a controller that\ncan accommodate the unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes and perform well in\nsuch situations. Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is chosen as the candidate to\nsynthesize such a controller due to its simplicity and convenience in\ndemonstrating integrated performance measures including equivalent time\nconstant, stability indices and robustness. In this study, CDM is implemented\nfor a design of multivariable controller for a small scale helicopter during\nhover and cruise flight. In the synthesis of MIMO CDM, good design common sense\nbased on hands-on experience is necessary. The low level controller algorithm\nis designed as part of hybrid supervisory control architecture to be\nimplemented on an onboard computer system. Its feasibility and performance are\nevaluated based on its robustness, desired time domain system responses and\ncompliance to hard-real time requirements."

The underwater robotics technology has enabled\nhuman to access the depth of the ocean to conduct environmental surveys,\nresources mapping as well as scientific and military missions. This capability\nis especially valuable for countries with major water or oceanic resources. As\nan archipelagic nation with more than 13,000 islands, Indonesia has one of the\nmost abundant living and non-organic oceanic resources. The needs for the\nmapping, exploration, and environmental preservation of the vast marine\nresources are therefore imperative. The challenge of the deep water exploration\nhas been the complex issues associated with hazardous and unstructured undersea\nand sea-bed environments. The paper reports the design, development and testing\nefforts of underwater vehicle that have been conducted at Institut Teknologi\nBandung.

As an\naerial vehicle with vertical take-off and landing capability, the helicopter\nspecifically poses a difficult problem of transition between forward flight and\nunstable hover and vice versa. The LPV control technique explicitly takes into\naccount the change in performance due to the real-time parameter variations.\nThe technique therefore theoretically guarantees the performance and robustness\nover the entire operating envelope. In this study, we investigate a new\napproach implementing model identification for use in the LPV control\nframework. The identification scheme employs recursive least square technique\nimplemented on the LPV system represented by dynamics of helicopter during a\ntransition. The airspeed as the scheduling of parameter trajectory is not\nassumed to vary slowly. The exclusion of slow parameter change requirement\nallows for the application of the algorithm for aggressive maneuvering\ncapability without the need of expensive computation.

    "summary": "The control of small-scale helicopter is a MIMO problem. To use of classical\ncontrol approach to formally solve a MIMO problem, one needs to come up with\nmultidimensional Root Locus diagram to tune the control parameters. The problem\nwith the required dimension of the RL diagram for MIMO design has forced the\ndesign procedure of classical approach to be conducted in cascaded multi-loop\nSISO system starting from the innermost loop outward. To implement this control\napproach for a helicopter, a pitch and roll attitude control system is often\nsubordinated to a, respectively, longitudinal and lateral velocity control\nsystem in a nested architecture. The requirement for this technique to work is\nthat the inner attitude control loop must have a higher bandwidth than the\nouter velocity control loop which is not the case for high performance mini\nhelicopter. To address the above problems, an algebraic design approach is\nproposed in this work. The designed control using s-CDM approach is\ndemonstrated for hovering control of small-scale helicopter simultaneously\nsubjected to plant parameter uncertainties and wind disturbances."

    "summary": "In this paper, our focus is on certain applications for mobile robotic\nnetworks, where reconfiguration is driven by factors intrinsic to the network\nrather than changes in the external environment. In particular, we study a\nversion of the coverage problem useful for surveillance applications, where the\nobjective is to position the robots in order to minimize the average distance\nfrom a random point in a given environment to the closest robot. This problem\nhas been well-studied for omni-directional robots and it is shown that optimal\nconfiguration for the network is a centroidal Voronoi configuration and that\nthe coverage cost belongs to $\\Theta(m^{-1/2})$, where $m$ is the number of\nrobots in the network. In this paper, we study this problem for more realistic\nmodels of robots, namely the double integrator (DI) model and the differential\ndrive (DD) model. We observe that the introduction of these motion constraints\nin the algorithm design problem gives rise to an interesting behavior. For a\n\\emph{sparser} network, the optimal algorithm for these models of robots mimics\nthat for omni-directional robots. We propose novel algorithms whose\nperformances are within a constant factor of the optimal asymptotically (i.e.,\nas $m \\to +\\infty$). In particular, we prove that the coverage cost for the DI\nand DD models of robots is of order $m^{-1/3}$. Additionally, we show that, as\nthe network grows, these novel algorithms outperform the conventional\nalgorithm; hence necessitating a reconfiguration in the network in order to\nmaintain optimal quality of service."

    "summary": "This paper studies the kinematic geometry of general 3-RPR planar parallel\nrobots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have\nsimple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore,\ntheir kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel\nrobot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic\nmodel, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots\nare determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is\ngeometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic\nmodel. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of\nfreedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted.\nFinally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations\nperformed on an actual robot prototype are presented."

A drawback of parallel mechanisms is the non\nhomogeneity of kinetostatic performance within their workspace. The common\napproach to solve this problem is the introduction of actuation redundancy,\nthat involves force control algorithms. Another approach, highlighted in this\npaper, is to select the actuated joint in each limb with regard to the pose of\nthe end-effector. First, the architecture of the mechanism and two kinetostatic\nperformance indices are described. Then, the actuating modes of the mechanism\nare compared."

    "summary": "Muscle fatigue is defined as the point at which the muscle is no longer able\nto sustain the required force or work output level. The overexertion of muscle\nforce and muscle fatigue can induce acute pain and chronic pain in human body.\nWhen muscle fatigue is accumulated, the functional disability can be resulted\nas musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). There are several posture exposure analysis\nmethods useful for rating the MSD risks, but they are mainly based on static\npostures. Even in some fatigue evaluation methods, muscle fatigue evaluation is\nonly available for static postures, but not suitable for dynamic working\nprocess. Meanwhile, some existing muscle fatigue models based on physiological\nmodels cannot be easily used in industrial ergonomic evaluations. The external\ndynamic load is definitely the most important factor resulting muscle fatigue,\nthus we propose a new fatigue model under a framework for evaluating fatigue in\ndynamic working processes. Under this framework, virtual reality system is\ntaken to generate virtual working environment, which can be interacted with the\nwork with haptic interfaces and optical motion capture system. The motion\ninformation and load information are collected and further processed to\nevaluate the overall work load of the worker based on dynamic muscle fatigue\nmodels and other work evaluation criterions and to give new information to\ncharacterize the penibility of the task in design process."

However, in order to be able to avoid definitively physical\nmodel without loss of information, new tools must be available. Especially, a\ntool making it possible to check simply and quickly the maintainability of\ncomplex mechanical sets using the numerical model is necessary. Since one\ndecade, the MCM team of IRCCyN works on the creation of tools for the\ngeneration and the analysis of trajectories of virtual mannequins. The\nsimulation of human tasks can be carried out either by robot-like simulation or\nby simulation by motion capture. This paper presents some results on the both\ntwo methods. The first method is based on a multi-agent system and on a digital\nmock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin or a\nrobot for access and visibility task taking into account ergonomic constraints\nor joint limits. The human operator is integrated in the process optimisation\nto contribute to a global perception of the environment. This operator\ncooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary agents. In\nthe second method, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR to solve the constraints\nrelated to the evolution of human virtual in its environment on the basis of\ndata resulting from motion capture system.

The purpose of this study is to review current urologic\nrobots and present future development directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Future\nsystems are expected to advance in two directions: improvements of remote\nmanipulation robots and developments of image-guided robots. SUMMARY: The final\ngoal of robots is to allow safer and more homogeneous outcomes with less\nvariability of surgeon performance, as well as new tools to perform tasks on\nthe basis of medical transcutaneous imaging, in a less invasive way, at lower\ncosts. It is expected that improvements for a remote system could be augmented\nin reality, with haptic feedback, size reduction, and development of new tools\nfor natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The paradigm of\nimage-guided robots is close to clinical availability and the most advanced\nrobots are presented with end-user technical assessments. It is also notable\nthat the potential of robots lies much further ahead than the accomplishments\nof the daVinci system. The integration of imaging with robotics holds a\nsubstantial promise, because this can accomplish tasks otherwise impossible.\nImage-guided robots have the potential to offer a paradigm shift."

    "summary": "Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is one of the major health problems in\nmechanical work especially in manual handling jobs. Muscle fatigue is believed\nto be the main reason for MSD. Posture analysis techniques have been used to\nexpose MSD risks of the work, but most of the conventional methods are only\nsuitable for static posture analysis. Meanwhile the subjective influences from\nthe inspectors can result differences in the risk assessment. Another\ndisadvantage is that the evaluation has to be taken place in the workshop, so\nit is impossible to avoid some design defects before data collection in the\nfield environment and it is time consuming. In order to enhance the efficiency\nof ergonomic MSD risk evaluation and avoid subjective influences, we develop a\nnew muscle fatigue model and a new fatigue index to evaluate the human muscle\nfatigue during manual handling jobs in this paper. Our new fatigue model is\nclosely related to the muscle load during working procedure so that it can be\nused to evaluate the dynamic working process. This muscle fatigue model is\nmathematically validated and it is to be further experimental validated and\nintegrated into a virtual working environment to evaluate the muscle fatigue\nand predict the MSD risks quickly and objectively."

    "summary": "In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are\nmultiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive\nin the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site\nservice that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the\nvehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required\non-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by\nthe expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that\ndemand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the\nservice vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each\nclass. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex\ncombination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its\nperformance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the\nservice vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy\nperforms within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal),\nwhere the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of\nthe number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service\ntimes, and the convex combination coefficients."

The vehicles operate in a\nconvex environment with bounded velocity and must service demands whose time of\narrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; the objective is to\nminimize the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. The\ngeneral problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem\n(m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized\na-priori task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment,\ne.g. changes in load conditions; therefore, they are of limited applicability\nin scenarios involving ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles operating in a\ntime-varying environment. First, we present a new class of policies for the\n1-DTRP problem that: (i) are provably optimal both in light- and heavy-load\ncondition, and (ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against\nchanges in load conditions. Second, we show that partitioning policies, whereby\nthe environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a\ncertain set of rules in its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions.\nFinally, by combining the new class of algorithms for the 1-DTRP with suitable\npartitioning policies, we design distributed algorithms for the m-DTRP problem\nthat (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to\nnetwork changes, (ii) are within a constant-factor of optimal in heavy-load\nconditions and stabilize the system in any load condition.

In this\npaper, we present a soft motion trajectory planner to try to ensure that these\nconstraints are satisfied. This planner can be used on-line to establish visual\nand force control loop suitable in presence of human. The cubic trajectories\nbuild by this planner are good candidates as output of a manipulation task\nplanner. The obtained system is then homogeneous from task planning to robot\ncontrol. The soft motion trajectory planner limits jerk, acceleration and\nvelocity in cartesian space using quaternion. Experimental results carried out\non a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE arm are presented."

    "summary": "We introduce a problem in which a service vehicle seeks to guard a deadline\n(boundary) from dynamically arriving mobile targets. The environment is a\nrectangle and the deadline is one of its edges. Targets arrive continuously\nover time on the edge opposite the deadline, and move towards the deadline at a\nfixed speed. The goal for the vehicle is to maximize the fraction of targets\nthat are captured before reaching the deadline. We consider two cases; when the\nservice vehicle is faster than the targets, and; when the service vehicle is\nslower than the targets. In the first case we develop a novel vehicle policy\nbased on computing longest paths in a directed acyclic graph. We give a lower\nbound on the capture fraction of the policy and show that the policy is optimal\nwhen the distance between the target arrival edge and deadline becomes very\nlarge. We present numerical results which suggest near optimal performance away\nfrom this limiting regime. In the second case, when the targets are slower than\nthe vehicle, we propose a policy based on servicing fractions of the\ntranslational minimum Hamiltonian path. In the limit of low target speed and\nhigh arrival rate, the capture fraction of this policy is within a small\nconstant factor of the optimal."

    "summary": "This paper discusses the utility of using simple stiffness and vibrations\nmodels, based on the Jacobian matrix of a manipulator and only the rigidity of\nthe actuators, whenever its geometry is optimised. In many works, these\nsimplified models are used to propose optimal design of robots. However, the\nelasticity of the drive system is often negligible in comparison with the\nelasticity of the elements, especially in applications where high dynamic\nperformances are needed. Therefore, the use of such a simplified model may lead\nto the creation of robots with long legs, which will be submitted to large\nbending and twisting deformations. This paper presents an example of\nmanipulator for which it is preferable to use a complete stiffness or vibration\nmodel to obtain the most suitable design and shows that the use of simplified\nmodels can lead to mechanisms with poorer rigidity."

This paper deals with an original approach of machining\npreparation integrating this adequacy in the main tasks carried out. In this\napproach, the design of the machining process is based on two levels of\ndecomposition of the geometrical model of a given die with respect to HSM\ncutting conditions (cutting speed and feed rate) and technological constrains\n(tool selection, features accessibility).

The difficulty inherent in HSM operations lies in understanding\nthe impact of machine tool behaviour on machining time and part quality.\nAnalysis of some of the relevant ISO standards (230-1998, 10791-1998) and a\ncomplementary protocol for better understanding HSM technology are presented in\nthe first part of this paper. These ISO standards are devoted to the procedures\nimplemented in order to study the behavior of machine tool. As these procedures\ndo not integrate HSM technology, the need for HSM machine tool tests becomes\ncritical to improving the trade-off between machining time and part quality. A\nnew protocol for analysing the HSM technology impact during circular\ninterpolation is presented in the second part of the paper. This protocol which\nallows evaluating kinematic machine tool behaviour during circular\ninterpolation was designed from tests without machining. These tests are\ndiscussed and their results analysed in the paper. During the circular\ninterpolation, axis capacities (such as acceleration or Jerk) related to\ncertain setting parameters of the numerical control unit have a significant\nimpact on the value of the feed rate. Consequently, a kinematic model for a\ncircular-interpolated trajectory was developed on the basis of these\nparameters. Moreover, the link between part accuracy and kinematic machine tool\nbehaviour was established. The kinematic model was ultimately validated on a\nbore machining simulation."

    "summary": "Nowadays high speed machining (HSM) machine tool combines productivity and\npart quality. So mould and die maker invested in HSM. Die and mould features\nare more and more complex shaped. Thus, it is difficult to choose the best\nmachining strategy according to part shape. Geometrical analysis of machining\nfeatures is not sufficient to make an optimal choice. Some research show that\nsecurity, technical, functional and economical constrains must be taken into\naccount to elaborate a machining strategy. During complex shape machining,\nproduction system limits induce feed rate decreases, thus loss of productivity,\nin some part areas. In this paper we propose to analyse these areas by\nestimating tool path quality. First we perform experiments on HSM machine tool\nto determine trajectory impact on machine tool behaviour. Then, we extract\ncritical criteria and establish models of performance loss. Our work is focused\non machine tool kinematical performance and numerical controller unit\ncalculation capacity. We implement these models on Esprit CAM Software. During\nmachining trajectory creation, critical part areas can be visualised and\nanalysed. Parameters, such as, segment or arc lengths, nature of\ndiscontinuities encountered are used to analyse critical part areas.

    "summary": "It was shown recently that parallel manipulators with several inverse\nkinematic solutions have the ability to avoid parallel singularities [Chablat\n1998a] and self-collisions [Chablat 1998b] by choosing appropriate joint\nconfigurations for the legs. In effect, depending on the joint configurations\nof the legs, a given configuration of the end-effector may or may not be free\nof singularity and collision. Characterization of the\ncollision/singularity-free workspace is useful but may be insufficient since\ntwo configurations can be accessible without collisions nor singularities but\nit may not exist a feasible trajectory between them. The goal of this paper is\nto define the maximal regions of the workspace where it is possible to execute\ntrajectories. Twodifferent families of regions are defined : 1. those regions\nwhere the end-effector can move between any set of points, and 2. the regions\nwhere any continuous path can be tracked. These regions are characterized from\nthe notion of aspects and free-aspects recently defined for parallel\nmanipulators [Chablat 1998b]. The construction of these regions is achieved by\nenrichment techniques and using an extension of the octree structures to spaces\nof dimension greater than three. Illustrative examples show the interest of\nthis study to the optimization of trajectories and the design of parallel\nmanipulators."

    "summary": "The paper focuses on the enhanced stiffness modeling of robotic manipulators\nby taking into account influence of the external force/torque acting upon the\nend point. It implements the virtual joint technique that describes the\ncompliance of manipulator elements by a set of localized six-dimensional\nsprings separated by rigid links and perfect joints. In contrast to the\nconventional formulation, which is valid for the unloaded mode and small\ndisplacements, the proposed approach implicitly assumes that the loading leads\nto the non-negligible changes of the manipulator posture and corresponding\namendment of the Jacobian. The developed numerical technique allows computing\nthe static equilibrium and relevant force/torque reaction of the manipulator\nfor any given displacement of the end-effector. This enables designer detecting\nessentially nonlinear effects in elastic behavior of manipulator, similar to\nthe buckling of beam elements. It is also proposed the linearization procedure\nthat is based on the inversion of the dedicated matrix composed of the\nstiffness parameters of the virtual springs and the Jacobians/Hessians of the\nactive and passive joints. The developed technique is illustrated by an\napplication example that deals with the stiffness analysis of a parallel\nmanipulator of the Orthoglide family."

    "summary": "Series Elastic Actuators provide many benefits in force control of robots in\nunconstrained environments. These benefits include high force fidelity,\nextremely low impedance, low friction, and good force control bandwidth. Series\nElastic Actuators employ a novel mechanical design architecture which goes\nagainst the common machine design principal of \"stiffer is better\". A compliant\nelement is placed between the gear train and driven load to intentionally\nreduce the stiffness of the actuator. A position sensor measures the\ndeflection, and the force output is accurately calculated using Hooke's Law\n(F=Kx). A control loop then servos the actuator to the desired output force.\nThe resulting actuator has inherent shock tolerance, high force fidelity and\nextremely low impedance. These characteristics are desirable in many\napplications including legged robots, exoskeletons for human performance\namplification, robotic arms, haptic interfaces, and adaptive suspensions. We\ndescribe several variations of Series Elastic Actuators that have been\ndeveloped using both electric and hydraulic components."

    "summary": "This paper presents three feedback controllers that achieve an asymptotically\nstable, periodic, and fast walking gait for a 3D (spatial) bipedal robot\nconsisting of a torso, two legs, and passive (unactuated) point feet. The\ncontact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw\nrotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and 6\nactuators. The interest of studying robots with point feet is that the robot's\nnatural dynamics must be explicitly taken into account to achieve balance while\nwalking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid\nzero dynamics, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an\nautonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit. This method allows the\ncomputations to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model.\nThe stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with\nthe linearization of the restricted Poincar\\'e map of the hybrid zero dynamics.\nThree strategies are explored. The first strategy consists of imposing a\nstability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The\nsecond strategy uses an event-based controller. In the third approach, the\neffect of output selection is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is\nproposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental\nevent-based controller."

    "summary": "FastSLAM is a framework for simultaneous localization using a\nRao-Blackwellized particle filter. In FastSLAM, particle filter is used for the\nmobile robot pose (position and orientation) estimation, and an Extended Kalman\nFilter (EKF) is used for the feature location's estimation. However, FastSLAM\ndegenerates over time. This degeneracy is due to the fact that a particle set\nestimating the pose of the robot loses its diversity. One of the main reasons\nfor loosing particle diversity in FastSLAM is sample impoverishment. It occurs\nwhen likelihood lies in the tail of the proposal distribution. In this case,\nmost of particle weights are insignificant. Another problem of FastSLAM relates\nto the design of an extended Kalman filter for landmark position's estimation.\nThe performance of the EKF and the quality of the estimation depends heavily on\ncorrect a priori knowledge of the process and measurement noise covariance\nmatrices (Q and R) that are in most applications unknown. On the other hand, an\nincorrect a priori knowledge of Q and R may seriously degrade the performance\nof the Kalman filter. This paper presents a Neuro-Fuzzy Multi Swarm FastSLAM\nFramework. In our proposed method, a Neuro-Fuzzy extended kalman filter for\nlandmark feature estimation, and a particle filter based on particle swarm\noptimization are presented to overcome the impoverishment of FastSLAM.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "summary": "During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning\nalgorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown\nto work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as\nprobabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of\nthe solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The\nfirst contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under\nmild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges\nalmost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered,\ncalled the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost\nof the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a\ntree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT$^*$ algorithm, which\npreserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure\nlike RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections\nbetween sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random\ngeometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the\nnumber of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT$^*$ algorithms is\nasymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT."

Most traditional methods for work system analysis need\nphysical mock-up and are time consuming. Digital mockup (DMU) and digital human\nmodeling (DHM) techniques have been developed to assist ergonomic design and\nevaluation for a specific worker population (e.g. 95 percentile); however, the\noperation adaptability and adjustability for a specific individual are not\nconsidered enough.

A motion tracking system is used to track a\nworker's operation while he/she is conducting a manual handling work. The\nmotion data is transferred to a simulation computer for real time digital human\nsimulation.

The physical\nstatus (the physical capacity of virtual human) has been mostly treated as\ninvariable in the current available human simulation tools, while indeed the\nphysical capacity varies along time in an operation and the change of the\nphysical capacity depends on the history of the work as well. Virtual Human\nStatus is proposed in this paper in order to assess the difficulty of manual\nhandling operations, especially from the physical perspective. The decrease of\nthe physical capacity before and after an operation is used as an index to\nindicate the work difficulty. The reduction of physical strength is simulated\nin a theoretical approach on the basis of a fatigue model in which fatigue\nresistances of different muscle groups were regressed from 24 existing maximum\nendurance time (MET) models. A framework based on digital human modeling\ntechnique is established to realize the comparison of physical status.

    "summary": "Most cognitive architectures rely on discrete representation, both in space\n(e.g., objects) and in time (e.g., events). However, a robot interaction with\nthe world is inherently continuous, both in space and in time. The segmentation\nof the stream of perceptual inputs a robot receives into discrete and\nmeaningful events poses as a challenge in bridging the gap between internal\ncognitive representations, and the external world. Event Segmentation Theory,\nrecently proposed in the context of cognitive systems research, sustains that\nhumans segment time into events based on matching perceptual input with\npredictions. In this work we propose a framework for online event segmentation,\ntargeting robots endowed with active perception. Moreover, sensory processing\nsystems have an intrinsic latency, resulting from many factors such as sampling\nrate, and computational processing, and which is seldom accounted for. This\nframework is founded on the theory of dynamical systems synchronization, where\nthe system considered includes both the robot and the world coupled (strong\nanticipation). An adaption rule is used to perform simultaneous system\nidentification and synchronization, and anticipating synchronization is\nemployed to predict the short-term system evolution. This prediction allows for\nan appropriate control of the robot actuation. Event boundaries are detected\nonce synchronization is lost (sudden increase of the prediction error). An\nexperimental proof of concept of the proposed framework is presented, together\nwith some preliminary results corroborating the approach."

    "summary": "Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of\nthe inverse dynamic model, which is linear with respect to the dynamic\nparameters. This model is sampled while the robot is tracking reference\ntrajectories that excite the system dynamics. This allows using linear\nleast-squares techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this\nmethod has been proved through the experimental identification of many\nprototypes and industrial robots. However, this method requires the joint\nforce/torque and position measurements and the estimate of the joint velocity\nand acceleration, through the bandpass filtering of the joint position at high\nsampling rates. The proposed new method requires only the joint force/torque\nmeasurement. It is a closed-loop output error method where the usual joint\nposition output is replaced by the joint force/torque. It is based on a\nclosed-loop simulation of the robot using the direct dynamic model, the same\nstructure of the control law, and the same reference trajectory for both the\nactual and the simulated robot. The optimal parameters minimize the 2-norm of\nthe error between the actual force/torque and the simulated force/torque. This\nis a non-linear least-squares problem which is dramatically simplified using\nthe inverse dynamic model to obtain an analytical expression of the simulated\nforce/torque, linear in the parameters. A validation experiment on a 2\ndegree-of-freedom direct drive robot shows that the new method is efficient."

This problem is accentuated in\nthe case of non-holonomic sampling-based motion planning, in which the space of\nfeasible motion trajectories is restricted. In this study, we combine the C-PRM\nalgorithm by Song and Amato with our recently introduced path-hybridization\napproach, for creating high quality non-holonomic motion paths, with\ncombinations of several different quality measures such as path length,\nsmoothness or clearance, as well as the number of reverse car motions.

    "summary": "Most commercial manufacturers of industrial robots require their robots to be\nprogrammed in a proprietary language tailored to the domain - a typical\ndomain-specific language (DSL). However, these languages oftentimes suffer from\nshortcomings such as controller-specific design, limited expressiveness and a\nlack of extensibility. For that reason, we developed the extensible Robotics\nAPI for programming industrial robots on top of a general-purpose language.\nAlthough being a very flexible approach to programming industrial robots, a\nfully-fledged language can be too complex for simple tasks. Additionally,\nlegacy support for code written in the original DSL has to be maintained.

This work deals\nwith the challenges in reverse-engineering the language and mapping its\nspecifics to the Robotics API. We introduce two different approaches of\ninterpreting and executing KRL programs: tree-based and bytecode-based\ninterpretation."

    "summary": "Smart homes are becoming more popular, as every day a new home appliance can\nbe digitally controlled. Smart Digital Homes are using a server to make\ninteraction with all the possible devices in one place, on a computer or\nwebpage. In this paper we designed and implemented a mobile application using\nWindows Mobile platform that can connect to the controlling server of a Smart\nHome and grants the access to the Smart Home devices and robots everywhere\npossible. UML diagrams are presented to illustrate the application design\nprocess. Robots are also considered as devices that are able to interact to\nother object and devices. Scenarios are defined as a set of sequential actions\nto help manage different tasks all in one place. The mobile application can\nconnect to the server using GPRS mobile internet and Short Message System\n(SMS). Interactive home map is also designed for easier status-checking and\ninteracting with the devices using the mobile phones."

    "summary": "The development of robot control programs is a complex task. Many robots are\ndifferent in their electrical and mechanical structure which is also reflected\nin the software. Specific robot software environments support the program\ndevelopment, but are mainly text-based and usually applied by experts in the\nfield with profound knowledge of the target robot. This paper presents a\ngraphical programming environment which aims to ease the development of robot\ncontrol programs. In contrast to existing graphical robot programming\nenvironments, our approach focuses on the composition of parallel action\nsequences. The developed environment allows to schedule independent robot\nactions on parallel execution lines and provides mechanism to avoid\nside-effects of parallel actions. The developed environment is\nplatform-independent and based on the model-driven paradigm. The feasibility of\nour approach is shown by the application of the sequencer to a simulated\nservice robot and a robot for educational purpose."

However, those ergonomics analysis tools are mainly based\non posture analysis techniques, and until now there is still no fatigue index\navailable in the commercial software to evaluate the physical fatigue easily\nand quickly.

    "summary": "In this article we address the problem of catching objects that move at a\nrelatively large distance from the robot, of the order of tens of times the\nsize of the robot itself. To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and\nvisual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a\nrobotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector\nand controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light\ntether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used\nto retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In\nprevious work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch\nstatic objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable\nfor applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this\npaper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the\nend- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an\ninnovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control\nloop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To\nachieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for\nreal-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback\nscheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is\ndemonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot."

Mutual access to\nresources has been proved for the proposed approach while condition on the\nmaximum number of AGVs is given to ensure the absence of deadlocks during\nsystem evolutions.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of detecting possible intruders in a group\nof autonomous robots, which coexist in a shared environment and interact with\neach other according to a set of \"social behaviors\", or common rules. Such\nrules specify what actions each robot is allowed to perform in the pursuit of\nits individual goals: rules are distributed, i.e. they can evaluated based only\non the state of the individual robot, and on information that can be sensed\ndirectly or through communication with immediate neighbors. We consider\nintruders as robots which misbehave, i.e. do not follow the rules, because of\neither spontaneous failures or malicious reprogramming. Our goal is to detect\nintruders by observing the congruence of their behavior with the social rules\nas applied to the current state of the overall system. Moreover, in accordance\nwith the fully distributed nature of the problem, the detection itself must be\npeformed by individual robots, based only on local information. The paper\nintroduces a formalism that allows to model uniformly a large variety of\npossible robot societies. The main contribution consists in the proposal of an\nIntrusion Detection System, i.e. a protocol that, under suitabkle conditions,\nallows individual robots to detect possible misbehaving robots in their\nvicinity, and trigger possible further actions to secure the society. It is\nworth noting that the generality of the protocol formalism makes so that local\nmonitors can be automatically generated once the cooperation rules and the\nrobot dynamics are specified. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is\nshown through application to examples of automated robotic systems."

    "summary": "In this research report details of design of a miniature wheel arrangement\nare presented. This miniature wheel arrangement is essentially a direction\ncontrol mechanism intended for use on a mobile robot platform or base. The\ndesign is a specific one employing a stepper motor as actuator and as described\ncan only be used on a certain type of wheeled robots. However, as a basic\nsteering control element, more than one of these miniature wheel arrangements\ncan be grouped together to implement more elaborate and intelligent direction\ncontrol schemes on varying configurations of wheeled mobile robot platforms."

    "summary": "During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as\nProbabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have\nbeen shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as\nprobabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the\nformal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms,\ne.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to\nfill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of\nthe solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of\nsamples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing\nexisting algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the\ncost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms\nconverges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the\npaper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are\nprovably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned\nsolution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the\ncomputational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of\nthat of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal)\ncounterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between\nstochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random\ngeometric graphs."

    "summary": "The ability to place objects in the environment is an important skill for a\npersonal robot. An object should not only be placed stably, but should also be\nplaced in its preferred location/orientation. For instance, a plate is\npreferred to be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to\nbe placed horizontally in it. Unstructured environments such as homes have a\nlarge variety of object types as well as of placing areas. Therefore our\nalgorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing\nareas. These reasons make placing a challenging manipulation task. In this\nwork, we propose a supervised learning algorithm for finding good placements\ngiven the point-clouds of the object and the placing area. It learns to combine\nthe features that capture support, stability and preferred placements using a\nshared sparsity structure in the parameters. Even when neither the object nor\nthe placing area is seen previously in the training set, our algorithm predicts\ngood placements. In extensive experiments, our method enables the robot to\nstably place several new objects in several new placing areas with 98%\nsuccess-rate; and it placed the objects in their preferred placements in 92% of\nthe cases."

    "summary": "Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data\nhave become widely available. We use this data to build 3D point clouds of a\nfull scene. In this paper, we address the task of labeling objects in this 3D\npoint cloud of a complete indoor scene such as an office. We propose a\ngraphical model that captures various features and contextual relations,\nincluding the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurrence\nrelationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object\nclasses and relations, the model's parsimony becomes important and we address\nthat by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efficient\napproximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning\napproach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and offices\n(composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object\nclasses), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for\noffices, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes.

These manipulators are geometrically characterized by the fact that the\nmoving triangle is the image of the base triangle by an indirect isometry. We\nintroduce a specific coordinate system adapted to this geometric feature and\nwhich is also well adapted to the splitting of the DKP. This allows us to\nobtain easily precise descriptions of the singularities and of the cusp edges.\nThese latter second order singularities are important for nonsingular assembly\nmode changing.

    "summary": "A novel sensory substitution technique is presented. Kinesthetic and\ncutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback (CF) only,\nprovided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and\nthe thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force\npattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in\nterms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern\napplied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both\ncutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the\ncutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic\nfeedback (HF) and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this\napproach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle\ninsertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is\nconnected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task.\nExperiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the\ncutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by\nthe user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. As most of the\nsensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique\nalso has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation\nsystems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show\nthat the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with\nmore conventional visual feedback (VF)."

Hypothesis or\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the 3D torques and powers\nof the forelimb joints at trotting. Methods: Eight sound horses were used in\nthe study. A full 3D torque and power for elbow, carpus, fetlock, pastern and\ncoffin joints of right forelimb in horses at trot were obtained by calculating\nthe inverse kinetics of simplified link segmental model. Results: Over two\nthird of energy (70%) generated by all joints come from stance phase, and most\nof energy generated was by elbow joint both in stance (77%) and sway (88%)\nphases. Energy absorbed by all joints during stance (40%) and sway (60%) phases\nrespectively is not a big difference. During stance phase, all most two third\nof energy (65%) absorbed was by fetlock joint, while over two third of energy\n(74%) absorbed was by carpus joint during sway phase. Conclusions & Clinical\nRelevance: This study presents a full 3D kinetic analysis of the relative\nmotion of the humerus, radius, cannon, pastern and coffin segments of the\nforelimb at the trot.

Most of the current robotic fish generate bending motion\nusing rotary motors which implies at least one mechanical conversion of the\nmotion. We seek a solution that directly bends the fin and, at the same time,\nis able to exploit the magneto-mechanical properties of the fin material. This\nstrong fin-actuator coupling blends the actuator and the body of the robot,\nallowing cross optimization of the system's elements.\n  We study a simplified model of an elastic element, a spring-mass system\nrepresenting a flexible fin, subjected to nonlinear forcing, emulating magnetic\ninteraction. The dynamics of the system is studied under unforced and periodic\nforcing conditions. The analysis is focused on the limit cycles present in the\nsystem, which allows the periodic bending of the fin and the generation of\nthrust. The frequency, maximum amplitude and center of the periodic orbits\n(offset of the bending) depend directly on the stiffness of the fin and the\nintensity of the forcing; we use this dependency to sketch a simple parameter\ncontroller. Although the model is strongly simplified, it provides means to\nestimate first values of the parameters for this kind of actuator and it is\nuseful to evaluate the feasibility of minimal actuation control of such\nsystems."

In a general context, the mechanism of self-awareness\nbelongs to a class of co-called \"self-issues\" (self-* or self-star):\nself-adaptation, self-repairing, self-replication, self-development or\nself-recovery. The self-* issues are connected in many ways to adaptability and\nevolvability, to the emergence of behavior and to the controllability of\nlong-term developmental processes. Self-* are either natural properties of\nseveral systems, such as self-assembling of molecular networks, or may emerge\nas a result of homeostatic regulation. Different computational processes,\nleading to a global optimization, increasing scalability and reliability of\ncollective systems, create such a homeostatic regulation. Moreover, conditions\nof ecological survival, imposed on such systems, lead to a discrimination\nbetween \"self\" and \"non-self\" as well as to the emergence of different\nself-phenomena. There are many profound challenges, such as understanding these\nmechanisms, or long-term predictability, which have a considerable impact on\nresearch in the area of artificial intelligence and intelligent systems."

    "summary": "The six axis robots are widely used in automotive industry for their good\nrepeatability (as defined in the ISO92983) (painting, welding, mastic\ndeposition, handling etc.). In the aerospace industry, robot starts to be used\nfor complex applications such as drilling, riveting, fiber placement, NDT, etc.\nGiven the positioning performance of serial robots, precision applications\nrequire usually external measurement device with complexes calibration\nprocedure in order to reach the precision needed. New applications in the\nmachining field of composite material (aerospace, naval, or wind turbine for\nexample) intend to use off line programming of serial robot without the use of\ncalibration or external measurement device. For those applications, the\nposition, orientation and path trajectory precision of the tool center point of\nthe robot are needed to generate the machining operation. This article presents\nthe different conditions that currently limit the development of robots in\nrobotic machining applications. We analyze the dynamical behavior of a robot\nKUKA KR240-2 (located at the University of Bordeaux 1) equipped with a HSM\nSpindle (42000 rpm, 18kW). This analysis is done in three stages. The first\nstep is determining the self-excited frequencies of the robot structure for\nthree different configurations of work. The second phase aims to analyze the\ndynamical vibration of the structure as the spindle is activated without\ncutting. The third stage consists of vibration analysis during a milling\noperation."

The goal\nis to minimize the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing\nproposition while ensuring that the LTL formula is satisfied even with\nuncertainty in the robots' traveling times. We characterize a class of LTL\nformulas that are robust to robot timing errors, for which we generate optimal\npaths if no timing errors are present, and we present bounds on the deviation\nfrom the optimal values in the presence of errors.

    "summary": "Placing is a necessary skill for a personal robot to have in order to perform\ntasks such as arranging objects in a disorganized room. The object placements\nshould not only be stable but also be in their semantically preferred placing\nareas and orientations. This is challenging because an environment can have a\nlarge variety of objects and placing areas that may not have been seen by the\nrobot before.\n  In this paper, we propose a learning approach for placing multiple objects in\ndifferent placing areas in a scene. Given point-clouds of the objects and the\nscene, we design appropriate features and use a graphical model to encode\nvarious properties, such as the stacking of objects, stability, object-area\nrelationship and common placing constraints. The inference in our model is an\ninteger linear program, which we solve efficiently via an LP relaxation. We\nextensively evaluate our approach on 98 objects from 16 categories being placed\ninto 40 areas. Our robotic experiments show a success rate of 98% in placing\nknown objects and 82% in placing new objects stably. We use our method on our\nrobots for performing tasks such as loading several dish-racks, a bookshelf and\na fridge with multiple items."

Their ability to adapt to varying pathogens makes such\nsystems a suitable choice for various robotic applications. Generally,\nAIS-based robotic applications map local instantaneous sensory information into\neither an antigen or a co-stimulatory signal, according to the choice of\nrepresentation schema. Algorithms then use relevant immune functions to output\neither evolved antibodies or maturity of dendritic cells, in terms of actuation\nsignals. It is observed that researchers, in an attempt to solve the problem in\nhand, do not try to replicate the biological immunity but select necessary\nimmune functions instead, resulting in an ad-hoc manner these applications are\nreported. Authors, therefore, present a comprehensive review of immuno-inspired\nrobotic applications in an attempt to categorize them according to underlying\nimmune definitions. Implementation details are tabulated in terms of\ncorresponding mathematical expressions and their representation schema that\ninclude binary, real or hybrid data. Limitations of reported applications are\nalso identified in light of modern immunological interpretations. As a result\nof this study, authors suggest a renewed focus on innate immunity and also\nemphasize that immunological representations should benefit from robot\nembodiment and must be extended to include modern trends."

Every robot is no longer required to\nmove to a specific target, but rather to some target placement that is assigned\nto its group. We call this problem k-color multi-robot motion planning and\nprovide a sampling-based algorithm specifically designed for solving it. At the\nheart of the algorithm is a novel technique where the k-color problem is\nreduced to several discrete multi-robot motion planning problems. These\nreductions amplify basic samples into massive collections of free placements\nand paths for the robots. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by an\nimplementation for the case of disc robots and polygonal robots translating in\nthe plane. We show that the algorithm successfully and efficiently copes with a\nvariety of challenging scenarios, involving many robots, while a simplified\nversion of this algorithm, that can be viewed as an extension of a prevalent\nsampling-based algorithm for the k-color case, fails even on simple scenarios.\nInterestingly, our algorithm outperforms a well established implementation of\nPRM for the standard multi-robot problem, in which each robot has a distinct\ncolor."

It is advocated this error can be much reduced if the data\nis fused with measurements from other motion sensors, or even with prior\nknowledge on the motion. The data fusion is performed by a recently introduced\nspecific extended Kalman filter, the so-called Invariant EKF, and is directly\nbased on the estimated covariance of the ICP. The resulting filter is very\nnatural, and is proved to possess strong properties.

The second method\nallows the operator on the ground to select the interest object for the UAV to\ntrack. The tracking system is capable of re-detecting the object of interest in\nthe events of tracking failure.

    "summary": "Low-cost sensing gloves for reconstruction posture provide measurements which\nare limited under several regards. They are generated through an imperfectly\nknown model, are subject to noise, and may be less than the number of Degrees\nof Freedom (DoFs) of the hand. Under these conditions, direct reconstruction of\nthe hand posture is an ill-posed problem, and performance can be very poor.\nThis paper examines the problem of estimating the posture of a human hand\nusing(low-cost) sensing gloves, and how to improve their performance by\nexploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands. To\nincrease the accuracy of pose reconstruction without modifying the glove\nhardware - hence basically at no extra cost - we propose to collect, organize,\nand exploit information on the probabilistic distribution of human hand poses\nin common tasks. We discuss how a database of such an a priori information can\nbe built, represented in a hierarchy of correlation patterns or postural\nsynergies, and fused with glove data in a consistent way, so as to provide a\ngood hand pose reconstruction in spite of insufficient and inaccurate sensing\ndata. Simulations and experiments on a low-cost glove are reported which\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of carrier-phase differential GPS positioning for an\nland vehicle navigation system (LVNS), tightly coupled with an inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) and a speedometer. The primary focus is to apply\nBayesian network to an IMU-aided GPS positioning system based on carrier-phase\ndifferential GPS. We describe the implementation details of the positioning\nsystem that integrates GPS measurements (i.e., pseudo-range, carrier-phase and\ndoppler), IMU measurements, and speedometer measurements. We derive the\nlinearized state process equation and the measurement equation for GPS and\nspeedometer. To account for constraints of land vehicle, we add two more pseudo\nmeasurements to ensure the perpendicular velocities close to zero."

    "summary": "During the conceptual and prototype design stage of an industrial product, it\nis crucial to take assembly/disassembly and maintenance operations in advance.\nA well-designed system should enable relatively easy access of operating\nmanipulators in the constrained environment and reduce musculoskeletal disorder\nrisks for those manual handling operations. Trajectory planning comes up as an\nimportant issue for those assembly and maintenance operations under a\nconstrained environment, since it determines the accessibility and the other\nergonomics issues, such as muscle effort and its related fatigue. In this\npaper, a customer-oriented interactive approach is proposed to partially solve\nergonomic related issues encountered during the design stage under a\nconstrained system for the operator's convenience. Based on a single objective\noptimization method, trajectory planning for different operators could be\ngenerated automatically. Meanwhile, a motion capture based method assists the\noperator to guide the trajectory planning interactively when either a local\nminimum is encountered within the single objective optimization or the operator\nprefers guiding the virtual human manually. Besides that, a physical engine is\nintegrated into this approach to provide physically realistic simulation in\nreal time manner, so that collision free path and related dynamic information\ncould be computed to determine further muscle fatigue and accessibility of a\nproduct design"

    "summary": "Pushing/Pulling tasks is an important part of work in many industries.\nUsually, most researchers study the Push/Pull tasks by analyzing different\nposture conditions, force requirements, velocity factors, etc. However few\nstudies have reported the effects of fatigue. Fatigue caused by physical\nloading is one of the main reasons responsible for MusculoSkeletal Disorders\n(MSD). In this paper, muscle groups of articulation is considered and from\njoint level a new approach is proposed for muscle fatigue evaluation in the\narms Push/Pull operations. The objective of this work is to predict the muscle\nfatigue situation in the Push/Pull tasks in order to reduce the probability of\nMSD problems for workers.

    "summary": "Many robotic systems deal with uncertainty by performing a sequence of\ninformation gathering actions. In this work, we focus on the problem of\nefficiently constructing such a sequence by drawing an explicit connection to\nsubmodularity. Ideally, we would like a method that finds the optimal sequence,\ntaking the minimum amount of time while providing sufficient information.\nFinding this sequence, however, is generally intractable. As a result, many\nwell-established methods select actions greedily. Surprisingly, this often\nperforms well. Our work first explains this high performance -- we note a\ncommonly used metric, reduction of Shannon entropy, is submodular under certain\nassumptions, rendering the greedy solution comparable to the optimal plan in\nthe offline setting. However, reacting online to observations can increase\nperformance. Recently developed notions of adaptive submodularity provide\nguarantees for a greedy algorithm in this online setting. In this work, we\ndevelop new methods based on adaptive submodularity for selecting a sequence of\ninformation gathering actions online. In addition to providing guarantees, we\ncan capitalize on submodularity to attain additional computational speedups. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simulation and on a robot."

In many cases, these sub-tasks cannot all be achieved jointly\nand a prioritization of such sub-tasks is required to resolve this issue. In\nthis paper, we discuss a novel learning approach that allows to learn a\nprioritized control law built on a set of sub-tasks represented by motor\nprimitives. The primitives are executed simultaneously but have different\npriorities. Primitives of higher priority can override the commands of the\nconflicting lower priority ones. The dominance structure of these primitives\nhas a significant impact on the performance of the prioritized control law.

We assume that the vehicle can determine its\nprecise initial position in a known map of the environment. However, inspired\nby practical limitations, we assume that the vehicle is equipped with noisy\nactuators and, during its motion in the environment, it can only measure the\nangular velocity of its wheels using limited accuracy incremental encoders.\nAssuming the duration of the motion is finite, we map the measurements to a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP). We use recent results in Statistical Model\nChecking (SMC) to obtain an MDP control policy that maximizes the probability\nof satisfaction. We translate this policy to a vehicle feedback control\nstrategy and show that the probability that the vehicle satisfies the\nspecification in the environment is bounded from below by the probability of\nsatisfying the specification on the MDP. We illustrate our method with\nsimulations and experimental results."

    "summary": "Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages\nand Models for Robotic Systems (DSLRob'12), held at the 2012 International\nConference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots\n(SIMPAR 2012), November 2012 in Tsukuba, Japan.\n  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and\nModel-driven Architecture (MDA) for robotics. A domain-specific language (DSL)\nis a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain that offers\nspecific notations and abstractions that increase programmer productivity\nwithin that domain. Models-driven architecture (MDA) offers a high-level way\nfor domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right\nlevel of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for\nprogramming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a\nseparate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a\nholistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,\nuncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional\ngeneral-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language\nfeatures and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,\nsystematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and\nprecisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the\nrobotics domain."

    "summary": "There is no dearth of new robots that provide both generalized and customized\nplatforms for learning and research. Unfortunately as we attempt to adapt\nexisting software components, we are faced with an explosion of device drivers\nthat interface each hardware platform with existing frameworks. We certainly\ngain the efficiencies of reusing algorithms and tools developed across\nplatforms but only once the device driver is created.\n  We propose a domain specific language that describes the development and\nruntime interface of a robot and defines its link to existing frameworks. The\nRobot Device Interface Specification (RDIS) takes advantage of the internal\nfirmware present on many existing devices by defining the communication\nmechanism, syntax and semantics in such a way to enable the generation of\nautomatic interface links and resource discovery. We present the current domain\nmodel as it relates to differential drive robots as a mechanism to use the RDIS\nto link described robots to HTML5 via web sockets and ROS (Robot Operating\nSystem)."

    "summary": "This work-in-progress paper reports on our efforts to improve different\naspects of coordination in complex, component-based robotic systems.\nCoordination is a system level aspect concerned with commanding, configuring\nand monitoring functional computations such that the system as a whole behaves\nas desired. To that end a variety of models such as Petri-nets or Finite State\nMachines may be utilized. These models specify actions to be executed, such as\ninvoking operations or configuring components to achieve a certain goal.\n  This traditional approach has several disadvantages related to loss of\nreusability of coordination models due to coupling with platform-specific\nfunctionality, non-deterministic temporal behavior and limited robustness as a\nresult of executing platform operations within the context of the coordinator.\n  To avoid these shortcomings, we propose to split this \"rich\" coordinator into\na Pure Coordinator and a Configurator. Although the coordinator remains in\ncharge of commanding and reacting, the execution of actions is deferred to the\nConfigurator. This pattern, called \"Coordinator-Configurator\", is implemented\nas a novel Configurator domain specific language that can be used together with\nany model of coordination. We illustrate the approach by refactoring an\nexisting application that realizes a safe haptic coupling of two youBot mobile\nmanipulators."

Therefore, due to\ncombinatorial explosion of potential situations, it is not possible to foresee\nall eventualities in advance during robot design. In addition, due to limited\nresources on a mobile robot, it is not feasible to plan any action on demand.\nHence, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to express variability at\ndesign-time that can be efficiently resolved on the robot at run-time based on\nthe then available information. In this paper, we introduce a DSL to express\nrun- time variability focused on the execution quality of the robot (in terms\nof non-functional properties like safety and task efficiency) under changing\nsituations and limited resources. We underpin the applicability of our approach\nby an example integrated into an overall robotics architecture."

    "summary": "We present Lower Bound Tree-RRT (LBT-RRT), a single-query sampling-based\nalgorithm that is asymptotically near-optimal. Namely, the solution extracted\nfrom LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of\n1+epsilon of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous\ninterpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal\nRRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no\napproximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like RRG. When the approximation\nfactor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like RRT. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to\nproduce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster\nthan RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of\nthe RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary graph, which we call the lower-bound\ngraph. The combination of the two roadmaps, which is faster to maintain than\nthe roadmap maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantees asymptotic\nnear-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion\nplanning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging\nfrom 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation\nfactors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRG and\nRRT*) with little running-time overhead when compared to RRT."

However, the vast majority of these algorithms is devised to learn to\nwalk in a straight line, which is not sufficient to accomplish any real-world\nmission. Here we introduce the Transferability-based Behavioral Repertoire\nEvolution algorithm (TBR-Evolution), a novel evolutionary algorithm that\nsimultaneously discovers several hundreds of simple walking controllers, one\nfor each possible direction. By taking advantage of solutions that are usually\ndiscarded by evolutionary processes, TBR-Evolution is substantially faster than\nindependently evolving each controller. Our technique relies on two methods:\n(1) novelty search with local competition, which searches for both\nhigh-performing and diverse solutions, and (2) the transferability approach,\nwhich com-bines simulations and real tests to evolve controllers for a physical\nrobot. We evaluate this new technique on a hexapod robot. Results show that\nwith only a few dozen short experiments performed on the robot, the algorithm\nlearns a repertoire of con-trollers that allows the robot to reach every point\nin its reachable space. Overall, TBR-Evolution opens a new kind of learning\nalgorithm that simultaneously optimizes all the achievable behaviors of a\nrobot."

Moreover, we provide an\nexplicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed to\nachieve distance optimality in terms of the robots' communication and\ntarget-sensing ranges with arbitrary guaranteed probabilities. The same bounds\nare also shown to be asymptotically tight.\n  In the second half of the paper, we present suboptimal strategies for use\nwhen the number of robots cannot be chosen freely. Assuming first that all\ntargets are known to all robots, we employ a hierarchical communication model\nin which robots communicate only with other robots in the same partitioned\nregion. This hierarchical communication model leads to constant approximations\nof true distance-optimal solutions under mild assumptions. We then revisit the\nlimited communication and sensing models. By combining simple rendezvous-based\nstrategies with a hierarchical communication model, we obtain decentralized\nhierarchical strategies that achieve constant approximation ratios with respect\nto true distance optimality.

In many situations each member of the swarm must update its\nknowledge about the environment as soon as possible, thus every effort to\nexpand the knowledge horizon is useful. Otherwise critical information may not\nreach nodes far from the source causing dangerous misbehaviour of the swarm. We\nconsider two extreme situations. In the first scenario we have an unique\nprobabilistic delay distribution. In the second scenario, each agent is subject\nto a different truncated gaussian distribution, meaning local conditions are\nsignificantly different from link to link. We study how several swarm\ntopologies react to the two scenarios and how to allocate the more efficient\ntransmission resources in order to expand the horizon.

This new platform presents a flexible\narchitecture that enables fast/automatic system adaptive behaviour without\nhuman intervention. The concept is based on contactless technology, using\nartificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different\nworkpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces\nare virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional\n(3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are\nimplemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern\nrecognition), size, boundary and pose. Such information is then used to on-line\nadjust the base robot programmes. These robot programmes are off-line generated\nfrom a 3D computer-aided design model of each different workpiece profile.\nFinally, the robotic manipulator executes the coating process after its base\nprogrammes have been adjusted. This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system\nthat allows adapting the robots behaviour to different manufacturing\nsituations. It means that the robot is ready to work over any piece at any\ntime, and thus, small production series can be reduced to as much as a\none-object series. No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to\noperate it. Experimental results showed that this solution proved to be\nefficient and can be applied not only for spray coating purposes but also for\nmany other industrial processes (automatic manipulation, pick-and-place,\ninspection, etc.)."

    "summary": "Purpose - Most industrial robots are still programmed using the typical\nteaching process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. This is a tedious\nand time-consuming task that requires some technical expertise, and hence new\napproaches to robot programming are required. The purpose of this paper is to\npresent a robotic system that allows users to instruct and program a robot with\na high-level of abstraction from the robot language.\n  Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents in detail a robotic system\nthat allows users, especially non-expert programmers, to instruct and program a\nrobot just showing it what it should do, in an intuitive way. This is done\nusing the two most natural human interfaces (gestures and speech), a force\ncontrol system and several code generation techniques. Special attention will\nbe given to the recognition of gestures, where the data extracted from a motion\nsensor (three-axis accelerometer) embedded in the Wii remote controller was\nused to capture human hand behaviours. Gestures (dynamic hand positions) as\nwell as manual postures (static hand positions) are recognized using a\nstatistical approach and artificial neural networks.\n  Practical implications - The key contribution of this paper is that it offers\na practical method to program robots by means of gestures and speech, improving\nwork efficiency and saving time.\n  Originality/value - This paper presents an alternative to the typical robot\nteaching process, extending the concept of human-robot interaction and\nco-worker scenario. Since most companies do not have engineering resources to\nmake changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems,\nthis system constitutes a major advantage for small- to medium-sized\nenterprises."

    "summary": "We review the work on data-driven grasp synthesis and the methodologies for\nsampling and ranking candidate grasps. We divide the approaches into three\ngroups based on whether they synthesize grasps for known, familiar or unknown\nobjects. This structure allows us to identify common object representations and\nperceptual processes that facilitate the employed data-driven grasp synthesis\ntechnique. In the case of known objects, we concentrate on the approaches that\nare based on object recognition and pose estimation. In the case of familiar\nobjects, the techniques use some form of a similarity matching to a set of\npreviously encountered objects. Finally for the approaches dealing with unknown\nobjects, the core part is the extraction of specific features that are\nindicative of good grasps. Our survey provides an overview of the different\nmethodologies and discusses open problems in the area of robot grasping. We\nalso draw a parallel to the classical approaches that rely on analytic\nformulations."

    "summary": "This paper introduces a new mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving a\nsingle robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur at\ndifferent locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of transient\nevents that can not be easily forecast. Application areas range from natural\nphenomena ({\\em e.g.}, monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcano\nusing a ground robot) to urban activities ({\\em e.g.}, monitoring early\nformations of traffic congestion using an aerial robot). Motivated by those and\nmany other examples, this paper focuses on problems in which the precise\noccurrence times of the events are unknown {\\em a priori}, but statistics for\ntheir inter-arrival times are available. The robot's task is to monitor the\nevents to optimize the following two objectives: {\\em (i)} maximize the number\nof events observed and {\\em (ii)} minimize the delay between two consecutive\nobservations of events occurring at the same location. The paper considers the\ncase when a robot is tasked with optimizing the event observations in a\nbalanced manner, following a cyclic patrolling route. First, assuming the\ncyclic ordering of stations is known, we prove the existence and uniqueness of\nthe optimal solution, and show that the optimal solution has desirable\nconvergence and robustness properties. Our constructive proof also produces an\nefficient algorithm for computing the unique optimal solution with $O(n)$ time\ncomplexity, in which $n$ is the number of stations, with $O(\\log n)$ time\ncomplexity for incrementally adding or removing stations. Except for the\nalgorithm, most of the analysis remains valid when the cyclic order is unknown.\nWe then provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme that gives a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-optimal solution for this more general, NP-hard problem."

    "summary": "Many day-to-day activities require the dexterous manipulation of a redundant\nhumanoid arm in complex 3D environments. However, position regulation of such\nrobot arm systems becomes very difficult in presence of non-linear\nuncertainties in the system. Also, perturbations exist due to various unwanted\ninteractions with obstacles for clumsy environments in which obstacle avoidance\nis not possible, and this makes position regulation even more difficult. This\nreport proposes a non-linear task-space disturbance observer by virtue of which\nposition regulation of such robotic systems can be achieved in spite of such\nperturbations and uncertainties. Simulations are conducted using a 7-DOF\nredundant robot arm system to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThese results are then compared with the case of a conventional mass-damper\nbased task-space disturbance observer to show the enhancement in performance\nusing the developed concept. This proposed method is then applied to a\ncontroller which exhibits human-like motion characteristics for reaching a\ntarget. Arbitrary perturbations in the form of interactions with obstacles are\nintroduced in its path. Results show that the robot end-effector successfully\ncontinues to move in its path of a human-like quasi-straight trajectory even if\nthe joint trajectories deviated by a considerable amount due to the\nperturbations. These results are also compared with that of the unperturbed\nmotion of the robot which further prove the significance of the developed\nscheme."

Previously, we developed a novel control law to exhibit\nhuman-motion characteristics in redundant robot arm systems as well as\narm-trunk systems for reaching tasks [1], [2]. This newly developed method\nnullifies the need for the computation of pseudo-inverse of Jacobian while the\nformulation and optimization of any artificial performance index is not\nnecessary. The time-varying properties of the muscle stiffness and damping as\nwell as the low-pass filter characteristics of human muscles have been modeled\nby the proposed control law to generate human-motion characteristics for\nreaching motion like quasi-straight line trajectory of the end-effector and\nsymmetric bell shaped velocity profile. This report focuses on the experiments\nperformed using a 7-DOF redundant robot-arm system which proved the\neffectiveness of this algorithm in imitating human-like motion characteristics.\nIn addition, we extended this algorithm to a 19-DOF Hand-Arm System for a\nreach-to-grasp task. Simulations using the 19-DOF Hand-Arm System show the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme for effective human-like hand-arm\ncoordination in reach-to-grasp tasks for pinch and envelope grasps on objects\nof different shapes such as a box, a cylinder, and a sphere."

A major challenge is\nto minimize the error caused by the process of double integration of\naccelerations due to motion (these ones have to be separated from the\naccelerations due to gravity). Owing to drift error, position estimation cannot\nbe performed with adequate accuracy for periods longer than few seconds.

    "summary": "We analyze the observability of motion estimates from the fusion of visual\nand inertial sensors. Because the model contains unknown parameters, such as\nsensor biases, the problem is usually cast as a mixed identification/filtering,\nand the resulting observability analysis provides a necessary condition for any\nalgorithm to converge to a unique point estimate. Unfortunately, most models\ntreat sensor bias rates as noise, independent of other states including biases\nthemselves, an assumption that is patently violated in practice. When this\nassumption is lifted, the resulting model is not observable, and therefore past\nanalyses cannot be used to conclude that the set of states that are\nindistinguishable from the measurements is a singleton. In other words, the\nresulting model is not observable. We therefore re-cast the analysis as one of\nsensitivity: Rather than attempting to prove that the indistinguishable set is\na singleton, which is not the case, we derive bounds on its volume, as a\nfunction of characteristics of the input and its sufficient excitation. This\nprovides an explicit characterization of the indistinguishable set that can be\nused for analysis and validation purposes."

The proposed framework makes use of a graphical representation of the\nworld in order to build a map consisting of qualitative constraints on the\ngeometric relationships between landmark triplets. A novel measurement method\nbased on camera imagery is presented which extends previous work from the field\nof Qualitative Spatial Reasoning. Measurements are fused into the map using a\ndeterministic, iterative graph update. A Branch-and-Bound approach is taken to\nsolve a set of non-convex feasibility problems required for generating on-line\nmeasurements and off-line operator lookup tables. A navigation approach for\ntravel between distant landmarks is developed, using estimates of the Relative\nNeighborhood Graph extracted from the qualitative map in order to generate a\nsequence of landmark objectives based on proximity. Average and asymptotic\nperformance of the mapping algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo tests on\nrandomly generated maps, and data-driven simulation results are presented for a\nrobot traversing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mars Yard while building a\nrelational map. Simulation results demonstrate an initial rapid convergence of\nqualitative state estimates for visible landmarks, followed by a slow tapering\nas the remaining ambiguous states are removed from the map."

We model the problem as a\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which allows a general\nreward based optimization objective and takes uncertainty in temporal evolution\nand partial observations into account. In addition to occlusion dependent\nobservation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also\nautomatically adapts object specific action success probabilities. To cope with\nthe changing system dynamics and performance constraints, we present a new\nonline POMDP method based on particle filtering that produces compact policies.\nThe approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a\nscenario of moving dirty dishes into a dishwasher. The results indicate that:\n1) a greedy heuristic manipulation approach is not sufficient, multi-object\nmanipulation requires multi-step POMDP planning, and 2) on-line planning is\nbeneficial since it allows the adaptation of the system dynamics model based on\nactual experience."

We use COP to model the\nplanning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal\nfield with time-invariant spatial correlations, in which the tours are\nconstrained to have limited length. Our focus in this paper is QCOP a quadratic\nCOP formulation that only looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in a\nnode network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility function\ncapturing the said spatial correlation. QCOP may be solved using mixed integer\nquadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable of\nplanning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. In\nparticular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a network\nwith up to $150$ nodes. Besides performing extensive simulation studies to\nverify the algorithm's correctness and characterize its performance, we also\nsuccessfully applied it to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i)\nestimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal field, and (ii) estimating the\ntemperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts."

An\noperator is assumed to be an experience decision-maker and sane carrier of a\ntarget which the robotic system needs to achieve. The works characteristic is\nthat the behavior of the robotic system is not specified a priori (as standard)\nbut is formed adaptively based on the information about the situation and\ndecisions made by a decision-maker. In this scheme the robotic system and the\ndecision-maker can cooperate in the normal operation mode of the robotic system\nor in the time sharing mode with the possibility to plan actively the\nexperiment on the robotic system. If the adaptive scheme is chosen, there are\nteaching stages and operating stages of the robotic system. At that the\ndecision-maker can act slowly having the possibility to weigh the decision\nmade. This way allows the robotic system reacting flexibly by switching between\npreset models and respond to the environment instability. The data integrity\nabout the environment condition and about target preferences of an operator\nplays a very important role in robotic system work. The effective work of the\nrobotic system depends on the effective settings of a preference model of the\nrobotic system based on the decisions of the decision-maker and on the\neffective control. The influence of settings and control factors on the index\nof effectiveness of the robotic system is subject of this work. The uncertainty\nmay be caused by the data flow limitation received by the operator on the stage\nof the model setting."

The objective of this work is to\nevaluate the effect of the relative scale factor, RSF, (ratio of gear\nreductions) between these inputs on their dynamic coupling. We conceptually\ndescribe a Parallel Force/Velocity Actuator (PFVA) based on a\nDual-Input-Single- Output (DISO) epicyclic gear train. We then present an\nanalytical formulation for the variation of the dynamic coupling term w.r.t.\nRSF. Conclusions from this formulation are illustrated through a numerical\nexample involving a 1-DOF four-bar linkage. It is shown, both analytically and\nnumerically, that as we increase the RSF, the two inputs to the PFVA are\ndecoupled w.r.t. the inertia torques. This understanding can serve as an\nimportant design guideline for PFVAs. The paper also presents two limitations\nof this study and suggests future work based on these caveats."

The presented approach extends that detailed in [1] on a quadruped\nplatform by incorporating the rotational constraints imposed by the humanoid's\nflat feet. As in previous work, the proposed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)\naccommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain,\nmaking it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. The filter\nemploys a sensor-based prediction model which uses inertial data from an IMU\nand corrects for integrated error using a kinematics-based measurement model\nwhich relies on joint encoders and a kinematic model to determine the relative\nposition and orientation of the feet. A nonlinear observability analysis is\nperformed on both the original and updated filters and it is concluded that the\nnew filter significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the\nobservability characteristics of the system. Results on simulated walking and\nsquatting datasets demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as\nwell as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis."

    "summary": "To rationalize the relatively high investment that industrial automation\nsystems entail, research in the field of intelligent machines should target\nhigh value functions such as fettling, die-finishing, deburring, and\nfixtureless manufacturing. For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated\non force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on\nperformance expansion at the actuator level. We present a comprehensive\nliterature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized\nactuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was\ndeveloped using Schunk's PowerCube 6-DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque\nsensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias\nand the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to\nstudy the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions\nand programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation,\nvirtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used\nas a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the\nactuator level. The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within\nthe actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20-year research\nhistory in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept\nthat mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual\nactuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic\nmodels of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is\nevaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving\ninput trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design\nchoice of 14:1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good\nsensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking\nperformance."

The current paper formalizes these\nguarantees. It proves a formal bound on the probability that solutions returned\nby asymptotically optimal roadmap-based methods (e.g., PRM*) are within a bound\nof the optimal path length I* with clearance {\\epsilon} after a finite\niteration n. This bound has the form P(|In - I* | {\\leq} {\\delta}I*) {\\leq}\nPsuccess, where {\\delta} is an error term for the length a path in the PRM*\ngraph, In.

    "summary": "Developing robot agnostic software frameworks involves synthesizing the\ndisparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while\nsimultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and\ncontrol paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase,\nthe setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the\nentry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high,\neven the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in\nrobotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and\ncustomizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic\napplications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices\nfound for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an\nopen-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1)\nquickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2)\nautomate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its\ncomponents. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt!\nis the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing\nstandardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific\nconfiguration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These\nbest practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles\napplicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry\nbarrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against\nour design objectives for their effectiveness to users."

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel feedback method on the motion planning for\nunicycle robots in environments with static obstacles, along with an extension\nto the distributed planning and coordination in multi-robot systems. The method\nemploys a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, whose integral curves\nexhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter lambda. More\nspecifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector field has a\nunique singular point of dipole type and can be used to steer the unicycle to a\ngoal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector\nfield has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves are used to\ndefine flows around obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan can then\nbe constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a\nstatic obstacle environment. The method does not suffer from the appearance of\nsinks (stable nodes) away from goal point. Compared to other similar methods\nwhich are free of local minima, the proposed approach does not require any\nparameter tuning to render the desired convergence properties. The paper also\naddresses the extension of the method to the distributed coordination and\ncontrol of multiple robots, where each robot needs to navigate to a goal\nconfiguration while avoiding collisions with the remaining robots, and while\nusing local information only. More specifically, based on the results which\napply to the single-robot case, a motion coordination protocol is presented\nwhich guarantees the safety of the multi-robot system and the almost global\nconvergence of the robots to their goal configurations. The efficacy of the\nproposed methodology is demonstrated via simulation results in static and\ndynamic environments."

    "summary": "This work proposes a method for effectively computing manipulation paths to\nrearrange similar objects in a cluttered space. The solution can be used to\nplace similar products in a factory floor in a desirable arrangement or for\nretrieving a particular object from a shelf blocked by similarly sized objects.\nThese are challenging problems as they involve combinatorially large,\ncontinuous configuration spaces due to the presence of multiple moving bodies\nand kinematically complex manipulators. This work leverages ideas from\nalgorithmic theory, multi-robot motion planning and manipulation planning to\npropose appropriate graphical representations for this challenge. These\nrepresentations allow to quickly reason whether manipulation paths allow the\ntransition between entire sets of objects arrangements without having to\nexplicitly enumerate the path for each pair of arrangements. The proposed\nmethod also allows to take advantage of precomputation given a manipulation\nroadmap for transferring a single object in the same cluttered space. The\nresulting approach is evaluated in simulation for a realistic model of a Baxter\nrobot and executed in open-loop on the real system, showing that the approach\nsolves complex instances and is promising in terms of scalability and success\nratio."

To estimate the current power capability of the\nDams, the statistical information about the water in the dam has to be clear\nand precise. For the purpose of water management monthly or yearly survey of\nthe dams required. One of the important parameter is to find the water level of\nwater, which can help us in finding the pressure and flow of water in dams. The\nexisting surveying systems have some problems, i.e., risky, errors in\nmeasurement and sometimes expensive. Our project has tried a lot to overcome\nthese flaws and to develop more economical, safe and accurate system for\nfinding depth values of dams and ponds. The key purpose of Our Project\nAutonomous Surveying Boat is to have it log water depths along a predefined set\nof points. The Autonomous Surveying Boat floats in water according to\npredefined path, getting the coordinates from GPS Sensor and direction is\ncontrolled by using Magnetometer Sensor. It stores its data on SD card as a\ntext file for later readings. The boat can also be used to find the average\ncapacity of the dam. The average depth is calculated from the measured depth\nvalues at different set points of the dam. The actual length of the dam is\ndetermined by the magnetometer. The numbers of surveys over the time can help\nus in finding the silting ratio in dams.For square dams the length and width of\nthe dam are measured and the average depth, then using these three parameters\nwe can estimate the average capacity of the dam.The boat is scalable for\nfurthered modification if needed."

By using this large sensing area, a robot has the\npotential to acquire useful information from incidental contact that occurs\nwhile performing a task. Within this paper, we demonstrate that data-driven\nmethods can be used to infer mechanical properties of objects from incidental\ncontact with a robot's forearm. We collected data from a tactile-sensing\nforearm as it made contact with various objects during a simple reaching\nmotion. We then used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer two object properties\n(rigid vs. soft and fixed vs. movable) based on low-dimensional features of\ntime-varying tactile sensor data (maximum force, contact area, and contact\nmotion). A key issue is the extent to which data-driven methods can generalize\nto robot actions that differ from those used during training. To investigate\nthis issue, we developed an idealized mechanical model of a robot with a\ncompliant joint making contact with an object. This model provides intuition\nfor the classification problem. We also conducted tests in which we varied the\nrobot arm's velocity and joint stiffness. We found that, in contrast to our\nprevious methods [1], multivariate HMMs achieved high cross-validation accuracy\nand successfully generalized what they had learned to new robot motions with\ndistinct velocities and joint stiffnesses."

The method relies on the\ntransformation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation into a linear\npartial differential equation. This approach allows for optimality criteria to\nbe incorporated into the navigation function, and generalizes several existing\nresults in navigation functions. It is shown that the HJB and that existing\nnavigation functions in the literature sit on ends of a spectrum of\noptimization problems, upon which tradeoffs may be made in problem complexity.\nIn particular, it is shown that under certain criteria the optimal navigation\nfunction is related to Laplace's equation, previously used in the literature,\nthrough an exponential transform. Further, analytical solutions to the HJB are\navailable in simplified domains, yielding guidance towards optimality for\napproximation schemes. Examples are used to illustrate the role that noise, and\noptimality can potentially play in navigation system design."

The generalization capability of the\nproposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the\nsimulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two\nregions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30\ntrials).

In contrast to other works, the proposed approach\ntakes into account impact of the gravity compensator and link weights on the\nmanipulator elastostatic properties. In order to improve the identification\naccuracy, the industry oriented performance measure is used to define optimal\nmeasurement configurations and an enhanced partial pose measurement method is\napplied for the identification of the model parameters. The advantages of the\ndeveloped approach are confirmed by experimental results that deal with the\nelastostatic calibration of a heavy industrial robot used for milling. The\nachieved accuracy improvement factor is about 2.4."

    "summary": "Sampling-based motion-planning algorithms typically rely on nearest-neighbor\n(NN) queries when constructing a roadmap. Recent results suggest that in\nvarious settings NN queries may be the computational bottleneck of such\nalgorithms. Moreover, in several asymptotically-optimal algorithms these NN\nqueries are of a specific form: Given a set of points and a radius r report all\npairs of points whose distance is at most r. This calls for an\napplication-specific NN data structure tailored to efficiently answering this\ntype of queries. Randomly transformed grids (RTG) were recently proposed by\nAiger et al. as a tool to answer such queries and have been shown to outperform\ncommon implementations of NN data structures in this context. In this work we\nemploy RTG for sampling-based motion-planning algorithms and describe an\nefficient implementation of the approach. We show that for motion-planning, RTG\nallow for faster convergence to high-quality solutions when compared with\nexisting NN data structures. Additionally, RTG enable significantly shorter\nconstruction times for batched-PRM variants; specifically, we demonstrate a\nspeedup by a factor of two to three for some scenarios."

The input to our algorithm is a point cloud and the\ngeometric parameters of the robot hand. The output is a set of hand\nconfigurations that are expected to be good grasps. Our key idea is to use\nknowledge of the geometry of a good grasp to improve detection. First, we use a\ngeometrically necessary condition to sample a large set of high quality grasp\nhypotheses. We were surprised to find that using simple geometric conditions\nfor detection can result in a relatively high grasp success rate. Second, we\nuse the notion of an antipodal grasp (a standard characterization of a good two\nfingered grasp) to help us classify these grasp hypotheses. In particular, we\ngenerate a large automatically labeled training set that gives us high\nclassification accuracy. Overall, our method achieves an average grasp success\nrate of 88% when grasping novels objects presented in isolation and an average\nsuccess rate of 73% when grasping novel objects presented in dense clutter.\nThis system is available as a ROS package at http://wiki.ros.org/agile_grasp."

In contrast to previous solutions, the one here\nderived holds even in the case of arbitrary linear and angular speed. This\nsolution is obtained by deriving the analytical expression of any-order moment\nof the probability distribution. To the best of our knowledge, an analytical\nexpression for any-order moment that holds even in the case of arbitrary linear\nand angular speed, has never been derived before. To compute these moments, a\ndirect integration of the Langevin equation is carried out and each moment is\nexpressed as a multiple integral of the deterministic motion (i.e., the known\nmotion that would result in absence of noise). For the special case when the\nratio between the linear and angular speed is constant, the multiple integrals\ncan be easily solved and expressed as the real or the imaginary part of\nsuitable analytic functions. As an application of the derived analytical\nresults, the paper investigates the diffusivity of the considered Brownian\nmotion for constant and for arbitrary time-dependent linear and angular speed."

    "summary": "Humanoid robots locomote by making and breaking contacts with their\nenvironment. A crucial problem is therefore to find precise criteria for a\ngiven contact to remain stable or to break. For rigid surface contacts, the\nmost general criterion is the Contact Wrench Condition (CWC). To check whether\na motion satisfies the CWC, existing approaches take into account a large\nnumber of individual contact forces (for instance, one at each vertex of the\nsupport polygon), which is computationally costly and prevents the use of\nefficient inverse-dynamics methods. Here we argue that the CWC can be\nexplicitly computed without reference to individual contact forces, and give\nclosed-form formulae in the case of rectangular surfaces -- which is of\npractical importance. It turns out that these formulae simply and naturally\nexpress three conditions: (i) Coulomb friction on the resultant force, (ii) ZMP\ninside the support area, and (iii) bounds on the yaw torque. Conditions (i) and\n(ii) are already known, but condition (iii) is, to the best of our knowledge,\nnovel. It is also of particular interest for biped locomotion, where undesired\nfoot yaw rotations are a known issue. We also show that our formulae yield\nsimpler and faster computations than existing approaches for humanoid motions\nin single support, and demonstrate their consistency in the OpenHRP simulator."

However, current motion skill learning methods typically\nrestrict the behavior to a compact, low-dimensional representation, limiting\nits expressiveness and generality. In this paper, we extend a recently\ndeveloped policy search method \\cite{la-lnnpg-14} and use it to learn a range\nof dynamic manipulation behaviors with highly general policy representations,\nwithout using known models or example demonstrations. Our approach learns a set\nof trajectories for the desired motion skill by using iteratively refitted\ntime-varying linear models, and then unifies these trajectories into a single\ncontrol policy that can generalize to new situations. To enable this method to\nrun on a real robot, we introduce several improvements that reduce the sample\ncount and automate parameter selection. We show that our method can acquire\nfast, fluent behaviors after only minutes of interaction time, and can learn\nrobust controllers for complex tasks, including putting together a toy\nairplane, stacking tight-fitting lego blocks, placing wooden rings onto\ntight-fitting pegs, inserting a shoe tree into a shoe, and screwing bottle caps\nonto bottles."

    "summary": "In ergonomics and biomechanics, muscle fatigue models based on maximum\nendurance time (MET) models are often used to integrate fatigue effect into\nergonomic and biomechanical application. However, due to the empirical\nprinciple of those MET models, the disadvantages of this method are: 1) the MET\nmodels cannot reveal the muscle physiology background very well; 2) there is no\ngeneral formation for those MET models to predict MET. In this paper, a\ntheoretical MET model is extended from a simple muscle fatigue model with\nconsideration of the external load and maximum voluntary contraction in passive\nstatic exertion cases. The universal availability of the extended MET model is\nanalyzed in comparison to 24 existing empirical MET models. Using mathematical\nregression method, 21 of the 24 MET models have intraclass correlations over\n0.9, which means the extended MET model could replace the existing MET models\nin a general and computationally efficient way. In addition, an important\nparameter, fatigability (or fatigue resistance) of different muscle groups,\ncould be calculated via the mathematical regression approach. Its mean value\nand its standard deviation are useful for predicting MET values of a given\npopulation during static operations. The possible reasons influencing the\nfatigue resistance were classified and discussed, and it is still a very\nchallenging work to find out the quantitative relationship between the fatigue\nresistance and the influencing factors."

    "summary": "Planning trajectories for nonholonomic systems is difficult and\ncomputationally expensive. When facing unexpected events, it may therefore be\npreferable to deform in some way the initially planned trajectory rather than\nto re-plan entirely a new one. We suggest here a method based on affine\ntransformations to make such deformations. This method is exact and fast: the\ndeformations and the resulting trajectories can be computed algebraically, in\none step, and without any trajectory re-integration. To demonstrate the\npossibilities offered by this new method, we use it to derive position and\norientation correction algorithms for the general class of planar wheeled\nrobots and for a tridimensional underwater vehicle. These algorithms allow in\nturn achieving more complex applications, including obstacle avoidance,\nfeedback control or gap filling for sampling-based kinodynamic planners."

    "summary": "Military is one of many industries that is more computer-dependent than ever\nbefore, from soldiers with computerized weapons, and tactical wireless devices,\nto commanders with advanced battle management, command and control systems.\nFundamentally, command and control is the process of planning, monitoring, and\ncommanding military personnel, weaponry equipment, and combating vehicles to\nexecute military missions. In fact, command and control systems are\nrevolutionizing as war fighting is changing into cyber, technology,\ninformation, and unmanned warfare. As a result, a new design model that\nsupports scalability, reusability, maintainability, survivability, and\ninteroperability is needed to allow commanders, hundreds of miles away from the\nbattlefield, to plan, monitor, evaluate, and control the war events in a\ndynamic, robust, agile, and reliable manner. This paper proposes a\nservice-oriented architecture for weaponry and battle command and control\nsystems, made out of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed\narchitecture consists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that\ncorresponds to any computing military equipment; the server tier that\ncorresponds to the web services that deliver the basic functionalities for the\nclient tier; and the middleware tier that corresponds to an enterprise service\nbus that promotes interoperability between all the interconnected entities. A\ncommand and control system was simulated and experimented and it successfully\nexhibited the desired features of SOA. Future research can improve upon the\nproposed architecture so much so that it supports encryption for securing the\nexchange of data between the various communicating entities of the system."

    "summary": "Currently, industrial sectors are transforming their business processes into\ne-services and component-based architectures to build flexible, robust, and\nscalable systems, and reduce integration-related maintenance and development\ncosts. Robotics is yet another promising and fast-growing industry that deals\nwith the creation of machines that operate in an autonomous fashion and serve\nfor various applications including space exploration, weaponry, laboratory\nresearch, and manufacturing. It is in space exploration that the most common\ntype of robots is the planetary rover which moves across the surface of a\nplanet and conducts a thorough geological study of the celestial surface. This\ntype of rover system is still ad-hoc in that it incorporates its software into\nits core hardware making the whole system cohesive, tightly-coupled, more\nsusceptible to shortcomings, less flexible, hard to be scaled and maintained,\nand impossible to be adapted to other purposes. This paper proposes a\nservice-oriented architecture for space exploration robotic rover systems made\nout of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed architecture\nconsists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that corresponds to the\nactual rover; the server tier that corresponds to the web services; and the\nmiddleware tier that corresponds to an Enterprise Service Bus which promotes\ninteroperability between the interconnected entities. The niche of this\narchitecture is that rover's software components are decoupled and isolated\nfrom the rover's body and possibly deployed at a distant location. A\nservice-oriented architecture promotes integrate-ability, scalability,\nreusability, maintainability, and interoperability for client-to-server\ncommunication."

We would like for non-technical\nhuman owners to be able to communicate, through interaction with their robot,\nthe details of a new task; we call this interaction \"task communication\".\nDuring task communication the robot must infer the details of the task from\nunstructured human signals and it must choose actions that facilitate this\ninference. In this paper we propose the use of a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP) for representing the task communication problem; with\nthe unobservable task details and unobservable intentions of the human teacher\ncaptured in the state, with all signals from the human represented as\nobservations, and with the cost function chosen to penalize uncertainty. We\nwork through an example representation of task communication as a POMDP, and\npresent results from a user experiment on an interactive virtual robot,\ncompared with a human controlled virtual robot, for a task involving a single\nobject movement and binary approval input from the teacher. The results suggest\nthat the proposed POMDP representation produces robots that are robust to\nteacher error, that can accurately infer task details, and that are perceived\nto be intelligent."

    "summary": "Motion planning problems have been studied by both the robotics and the\ncontrols research communities for a long time, and many algorithms have been\ndeveloped for their solution. Among them, incremental sampling-based motion\nplanning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), and the\nProbabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) have become very popular recently, owing to\ntheir implementation simplicity and their advantages in handling\nhigh-dimensional problems. Although these algorithms work very well in\npractice, the quality of the computed solution is often not good, i.e., the\nsolution can be far from the optimal one. A recent variation of RRT, namely the\nRRT* algorithm, bypasses this drawback of the traditional RRT algorithm, by\nensuring asymptotic optimality as the number of samples tends to infinity.\nNonetheless, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may still be slow.\nThis paper presents a new incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm\nbased on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), denoted RRT# (RRT \"sharp\")\nwhich also guarantees asymptotic optimality but, in addition, it also ensures\nthat the constructed spanning tree of the geometric graph is consistent after\neach iteration. In consistent trees, the vertices which have the potential to\nbe part of the optimal solution have the minimum cost-come-value. This implies\nthat the best possible solution is readily computed if there are some vertices\nin the current graph that are already in the goal region. Numerical results\ncompare with the RRT* algorithm."

Our method relies on\nthe communication capabilities of the robots to guarantee correctness and\nmaintain performance during deployment. After computing a set of optimal\nsatisfying paths for the members of the team, we also compute a set of\nsynchronization sequences for each robot to ensure that the LTL formula is\nnever violated during deployment.

In contrast to these existing works\nin cooperative localization, we propose a cooperative localization method,\nwhich we call mutual localization, that uses reciprocal observations of\ncamera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually\nobservable world landmarks. We formulate and solve an algebraic formulation for\nthe pose of the two camera mutual localization setup under these assumptions.\nOur experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free\ncooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2cm range and\n0.7 degree accuracy at 2m sensing for 6-DOF pose. To demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we\ncompare our results with ARToolKit and Bundler, over which our method achieves\na 10 fold improvement in translation estimation accuracy."

This hand was designed to address the need for a durable,\ninexpensive, moderately dexterous hand suitable for use on mobile robots. The\nprimary focus of this paper will be on the novel minimalistic design of i-HY,\nwhich was developed by choosing a set of target tasks around which the design\nof the hand was optimized. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of\nunderactuated fingers that are capable of both firm power grasps and low-\nstiffness fingertip grasps using only the passive mechanics of the finger\nmechanism. Experimental results demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range\nof target objects, the stability of fingertip grasping, as well as the ability\nto adjust the force exerted on grasped objects using the passive finger\nmechanics."

An\nalgorithm for informative path planning is presented that leverages tools from\ninformation theory and formal control synthesis, and is proven to give a path\nthat satisfies the given temporal logic constraints.

    "summary": "This paper presents a DSL for geometric relations between rigid bodies such\nas relative position, orientation, pose, linear velocity, angular velocity, and\ntwist. The DSL is the formal model of the recently proposed semantics for the\nstandardization of geometric relations between rigid bodies, referred to as\n`geometric semantics'. This semantics explicitly states the\ncoordinate-invariant properties and operations, and, more importantly, all the\nchoices that are made in coordinate representations of these geometric\nrelations. This results in a set of concrete suggestions for standardizing\nterminology and notation, allowing programmers to write fully unambiguous\nsoftware interfaces, including automatic checks for semantic correctness of all\ngeometric operations on rigid-body coordinate representations.\n  The DSL is implemented in two different ways: an external DSL in Xcore and an\ninternal DSL in Prolog. Besides defining a grammar and operations, the DSL also\nimplements constraints. In the Xcore model, the Object Constraint Language\nlanguage is used, while in the Prolog model, the constraint are natively\nmodelled in Prolog.\n  This paper discusses the implemented DSL and the tools developed on top of\nthis DSL. In particular an editor, checking the semantic constraints and\nproviding semantic meaningful errors during editing is proposed."

    "summary": "We begin this paper by presenting our approach to robot manipulation, which\nemphasizes the benefits of making contact with the world across the entire\nmanipulator. We assume that low contact forces are benign, and focus on the\ndevelopment of robots that can control their contact forces during\ngoal-directed motion. Inspired by biology, we assume that the robot has\nlow-stiffness actuation at its joints, and tactile sensing across the entire\nsurface of its manipulator. We then describe a novel controller that exploits\nthese assumptions. The controller only requires haptic sensing and does not\nneed an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It also handles\nmultiple contacts across the surface of the manipulator. The controller uses\nmodel predictive control (MPC) with a time horizon of length one, and a linear\nquasi-static mechanical model that it constructs at each time step. We show\nthat this controller enables both real and simulated robots to reach goal\nlocations in high clutter with low contact forces. Our experiments include\ntests using a real robot with a novel tactile sensor array on its forearm\nreaching into simulated foliage and a cinder block. In our experiments, robots\nmade contact across their entire arms while pushing aside movable objects,\ndeforming compliant objects, and perceiving the world."

    "summary": "In this paper, we extend the recent body of work on planning under\nuncertainty to include the fact that sensors may not provide any measurement\nowing to misdetection. This is caused either by adverse environmental\nconditions that prevent the sensors from making measurements or by the\nfundamental limitations of the sensors. Examples include RF-based ranging\ndevices that intermittently do not receive the signal from beacons because of\nobstacles; the misdetection of features by a camera system in detrimental\nlighting conditions; a LIDAR sensor that is pointed at a glass-based material\nsuch as a window, etc.\n  The main contribution of this paper is twofold. We first show that it is\npossible to obtain an analytical bound on the performance of a state estimator\nunder sensor misdetection occurring stochastically over time in the\nenvironment. We then show how this bound can be used in a sample-based path\nplanning algorithm to produce a path that trades off accuracy and robustness.\nComputational results demonstrate the benefit of the approach and comparisons\nare made with the state of the art in path planning under state uncertainty."

Particular attention is devoted to\ngoals that become feasible only if a subset of the safety rules are violated.\nThe proposed algorithm computes a control law, that minimizes the level of\nunsafety while the desired goal is guaranteed to be reached. This problem is\nmotivated by an autonomous car navigating an urban environment while following\nrules of the road such as \"always travel in right lane'' and \"do not change\nlanes frequently''.

They have important theoretical benefits but have never been\nimplemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time\ncomputation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present an\nexperimental evaluation of these algorithms in the context of balance control\nfor a humanoid robot. The presented experiments demonstrate the applicability\nof the approach under real robot conditions (i.e. model uncertainty, estimation\nerrors, etc). We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that\nallows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque\ncontrol loop. We implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows\nrobust performance in face of unknown disturbances, even when the robot is\nstanding on only one foot. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated\nto demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated\nhierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers\ncan be used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based\nbalance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot."

Finally, we give a simple control law allowing to\nsafely navigate into homotopy classes \\emph{under kinodynamic constraints} even\nin the presence of unexpected events, such as a sudden robot deceleration\nwithout notice.

    "summary": "In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning\nalgorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is\nspecifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in\nhigh-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be\nasymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster\nthan its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*\nalgorithm performs a \"lazy\" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined\nnumber of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves\nsteadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis\napproaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*\nalgorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra\nmathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate\nbounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.\nSpecifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration\nspaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\\rho})$, where\n$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration\nspace, and $\\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate\nasymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the\nconfiguration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,\nand when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead\nof a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions\nand obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by\nshowing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better\nsolutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional\nconfiguration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive."

The investigation and testing of\nremote surgery using a robotic arm is presented. The robotic arm is designed to\nhave four degrees of freedom that track the surgeon's x, y, z positions and the\nrotation angle of the forearm {\\theta}. The system comprises two main\nsubsystems viz. the detecting and actuating systems. The detection system uses\ninfrared light-emitting diodes, a retroreflective bracelet and two infrared\ncameras which as a whole determine the coordinates of the surgeon's forearm.\nThe actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which\ncan obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the\nend-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6\nmm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate\nprecisely. The surgeon is able to monitor the patient with the use of a\ngraphical user interface on the display computer. The lead screw system is\nmodelled and compared to experimentation results. The system is controlled\nusing a simple proportional-integrator (PI) control scheme which is implemented\non a dSpace control unit. The control design results in a rise time of less\nthan 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less\nthan 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error\nof approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm.

A camera mounted on the ceiling of the room, gives a\ntop-down view of the obstacles, the person and the nightstand. Pressure sensors\nmounted beneath the bed-stand of the individual provide physical perception of\nthe person's state. A proximity IR sensor on the nightstand acts as a tactile\ninterface along with a Wii Nunchuck (Nintendo) to control mundane operations on\nthe nightstand. Intelligence from these three modalities are combined to enable\npath planning for the nightstand to approach the individual. With growing\nemphasis on assistive technology for the aging individuals who are increasingly\nelecting to stay in their homes, we show how ubiquitous intelligence can be\nbrought inside homes to help monitor and provide care to an individual. Our\napproach goes one step towards achieving pervasive intelligence by seamlessly\nintegrating different sensors embedded in the fabric of the environment."

Such problem can be of interest for search and rescue\nmissions in post disaster scenario where the autonomous agent can be used for\nremote monitoring and first hand knowledge of the aftermath, while the mobile\nrobots can be used to provide the agent the possibility to dynamically send its\ncollected information to an external base station. To study the problem, a\ndistributed multi-robot system with wifi communication capabilities has been\ndeveloped and used to implement a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) to guarantee\nthe required multi-hop communication. None of the robots of the team possess\nthe knowledge of agent's movement, neither they hold a pre-assigned position in\nthe ad-hoc network but they adapt with respect to the dynamic environmental\nsituations. This adaptation only requires the robots to have the knowledge of\ntheir position and the possibility to exchange such information with their\none-hop neighbours. Robots' motion is achieved by implementing a behavioural\ncontrol, namely the Null-Space based Behavioural control, embedding the\ncollective mission to achieve the required self-configuration. Validation of\nthe approach is performed by means of demanding experimental tests involving\nfive ground mobile robots capable of self localization and dynamic obstacle\navoidance."

A 3D point cloud\nregistration technique is exploited to merge the successively created maps\nduring the robot's motion followed by an ICP refinement step.

The main characteristic of the path planner is that the robot's\nembodiment is considered for producing detailed and safe trajectories of $1$\n$cm$ resolution. The proposed method has been evaluated with our mobile robot\nin several outdoor scenarios revealing remarkable performance."

    "summary": "Two challenges for rescue robots are to detect human beings and to have an\naccurate positioning system. In indoor positioning, GPS receivers cannot be\nused due to the reflections or attenuation caused by obstacles. To detect human\nbeings, sensors such as thermal camera, ultrasonic and microphone can be\nembedded on the rescue robot. The drawback of these sensors is the detection\nrange. These sensors have to be in close proximity to the victim in order to\ndetect it. UWB technology is then very helpful to ensure precise localization\nof the rescue robot inside the disaster site and detect human beings.\n  We propose a new method to both detect human beings and locate the rescue\nrobot at the same time. To achieve these goals we optimize the design of UWB\npulses based on B-splines. The spectral effectiveness is optimized so the\nsymbols are easier to detect and the mitigation with noise is reduced. Our\npositioning system performs to locate the rescue robot with an accuracy about 2\ncentimeters. During some tests we discover that UWB signal characteristics\nabruptly change after passing through a human body. Our system uses this\nparticular signature to detect human body."

A domain-specific\nlanguage is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain\nthat offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer\nproductivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a\nhigh-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at\nthe right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for\nprogramming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a\nseparate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a\nholistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,\nuncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional\ngeneral-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language\nfeatures and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,\nsystematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and\nprecisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the\nrobotics domain."

Unfortunately, despite the availability of several robotics\nmiddleware services, robotics software still fails to smoothly handle at least\ntwo kinds of variability: algorithmic variability and lower-level variability.\nThe consequence is that implementations of algorithms are hard to understand\nand impacted by changes to lower-level details such as the choice or\nconfiguration of sensors or actuators. Moreover, when several algorithms or\nalgorithmic variants are available it is difficult to compare and combine them.\n  In order to alleviate these problems we propose a top-down approach to\nexpress and implement robotics algorithms and families of algorithms so that\nthey are both less dependent on lower-level details and easier to understand\nand combine. This approach goes top-down from the algorithms and shields them\nfrom lower-level details by introducing very high level abstractions atop the\nintermediate abstractions of robotics middleware. This approach is illustrated\non 7 variants of the Bug family that were implemented using both laser and\ninfra-red sensors."

    "summary": "Frictional influences in tendon-driven robotic systems are generally\nunwanted, with efforts towards minimizing them where possible. In the human\nhand however, the tendon-pulley system is found to be frictional with a\ndifference between high-loaded static post-eccentric and post-concentric force\nproduction of 9-12% of the total output force. This difference can be directly\nattributed to tendon-pulley friction. Exploiting this phenomenon for robotic\nand prosthetic applications we can achieve a reduction of actuator size, weight\nand consequently energy consumption. In this study, we present the design of a\nbio-inspired friction switch. The adaptive pulley is designed to minimize the\ninfluence of frictional forces under low and medium-loading conditions and\nmaximize it under high-loading conditions. This is achieved with a\ndual-material system that consists of a high-friction silicone substrate and\nlow-friction polished steel pins. The system, designed to switch its frictional\nproperties between the low-loaded and high-loaded conditions, is described and\nits behavior experimentally validated with respect to the number and spacing of\npins. The results validate its intended behavior, making it a viable choice for\nrobotic tendon-driven systems."

    "summary": "Bipedal locomotion is a phenomenon that still eludes a fundamental and\nconcise mathematical understanding. Conceptual models that capture some\nrelevant aspects of the process exist but their full explanatory power is not\nyet exhausted. In the current study, we introduce the robustness criterion\nwhich defines the conditions for stable locomotion when steps are taken with\nimprecise angle of attack. Intuitively, the necessity of a higher precision\nindicates the difficulty to continue moving with a given gait. We show that the\nspring-loaded inverted pendulum model, under the robustness criterion, is\nconsistent with previously reported findings on attentional demand during human\nlocomotion. This criterion allows transitions between running and walking, many\nof which conserve forward speed. Simulations of transitions predict Froude\nnumbers below the ones observed in humans, nevertheless the model\nsatisfactorily reproduces several biomechanical indicators such as hip\nexcursion, gait duty factor and vertical ground reaction force profiles.\nFurthermore, we identify reversible robust walk-run transitions, which allow\nthe system to execute a robust version of the hopping gait. These findings\nfoster the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model as the unifying framework for\nthe understanding of bipedal locomotion."

The only known solution for defining\nsuch trajectory is to encircle a cusp point in the joint space. In this paper,\nthe aspects and the characteristic surfaces are computed for each operation\nmode to define the uniqueness of the domains. Thus, we can easily see in the\nworkspace that at least three assembly modes can be reached for each operation\nmode. To validate this property, the mathematical analysis of the determinant\nof the Jacobian is done. The image of these trajectories in the joint space is\ndepicted with the curves associated with the cusp points."

    "summary": "Motion planning under differential constraints is a classic problem in\nrobotics. To date, the state of the art is represented by sampling-based\ntechniques, with the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm as a leading\nexample. Yet, the problem is still open in many aspects, including guarantees\non the quality of the obtained solution. In this paper we provide a thorough\ntheoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based\nalgorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this\nframework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are\nguaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal\nsolution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the\nDifferential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless\ncontrol-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of\nrobotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability\n(as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility\nof this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of\noptimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints.\nNumerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and\ndiscussed."

Particularly, we consider that the task specification\ntakes a form of a linear temporal logic formula, which may contain requirements\nand constraints on the other agent's behavior. A traditional automata-based\napproach to multi-agent strategy synthesis from such specifications builds on\ncentralized planning for the whole team and thus suffers from extreme\ncomputational demands. In this work, we aim at reducing the computational\ncomplexity by decomposing the strategy synthesis problem into short horizon\nplanning problems that are solved iteratively, upon the run of the agents.

    "summary": "Motion planning has been studied for nearly four decades now. Complete,\ncombinatorial motion planning approaches are theoretically well-rooted with\ncompleteness guarantees but they are hard to implement. Sampling-based and\nheuristic methods are easy to implement and quite simple to customize but they\nlack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved,\nparticularly for mission critical applications such as robotic surgery, space\nexplorations, and handling hazardous material? In this paper, we answer\naffirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology, NUROA, to\nnumerically approximate the Canny's roadmap, which is a network of\none-dimensional algebraic curves. Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a\nchain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose\nconnectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the\nentire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all\nsides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are\ndetected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all\nremaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input\nor automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation\nis cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is\nin turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the\nLasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA\ncorrectly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas\ncompetitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases. Since boxes are\nindependent from one another, NUROA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs.\nNUROA is available as an open source package at http://nuroa.sourceforge.net/."

An advantage of our approach is that\nin many cases (especially as the number of samples grows) the weight of\ncollision detection in the computation is almost negligible with respect to\nnearest-neighbor calls. We prove that MPLB performs no more collision-detection\ncalls than an anytime version of FMT*.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is\nbecoming a popular approach to acquire a nonlinear optimal policy through trial\nand error. However, it is considered very difficult to apply RL to real robot\ncontrol since it usually requires many learning trials. Such trials cannot be\nexecuted in real environments because unrealistic time is necessary and the\nreal system's durability is limited. Therefore, in this study, instead of\nexecuting many learning trials, we propose to use a recently developed RL\nalgorithm, importance-weighted PGPE, by which the robot can efficiently reuse\npreviously sampled data to improve it's policy parameters. We apply\nimportance-weighted PGPE to CB-i, our real humanoid robot, and show that it can\nlearn a target reaching movement and a cart-pole swing up movement in a real\nenvironment without using any prior knowledge of the task or any carefully\ndesigned initial trajectory."

The purpose of this\npaper is to show that asymptotically optimal motion planning for dynamical\nsystems with differential constraints can be achieved without the use of a\nsteering function. We develop a novel analysis on sampling-based planning\nalgorithms that sample the control space. This analysis demonstrated that\nasymptotically optimal path planning for any Lipschitz continuous dynamical\nsystem can be achieved by sampling the control space directly. We also\ndetermine theoretical bounds on the convergence rates for this class of\nalgorithms.

The push\nrecovery capability grows with age (a child has poor push recovery than an\nadult) and it is based on learning. A wrestler, for example, has better push\nrecovery than an ordinary man. However, the mechanism of reactive push recovery\nis not known to us. We tried to understand the human learning mechanism by\nconducting several experiments. The subjects for the experiments were selected\nboth as right handed and left handed. Pushes were induced from the behind with\nclose eyes to observe the motor action as well as with open eyes to observe\nlearning based reactive behaviors. Important observations show that the left\nhanded and right handed persons negotiate pushes differently (in opposite\nmanner). The present research describes some details about the experiments and\nthe analyses of the results mainly obtained from the joint angle variations\n(both for ankle and hip joints) as the manifestation of perturbation. After\nsmoothening the captured data through higher order polynomials, we feed them to\nour model which was developed exploiting the physics of an inverted pendulum\nand configured it as a representative of the subjects in the Webot simulation\nframework available in our laboratory. In each cases the model also could\nrecover from the push for the same rage of perturbation which proves the\ncorrectness of the model.

    "summary": "Building trajectories for biped robot walking is a complex task considering\nall degrees of freedom (DOFs) commonly bound within the mechanical structure. A\ntypical problem for such robots is the instability produced by violent\ntransitions between walking phases in particular when a swinging leg impacts\nthe surface. Although extensive research on novel efficient walking algorithms\nhas been conducted, falls commonly appear as the walking speed increases or as\nthe terrain condition changes. This paper presents a polynomial trajectory\ngeneration algorithm (PTA) to implement the walking on biped robots following\nthe cubic Hermitian polynomial interpolation between initial and final\nconditions. The proposed algorithm allows smooth transitions between walking\nphases, significantly reducing the possibility of falling. The algorithm has\nbeen successfully tested by generating walking trajectories under different\nterrain conditions on a biped robot of 10 DOFs. PTA has shown to be simple and\nsuitable to generate real time walking trajectories, despite reduced computing\nresources of a commercial embedded microcontroller. Experimental evidence and\ncomparisons to other state-of-the-art methods demonstrates a better performance\nof the proposed method in generating walking trajectories under different\nground conditions."

    "summary": "In this paper we provide a thorough, rigorous theoretical framework to assess\noptimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for drift control systems:\nsystems that, loosely speaking, can not stop instantaneously due to momentum.\nWe exploit this framework to design and analyze a sampling-based algorithm (the\nDifferential Fast Marching Tree algorithm) that is asymptotically optimal, that\nis, it is guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an\noptimal solution. In addition, our approach allows us to provide concrete\nbounds on the rate of this convergence. The focus of this paper is on mixed\ntime/control energy cost functions and on linear affine dynamical systems,\nwhich encompass a range of models of interest to applications (e.g.,\ndouble-integrators) and represent a necessary step to design, via successive\nlinearization, sampling-based and provably-correct algorithms for non-linear\ndrift control systems. Our analysis relies on an original perturbation analysis\nfor two-point boundary value problems, which could be of independent interest."

    "summary": "Robots operating in domestic environments generally need to interact with\narticulated objects, such as doors, cabinets, dishwashers or fridges. In this\nwork, we present a novel, probabilistic framework for modeling articulated\nobjects as kinematic graphs. Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts,\nwhile edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we\npresent a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models and how they can\nrobustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how\nto estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models\nfor pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how\nthe learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In\nvarious experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as\nin simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient.\nFurther, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in\nparticular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics."

    "summary": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence techniques have emerged as useful\ntools for solving various engineering problems that were not possible or\nconvenient to handle by traditional methods. AI has directly influenced many\nareas of computer science and becomes an important part of the engineering\ncurriculum. However, determining the important topics for a single semester AI\ncourse is a nontrivial task, given the lack of a general methodology. AI\nconcepts commonly overlap with many other disciplines involving a wide range of\nsubjects, including applied approaches to more formal mathematical issues. This\npaper presents the use of a simple robotic platform to assist the learning of\nbasic AI concepts. The study is guided through some simple experiments using\nautonomous mobile robots. The central algorithm is the Learning Automata. Using\nLA, each robot action is applied to an environment to be evaluated by means of\na fitness value. The response of the environment is used by the automata to\nselect its next action. This procedure holds until the goal task is reached.\nThe proposal addresses the AI study by offering in LA a unifying context to\ndraw together several of the topics of AI and motivating the students to learn\nby building some hands on laboratory exercises. The presented material has been\nsuccessfully tested as AI teaching aide in the University of Guadalajara\nrobotics group as it motivates students and increases enrolment and retention\nwhile educating better computer engineers."

Many strategies have\nbeen proposed to alleviate this problem, most of them based on biasing the\nsampling distribution. When kinematic constraints appear in the problem, the\nconfiguration space typically becomes a non-parametrizable, implicit manifold.\nUnfortunately, this invalidates most of the existing sampling bias approaches,\nwhich rely on an explicit parametrization of the space to explore.

    "summary": "Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for\nhigh-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random\ngeometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved\nwith these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics\nrequires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of\nthe underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,\nto generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots\nor physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even\npossible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without\naccess to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how\nto achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental\nsampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new\nmethods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are\nasymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown\nto converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set\nof samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of\nthe planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems\nbenchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots."

The approach is especially suited for large\nconfiguration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those\nfound with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using\nprobabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which\nprovides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space,\nmaking storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with\nrespect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past\nexperience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in\nindividual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more\nopportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of\nthe experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of\ndynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing\nquery resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom\nhumanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based\nplanner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments\nwith variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that\nThunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning\nfrom scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8% less memory to store its experiences\nafter 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented\nand freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library."

Our final claim is that, for\nfully-actuated robots, computing the operational-space inverse dynamics is\nequivalent to computing the inverse kinematics (at acceleration level) and then\nthe joint-space inverse dynamics. Thanks to this fact, our control framework\ncan efficiently compute the optimal solution by decoupling kinematics and\ndynamics of the robot.

For the\ngeneral algorithm, we need a method to map the whole maze, which is required if\nthe maze is complex. The proposed maze mapping system is based on coordinate\nsystem and after mapping the whole maze as a graph in standard 'Adjacency-list\nrepresentation' method, shortest path and shortest time path was extracted\nusing Dijkstra's algorithm. In order to find the coordinates of the turning\npoints and junctions, linear distance between the points are needed, for which\nwheel encoder was used. However, due to non-linear movement of robot, the\ndirectly measured distance from the encoder has some error and to remove this\nerror an idea is built up which ended by deriving equations that gives us\nalmost exact linear distance between two points from the reading of wheel\nencoder of the robot moving in a non-linear path."

    "summary": "Identification of inertial parameters is fundamental for the implementation\nof torque-based control in humanoids. At the same time, good models of friction\nand actuator dynamics are critical for the low-level control of joint torques.\nWe propose a novel method to identify inertial, friction and motor parameters\nin a single procedure. The identification exploits the measurements of the PWM\nof the DC motors and a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted inside the kinematic\nchain. The partial least-square (PLS) method is used to perform the regression.\nWe identified the inertial, friction and motor parameters of the right arm of\nthe iCub humanoid robot. We verified that the identified model can accurately\npredict the force/torque sensor measurements and the motor voltages. Moreover,\nwe compared the identified parameters against the CAD parameters, in the\nprediction of the force/torque sensor measurements. Finally, we showed that the\nestimated model can effectively detect external contacts, comparing it against\na tactile-based contact detection. The presented approach offers some\nadvantages with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, because of its\ncompleteness (i.e. it identifies inertial, friction and motor parameters) and\nsimplicity (only one data collection, with no particular requirements)."

    "summary": "This paper presents a new technique to control highly redundant mechanical\nsystems, such as humanoid robots. We take inspiration from two approaches.\nPrioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and\nanimation: tasks have strict priorities and they are satisfied only as long as\nthey do not conflict with any higher-priority task. Optimal control instead\nformulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control\npolicy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict\npriorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to\nweighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the\nrespect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning\nissues. We compared our approach with both prioritized control and optimal\ncontrol with tests on a simulated robot with 11 degrees of freedom."

The structure of the constraints of the problem (i.e. the dynamics\nof the robot) allows us to find a sparse analytical solution. This leads to an\nequivalent optimization with reduced computational complexity, comparable to\ninverse-dynamics based approaches.

Given the start and destination position for each\nof the robots, the task is to find trajectories for all robots that reach their\ndestinations with minimum total cost such that the robots will not collide when\nfollowing the found trajectories. Our approach starts from individually optimal\ntrajectory for each robot, which are then penalized for being in collision with\nother robots. The penalty is gradually increased and the individual\ntrajectories are iteratively replanned to account for the increased penalty\nuntil a collision-free solution is found. Using extensive experimental\nevaluation, we find that such a penalty method constructs trajectories with\nnear-optimal cost on the instances where the optimum is known and otherwise\nwith 4-10 % lower cost than the trajectories generated by prioritized planning\nand up to 40 % cheaper than trajectories generated by local collision avoidance\ntechniques, such as ORCA."

In this paper, we\nconsider such information for robot grasping by leveraging manifolds and\nsymbolic object parts. Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic logic\nmodule to first semantically reason about pre-grasp configurations with respect\nto the intended tasks. Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual\nfeatures to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of\nobject-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that\ngeneralize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of\nprobabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current\napproaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to\ntask-dependent grasping points.

We\nshow that using our approach, quadrotors are able to successfully avoid\npairwise collisions in GPS and motion-capture denied environments, without\ncommunication between the quadrotors, and even when human operators\ndeliberately attempt to induce collisions. To our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that reciprocal collision avoidance has been successfully implemented on\nreal robots where each agent independently observes the others using on-board\nsensors. We theoretically analyze the response of the collision-avoidance\nalgorithm to the violated assumptions by the use of real robots. We\nquantitatively analyze our experimental results. A particularly striking\nobservation is that at times the quadrotors exhibit \"reciprocal dance\"\nbehavior, which is also observed when humans move past each other in\nconstrained environments. This seems to be the result of sensing uncertainty,\nwhich causes both robots involved to have a different belief about the relative\npositions and velocities and, as a result, choose the same side on which to\npass."

    "summary": "Path-velocity decomposition is an intuitive yet powerful approach to address\nthe complexity of kinodynamic motion planning. The difficult trajectory\nplanning problem is solved in two separate, simpler, steps: first, find a path\nin the configuration space that satisfies the geometric constraints (path\nplanning), and second, find a time-parameterization of that path satisfying the\nkinodynamic constraints. A fundamental requirement is that the path found in\nthe first step should be time-parameterizable. Most existing works fulfill this\nrequirement by enforcing quasi-static constraints in the path planning step,\nresulting in an important loss in completeness. We propose a method that\nenables path-velocity decomposition to discover truly dynamic motions, i.e.\nmotions that are not quasi-statically executable. At the heart of the proposed\nmethod is a new algorithm -- Admissible Velocity Propagation -- which, given a\npath and an interval of reachable velocities at the beginning of that path,\ncomputes exactly and efficiently the interval of all the velocities the system\ncan reach after traversing the path while respecting the system kinodynamic\nconstraints. Combining this algorithm with usual sampling-based planners then\ngives rise to a family of new trajectory planners that can appropriately handle\nkinodynamic constraints while retaining the advantages associated with\npath-velocity decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nmethod on some difficult kinodynamic planning problems, where, in particular,\nquasi-static methods are guaranteed to fail."

This solution has been\nsuccessfully adopted to cover various humanoid robots. The main limitation of\nthis and all the approaches based on capacitive technology is that they require\nto embed a deformable dielectric layer (usually made using an elastomer)\ncovered by a conductive layer.

    "summary": "In this paper, we revisit batch state estimation through the lens of Gaussian\nprocess (GP) regression. We consider continuous-discrete estimation problems\nwherein a trajectory is viewed as a one-dimensional GP, with time as the\nindependent variable. Our continuous-time prior can be defined by any\nnonlinear, time-varying stochastic differential equation driven by white noise;\nthis allows the possibility of smoothing our trajectory estimates using a\nvariety of vehicle dynamics models (e.g., `constant-velocity'). We show that\nthis class of prior results in an inverse kernel matrix (i.e., covariance\nmatrix between all pairs of measurement times) that is exactly sparse\n(block-tridiagonal) and that this can be exploited to carry out GP regression\n(and interpolation) very efficiently. When the prior is based on a linear,\ntime-varying stochastic differential equation and the measurement model is also\nlinear, this GP approach is equivalent to classical, discrete-time smoothing\n(at the measurement times); when a nonlinearity is present, we iterate over the\nwhole trajectory to maximize accuracy. We test the approach experimentally on a\nsimultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping problem using a mobile robot\ndataset."

Trajectory tracking is implemented by formulating the\ntrajectory of the quadcopter using its jerk, in discrete time, and then solving\na convex optimization problem on each decoupled axis. Based on the maximum\npossible thrust and angular rates of the quadcopter, feasibility constraints\nfor the quadcopter have been derived. In this report we describe the design and\nimplementation of explicit MPC controllers where the controllers were executed\non a computer using sparse solvers to control the vehicle in hovering flight."

Within this\nclass of algorithms, many variants have been proposed over the last 20 years,\nyet there is still no characterization of which algorithms are well-suited for\nwhich classes of problems. This has motivated us to develop a benchmarking\ninfrastructure for motion planning algorithms. It consists of three main\ncomponents. First, we have created an extensive benchmarking software framework\nthat is included with the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), a C++ library\nthat contains implementations of many sampling-based algorithms.

    "summary": "Rigid bodies, plastic impact, persistent contact, Coulomb friction, and\nmassless limbs are ubiquitous simplifications introduced to reduce the\ncomplexity of mechanics models despite the obvious physical inaccuracies that\neach incurs individually. In concert, it is well known that the interaction of\nsuch idealized approximations can lead to conflicting and even paradoxical\nresults. As robotics modeling moves from the consideration of isolated\nbehaviors to the analysis of tasks requiring their composition, a\nmathematically tractable framework for building models that combine these\nsimple approximations yet achieve reliable results is overdue. In this paper we\npresent a formal hybrid dynamical system model that introduces suitably\nrestricted compositions of these familiar abstractions with the guarantee of\nconsistency analogous to global existence and uniqueness in classical dynamical\nsystems. The hybrid system developed here provides a discontinuous but\nself-consistent approximation to the continuous (though possibly very stiff and\nfast) dynamics of a physical robot undergoing intermittent impacts. The\nmodeling choices sacrifice some quantitative numerical efficiencies while\nmaintaining qualitatively correct and analytically tractable results with\nconsistency guarantees promoting their use in formal reasoning about mechanism,\nfeedback control, and behavior design in robots that make and break contact\nwith their environment."

    "summary": "A reactive obstacle avoidance method for mobile manipulators is presented.\nThe objectives of the developed algorithm are twofold. The first one is to find\na trajectory in the configuration space of a mobile manipulator so as to follow\na given trajectory in the task space. The second objective consists in locally\nadjusting the trajectory in the configuration space in order to avoid\ncollisions with potentially moving obstacles and self-collisions in\nunstructured and dynamic environments. The perception is exclusively based on a\nset of proximity sensors distributed on the robot mechanical structure and\nvisual information are not required. Thanks to the adoption of this kind of\nproximity distributed perception, the approach does not require a 3D model of\nthe robot and allows the real-time collision avoidance without the need of a\nsensorized environment. To achieve the features cited above, a behaviour-based\ntechnique known as Null-Space-Based (NSB) approach has been adopted with some\nmodifications.On one hand, the concept of a total pseudo-energy based on the\ninformation from the distributed sensors has been introduced. On the other\nhand, a method to combine different tasks has been proposed to guarantee the\nsmoothness of the realtime trajectory adjustments. Another significant feature\nof the method is the strict coordination between the base and the arm\nexploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, that is a relevant topic in mobile\nmanipulation."

    "summary": "We have built a 12DOF, passive-compliant legged, tailed biped actuated by\nfour brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied\nmodes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion\ntasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping,\nand more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated\nbody, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our\ninterest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a\nrelatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of\navailable choices. Here we report on the development of one important example\nof such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal\nsagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF\nbase controllers.\n  For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is\nfastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's\nlocomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in\nflight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape\nin flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance.\nThe motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four\nsimple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in\nisolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these\nabstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific\ncomponent of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of\ncorrectness for this parallel composition of template reference systems along\nwith data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are anchored as\nevidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably\ntransformed image of traces from the physical platform."

    "summary": "This work proposes a control law for a manipulator with the aim of realizing\ndesired time-varying motion-force profiles in the presence of a stiff\nenvironment. In many cases, the interaction with the environment affects only\none degree of freedom of the end-effector of the manipulator. Therefore, the\nfocus is on this contact degree of freedom, and a switching position-force\ncontroller is proposed to perform the hybrid position-force tracking task.\nSufficient conditions are presented to guarantee input-to-state stability of\nthe switching closed-loop system with respect to perturbations related to the\ntime-varying desired motion-force profile. The switching occurs when the\nmanipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows\nthat to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying\nmotion-force profiles, the controller should implement a considerable (and\noften unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking\nperformance. Therefore, we propose to redesign the manipulator with a compliant\nwrist. Guidelines are provided for the design of the compliant wrist while\nemploying the designed switching control strategy, such that stable tracking of\na motion-force reference trajectory can be achieved and bouncing of the\nmanipulator while making contact with the stiff environment can be avoided.\nFinally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe approach."

    "summary": "Natural language offers an intuitive and flexible means for humans to\ncommunicate with the robots that we will increasingly work alongside in our\nhomes and workplaces. Recent advancements have given rise to robots that are\nable to interpret natural language manipulation and navigation commands, but\nthese methods require a prior map of the robot's environment. In this paper, we\npropose a novel learning framework that enables robots to successfully follow\nnatural language route directions without any previous knowledge of the\nenvironment. The algorithm utilizes spatial and semantic information that the\nhuman conveys through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and\nsemantic properties of spatially extended environments. Our method uses this\ndistribution in place of the latent world model and interprets the natural\nlanguage instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior. A novel\nbelief space planner reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions\nto solve for a policy using imitation learning. We evaluate our framework on a\nvoice-commandable wheelchair. The results demonstrate that by learning and\nperforming inference over a latent environment model, the algorithm is able to\nsuccessfully follow natural language route directions within novel, extended\nenvironments."

    "summary": "Robot teleoperation systems face a common set of challenges including\nlatency, low-dimensional user commands, and asymmetric control inputs. User\ncontrol with Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exacerbates these problems\nthrough especially noisy and erratic low-dimensional motion commands due to the\ndifficulty in decoding neural activity. We introduce a general framework to\naddress these challenges through a combination of computer vision, user intent\ninference, and arbitration between the human input and autonomous control\nschemes. Adjustable levels of assistance allow the system to balance the\noperator's capabilities and feelings of comfort and control while compensating\nfor a task's difficulty. We present experimental results demonstrating\nsignificant performance improvement using the shared-control assistance\nframework on adapted rehabilitation benchmarks with two subjects implanted with\nintracortical brain-computer interfaces controlling a seven degree-of-freedom\nrobotic manipulator as a prosthetic. Our results further indicate that shared\nassistance mitigates perceived user difficulty and even enables successful\nperformance on previously infeasible tasks. We showcase the extensibility of\nour architecture with applications to quality-of-life tasks such as opening a\ndoor, pouring liquids from containers, and manipulation with novel objects in\ndensely cluttered environments."

    "summary": "For robots to be able to manipulate in unknown and unstructured environments\nthe robot should be capable of operating under partial observability of the\nenvironment. Object occlusions and unmodeled environments are some of the\nfactors that result in partial observability. A common scenario where this is\nencountered is manipulation in clutter. In the case that the robot needs to\nlocate an object of interest and manipulate it, it needs to perform a series of\ndecluttering actions to accurately detect the object of interest. To perform\nsuch a series of actions, the robot also needs to account for the dynamics of\nobjects in the environment and how they react to contact. This is a non trivial\nproblem since one needs to reason not only about robot-object interactions but\nalso object-object interactions in the presence of contact. In the example\nscenario of manipulation in clutter, the state vector would have to account for\nthe pose of the object of interest and the structure of the surrounding\nenvironment. The process model would have to account for all the aforementioned\nrobot-object, object-object interactions. The complexity of the process model\ngrows exponentially as the number of objects in the scene increases. This is\ncommonly the case in unstructured environments. Hence it is not reasonable to\nattempt to model all object-object and robot-object interactions explicitly.\nUnder this setting we propose a hypothesis based action selection algorithm\nwhere we construct a hypothesis set of the possible poses of an object of\ninterest given the current evidence in the scene and select actions based on\nour current set of hypothesis. This hypothesis set tends to represent the\nbelief about the structure of the environment and the number of poses the\nobject of interest can take. The agent's only stopping criterion is when the\nuncertainty regarding the pose of the object is fully resolved."

    "summary": "Exploiting interaction with the environment is a promising and powerful way\nto enhance stability of humanoid robots and robustness while executing\nlocomotion and manipulation tasks. Recently some works have started to show\nadvances in this direction considering humanoid locomotion with multi-contacts,\nbut to be able to fully develop such abilities in a more autonomous way, we\nneed to first understand and classify the variety of possible poses a humanoid\nrobot can achieve to balance. To this end, we propose the adaptation of a\nsuccessful idea widely used in the field of robot grasping to the field of\nhumanoid balance with multi-contacts: a whole-body pose taxonomy classifying\nthe set of whole-body robot configurations that use the environment to enhance\nstability. We have revised criteria of classification used to develop grasping\ntaxonomies, focusing on structuring and simplifying the large number of\npossible poses the human body can adopt. We propose a taxonomy with 46 poses,\ncontaining three main categories, considering number and type of supports as\nwell as possible transitions between poses. The taxonomy induces a\nclassification of motion primitives based on the pose used for support, and a\nset of rules to store and generate new motions. We present preliminary results\nthat apply known segmentation techniques to motion data from the KIT whole-body\nmotion database. Using motion capture data with multi-contacts, we can identify\nsupport poses providing a segmentation that can distinguish between locomotion\nand manipulation parts of an action."

    "summary": "In shared autonomy, user input and robot autonomy are combined to control a\nrobot to achieve a goal. Often, the robot does not know a priori which goal the\nuser wants to achieve, and must both predict the user's intended goal, and\nassist in achieving that goal. We formulate the problem of shared autonomy as a\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process with uncertainty over the user's\ngoal. We utilize maximum entropy inverse optimal control to estimate a\ndistribution over the user's goal based on the history of inputs. Ideally, the\nrobot assists the user by solving for an action which minimizes the expected\ncost-to-go for the (unknown) goal. As solving the POMDP to select the optimal\naction is intractable, we use hindsight optimization to approximate the\nsolution. In a user study, we compare our method to a standard\npredict-then-blend approach. We find that our method enables users to\naccomplish tasks more quickly while utilizing less input. However, when asked\nto rate each system, users were mixed in their assessment, citing a tradeoff\nbetween maintaining control authority and accomplishing tasks quickly."

    "summary": "This article presents computationally efficient algorithms for modeling two\nspecial cases of rigid contact---contact with only viscous friction and contact\nwithout slip---that have particularly useful applications in robotic locomotion\nand grasping. Modeling rigid contact with Coulomb friction generally exhibits\n$O(n^3)$ expected time complexity in the number of contact points and\n$2^{O(n)}$ worst-case complexity. The special cases we consider exhibit $O(m^3\n+ m^2n)$ time complexity ($m$ is the number of independent coordinates in the\nmulti rigid body system) in the expected case and polynomial complexity in the\nworst case; thus, asymptotic complexity is no longer driven by number of\ncontact points (which is conceivably limitless) but instead is more dependent\non the number of bodies in the system (which is often fixed). These special\ncases also require considerably fewer constrained nonlinear optimization\nvariables thus yielding substantial improvements in running time. Finally,\nthese special cases also afford one other advantage: the nonlinear optimization\nproblems are numerically easier to solve."

    "summary": "Recent work on simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping (STEAM) for\nmobile robots has found success by representing the trajectory as a Gaussian\nprocess. Gaussian processes can represent a continuous-time trajectory,\nelegantly handle asynchronous and sparse measurements, and allow the robot to\nquery the trajectory to recover its estimated position at any time of interest.\nA major drawback of this approach is that STEAM is formulated as a batch\nestimation problem. In this paper we provide the critical extensions necessary\nto transform the existing batch algorithm into an extremely efficient\nincremental algorithm. In particular, we are able to vastly speed up the\nsolution time through efficient variable reordering and incremental sparse\nupdates, which we believe will greatly increase the practicality of Gaussian\nprocess methods for robot mapping and localization.

    "summary": "Haptic shared control is expected to achieve a smooth collaboration between\nhumans and automated systems, because haptics facilitate mutual communication.\nA methodology for sharing a given task is important to achieve effective shared\ncontrol. Therefore, the appropriate cooperative relationship between a human\noperator and automated system should be considered. This paper proposes a\nmethodology to evaluate the cooperative status between the operator and the\nautomated system in the haptic shared control of a steering operation using a\npseudo-power pair of torque from each agent and the vehicle lateral velocity as\neach agent's contribution to vehicle motion. This method allows us to estimate\ncooperative status based on two axes: the initiative holder and the intent\nconsistency between the two agents. A control method for a lane-keeping assist\nsystem (LKAS) that enables drivers to change lanes smoothly is proposed based\non the estimated cooperative status. A gain-tuning control method based on the\nestimated cooperative status is proposed to decrease the assistance system's\npseudo-power when intent inconsistency occurs. A method for switching the\nfollowed lane to match the driver's and assistance system's intentions is also\nproposed. A user study using a driving simulator is conducted to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed methods facilitate smooth driver-initiated lane changes without\nsignificantly affecting the driver's torque or steering wheel angle while\nsignificantly improve lane-keeping performance."

In the literature, there exists an extremum seeking-based\nstrategy under a constant forward velocity and tunable pitch and yaw\nvelocities. Obviously, the vehicle with a constant forward velocity may exhibit\ncertain overshoots in the seeking process and can not slow down even it\napproaches the source. To resolve this undesired behavior, this paper proposes\na regulation strategy for the forward velocity along with the pitch and yaw\nvelocities. Under such a strategy, the vehicle slows down near the source and\nstays within a small area as if it comes to a full stop, and controllers for\nangular velocities become succinct. We prove the local exponential convergence\nvia the averaging technique. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated\nwith simulations."

This allows to eliminate the need to perform\ncostly self-collision checks online when solving motion-planning problems,\nassuming some offline preprocessing. In particular, given a specific robot type\nour algorithm precomputes a tiling roadmap, which efficiently and implicitly\nencodes the self-collision free (sub-)space over the entire configuration\nspace, where the latter can be infinite for that matter. To answer any query,\nin any given scenario, we traverse the tiling roadmap while only testing for\ncollisions with obstacles. Our algorithm suggests more flexibility than the\nprevailing paradigm in which a precomputed roadmap depends both on the robot\nand on the scenario at hand. We show through various simulations the\neffectiveness of this approach on open and closed-chain multi-link robots,\nwhere in some settings our algorithm is more than fifty times faster than the\nstate-of-the-art."

    "summary": "This article presents a novel approach, named MCMP (Monte Carlo Motion\nPlanning), to the problem of motion planning under uncertainty, i.e., to the\nproblem of computing a low-cost path that fulfills probabilistic collision\navoidance constraints. MCMP estimates the collision probability (CP) of a given\npath by sampling via Monte Carlo the execution of a reference tracking\ncontroller (in this paper we consider LQG). The key algorithmic contribution of\nthis paper is the design of statistical variance-reduction techniques, namely\ncontrol variates and importance sampling, to make such a sampling procedure\namenable to real-time implementation. MCMP applies this CP estimation procedure\nto motion planning by iteratively (i) computing an (approximately) optimal path\nfor the deterministic version of the problem (here, using the FMT* algorithm),\n(ii) computing the CP of this path, and (iii) inflating or deflating the\nobstacles by a common factor depending on whether the CP is higher or lower\nthan a target value. The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic\ncorrectness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which,\nas shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the\ncomputation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii)\ngenerality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem\nprovided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles\nin the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the\ncorrectness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and\ncomputational speed of MCMP."

Such algorithms\nare probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and\nidentically distributed random points in the configuration space. Their\nrandomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including\ncertification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation\nto improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether\nsimilar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be\nobtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences.\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question.\nSpecifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning\nparameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is\ndeterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the\nconvergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very\nexplicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence\nand the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal\nversion of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close\nto O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the\nsequence. This is in stark contrast to the O(n logn) complexity results for\nexisting asymptotically-optimal probabilistic planners. Finally, through\nnumerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic low-dispersion\nsampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and\nsuccess rate."

    "summary": "Parametric filters, such as the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented\nKalman Filter, typically scale well with the dimensionality of the problem, but\nthey are known to fail if the posterior state distribution cannot be closely\napproximated by a density of the assumed parametric form. For nonparametric\nfilters, such as the Particle Filter, the converse holds. Such methods are able\nto approximate any posterior, but the computational requirements scale\nexponentially with the number of dimensions of the state space. In this paper,\nwe present the Coordinate Particle Filter which alleviates this problem. We\npropose to compute the particle weights recursively, dimension by dimension.\nThis allows us to explore one dimension at a time, and resample after each\ndimension if necessary. Experimental results on simulated as well as real data\nconfirm that the proposed method has a substantial performance advantage over\nthe Particle Filter in high-dimensional systems where not all dimensions are\nhighly correlated. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method for the\nproblem of multi-object and robotic manipulator tracking."

The extent of focus of this paper is on the perception\n(robotic sense of analyzing surroundings) in space robots in the exploration of\nextra-terrestrial planets. Robots play a crucial role in exploring\nextra-terrestrial and planetary bodies. Their advantages are far from being\ncounted on finger tips. With the advent of autonomous robots in the field of\nrobotics, the role for space exploration has further hustled up. Optimization\nof such autonomous robots has turned into a necessity of the hour. Optimized\nrobots tend to have a superior role in space exploration. With so many\nconsiderations to monitor, an optimized solution will nevertheless help a\nplanetary rover perform better under tight circumstances. Keeping in view the\nabove mentioned area, the paper describes recent developments in the\noptimization of autonomous extra-terrestrial rovers."

    "summary": "Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is the problem of estimating a set of poses\nfrom pairwise relative measurements. PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently\nno known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In\nthis paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal\nsolution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases.\nOur first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This\nmakes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature\non unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results\nabout the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second\ncontribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex\ndomain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of\neigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution\nof the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then\n(i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution,\nand (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the\npenalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit\nthe dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal\nsolution for PGO when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero\nEigenvalue Property (SZEP). We also propose a variant that deals with the case\nin which the SZEP is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical\nanalysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100% of\nthe tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized\npose graph matrix does satisfy the SZEP, hence our approach allows computing\nthe global optimal solution. Finally, we report simple counterexamples in which\nthe duality gap is nonzero, and discuss open problems."

    "summary": "The emergent global behaviours of robotic swarms are important to achieve\ntheir navigation task goals. These emergent behaviours can be verified to\nassess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model\nchecking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete\nmodel of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model\nchecking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model\nare numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the\nform of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,\nbased on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids. We applied the relative\nencoding to a swarm navigation algorithm, Alpha, modelled for the NuSMV model\nchecker. A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an\nabsolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights\nthe advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and\nnumber of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.\nFor example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum\nallowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased\nto 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a\nswarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7\nminutes. Our approach is transferable to other swarm navigation algorithms."

Indeed, the control loop of a\nparallel kinematic machine should be computed with a high frequency, i.e.,\nhigher than 1.5 MHz, in order the manipulator to be able to reach high speed\nmotions with a good accuracy. Accordingly, the direct and inverse kinematic\nmodels of the Orthoglide 5-axis, its inverse kine-matic Jacobian matrix and the\nfirst derivative of the latter with respect to time are expressed in this\npaper.

It enables floating-base\nhighly-redundant robots to achieve unified motion/force control of one or more\noperational space objectives while adhering to physical constraints. Limited\nstudies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to\nperform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper we address this\nby presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.\nUnlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase servo\nfrequencies on standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables\ntight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible\nset of transport protocols. To support a new robot, only two plugins and a URDF\nmodel needs to be provided --- the rest of ControlIt! remains unchanged. New\nWBC primitives can be added by writing a Task or Constraint plugin.\nControlIt!'s capabilities are demonstrated on Dreamer, a 16-DOF torque\ncontrolled humanoid upper body robot containing both series elastic and\nco-actuated joints, and using it to perform a product disassembly task. Using\nthis testbed, we show that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of\nabout 0.5ms when configured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation\ntasks, and a lower priority posture task. This is significantly higher than the\n5ms that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC that\nis both application and platform-specific. Variations in the product's position\nis handled by updating the goal of the Cartesian position task. ControlIt!'s\nsource code is released under an LGPL license and we hope it will be adopted\nand maintained by the WBC community for the long term as a platform for WBC\ndevelopment and integration."

    "summary": "The visual cue of optical flow plays a major role in the navigation of flying\ninsects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A\nmajor problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance\nestimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to\ndistance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to\nestimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control\ninputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control\ngain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the\ndistance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first\nstarts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.\nThe proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major\nattractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the\nrobot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be\nestimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The\nstability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with\na Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final\napproach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)\nestimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire\nlanding if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the\n'edge of oscillation'."

    "summary": "Planning under uncertainty is a key requirement for physical systems due to\nthe noisy nature of actuators and sensors. Using a belief space approach,\nplanning solutions tend to generate actions that result in information seeking\nbehavior which reduce state uncertainty. While recent work has dealt with\nplanning for Gaussian beliefs, for many cases, a multi-modal belief is a more\naccurate representation of the underlying belief. This is particularly true in\nenvironments with information symmetry that cause uncertain data associations\nwhich naturally lead to a multi-modal hypothesis on the state. Thus, a planner\ncannot simply base actions on the most-likely state. We propose an algorithm\nthat uses a Receding Horizon Planning approach to plan actions that\nsequentially disambiguate the multi-modal belief to a uni-modal Gaussian and\nachieve tight localization on the true state, called a Multi-Modal Motion\nPlanner (M3P). By combining a Gaussian sampling-based belief space planner with\nM3P, and introducing a switching behavior in the planner and belief\nrepresentation, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for the belief space\nplanning problem.

    "summary": "Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has a long history in describing\nrunning behavior in animals and humans as well as has been used as a design\nbasis for robots capable of dynamic locomotion. Anchoring the SLIP for lossy\nphysical systems resulted in newer models which are extended versions of\noriginal SLIP with viscous damping in the leg. However, such lossy models\nrequire an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the\nlocomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by\nadding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this\nactuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the\npopular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM\ndominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control\nchallenging especially at slow speeds. The situation becomes more severe when\nthe horizontal speed of the robot reaches zero, i.e. steady hoping without\nmoving in horizontal direction, and the system reaches to singularity in which\nvertical degrees of freedom is completely lost. To this end, we propose an\nextension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,\nthat can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical\ndirection. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear\nsystem dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the\nlocomotion.

    "summary": "In our prior work, we outlined an approach, named DisCoF, for cooperative\npathfinding in distributed systems with limited sensing and communication\nrange. Contrasting to prior works on cooperative pathfinding with completeness\nguarantees, which often assume the access to global information, DisCoF does\nnot make this assumption. The implication is that at any given time in DisCoF,\nthe robots may not all be aware of each other, which is often the case in\ndistributed systems. As a result, DisCoF represents an inherently online\napproach since coordination can only be realized in an opportunistic manner\nbetween robots that are within each other's sensing and communication range.\nHowever, there are a few assumptions made in DisCoF to facilitate a formal\nanalysis, which must be removed to work with distributed multi-robot platforms.\nIn this paper, we present DisCoF$^+$, which extends DisCoF by enabling an\nasynchronous solution, as well as providing flexible decoupling between robots\nfor performance improvement. We also extend the formal results of DisCoF to\nDisCoF$^+$. Furthermore, we evaluate our implementation of DisCoF$^+$ and\ndemonstrate a simulation of it running in a distributed multi-robot\nenvironment. Finally, we compare DisCoF$^+$ with DisCoF in terms of plan\nquality and planning performance."

    "summary": "We explore the probabilistic foundations of shared control in complex dynamic\nenvironments. In order to do this, we formulate shared control as a random\nprocess and describe the joint distribution that governs its behavior. For\ntractability, we model the relationships between the operator, autonomy, and\ncrowd as an undirected graphical model. Further, we introduce an interaction\nfunction between the operator and the robot, that we call \"agreeability\"; in\ncombination with the methods developed in~\\cite{trautman-ijrr-2015}, we extend\na cooperative collision avoidance autonomy to shared control. We therefore\nquantify the notion of simultaneously optimizing over agreeability (between the\noperator and autonomy), and safety and efficiency in crowded environments. We\nshow that for a particular form of interaction function between the autonomy\nand the operator, linear blending is recovered exactly. Additionally, to\nrecover linear blending, unimodal restrictions must be placed on the models\ndescribing the operator and the autonomy. In turn, these restrictions raise\nquestions about the flexibility and applicability of the linear blending\nframework. Additionally, we present an extension of linear blending called\n\"operator biased linear trajectory blending\" (which formalizes some recent\napproaches in linear blending such as~\\cite{dragan-ijrr-2013}) and show that\nnot only is this also a restrictive special case of our probabilistic approach,\nbut more importantly, is statistically unsound, and thus, mathematically,\nunsuitable for implementation. Instead, we suggest a statistically principled\napproach that guarantees data is used in a consistent manner, and show how this\nalternative approach converges to the full probabilistic framework. We conclude\nby proving that, in general, linear blending is suboptimal with respect to the\njoint metric of agreeability, safety, and efficiency."

In the\npresence of packet loss the coordination information among agents is lost.\nMoreover, there is a move to use wireless channels in formation control\napplications. It has been found in practice that packet losses are more\npronounced in wireless channels, than their wired counterparts. In our\nanalysis, we first show that packet loss may result in loss of rigidity. In\nturn this causes the entire formation to fail. Later, we present an estimation\nbased formation control algorithm that is robust to packet loss among agents.\nThe proposed estimation algorithm employs minimal spanning tree algorithm to\ncompute the estimate of the node variables (coordination variables).\nConsequently, this reduces the communication overhead required for information\nexchange.

Traditionally an unsupervised\nlearning method, hierarchical clustering offers a formalism for identifying and\nrepresenting spatially cohesive and segregated robot groups at different\nresolutions by relating the continuous space of configurations to the\ncombinatorial space of trees. We formalize and exploit this relation,\ndeveloping computationally effective reactive algorithms for navigating through\nthe combinatorial space in concert with geometric realizations for a particular\nchoice of hierarchical clustering method. These constructions yield\ncomputationally effective vector field planners for both hierarchically\ninvariant as well as transitional navigation in the configuration space. We\napply these methods to the centralized coordination and control of $n$\nperfectly sensed and actuated Euclidean spheres in a $d$-dimensional ambient\nspace (for arbitrary $n$ and $d$). Given a desired configuration supporting a\ndesired hierarchy, we construct a hybrid controller which is quadratic in $n$\nand algebraic in $d$ and prove that its execution brings all but a measure zero\nset of initial configurations to the desired goal with the guarantee of no\ncollisions along the way."

A MicroStressBot is an electrostatic microrobot that\nconsists of an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA) that provides forward\nmotion, and a steering-arm actuator that determines whether the robot moves in\nstraight line or turns. The steering-arm is actuated through electrostatic\npull-down to the substrate initiated by the applied global power delivery and\ncontrol signal. Control of multiple MicroStressBots is achieved by varying the\ngeometry of the steering-arm, and hence affecting its electrostatic pull-down\nand/or release voltages. Independent control of many MicroStressBots is\nachieved by fabricating the arms of the individual microrobots in such a way\nthat the robots move differently from one another during portions of the global\ncontrol signal. In this paper we analyze the scalability of control in an\nobstacle free configuration space. Based on robust control strategies, we\nderive the control signals that command some of the robots to make progress\ntoward the goal, while the others stay in small orbits, for several classes of\nsteering-arm geometries. We also present a comprehensive analysis and\ncomparison between the numbers of required independent pull-down and release\nvoltages, demonstrating significant improvement in terms of the efficiency as\nwell as the size of the control signal presented in past work.

    "summary": "When executing whole-body motions, humans are able to use a large variety of\nsupport poses which not only utilize the feet, but also hands, knees and elbows\nto enhance stability. While there are many works analyzing the transitions\ninvolved in walking, very few works analyze human motion where more complex\nsupports occur.\n  In this work, we analyze complex support pose transitions in human motion\ninvolving locomotion and manipulation tasks (loco-manipulation). We have\napplied a method for the detection of human support contacts from motion\ncapture data to a large-scale dataset of loco-manipulation motions involving\nmulti-contact supports, providing a semantic representation of them. Our\nresults provide a statistical analysis of the used support poses, their\ntransitions and the time spent in each of them. In addition, our data partially\nvalidates our taxonomy of whole-body support poses presented in our previous\nwork.\n  We believe that this work extends our understanding of human motion for\nhumanoids, with a long-term objective of developing methods for autonomous\nmulti-contact motion planning."

The work presented here explains the walking pattern,\nsystem control and actuator control techniques for 10 Degree of Freedom (DOF)\nbiped humanoid. Bi-pedal robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled\nrobots, but they tend to topple easily. In order to walk stably in various\nenvironments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions\ncontaining obstacles, it is necessary, that robot should adapt to the ground\nconditions with a foot motion, as well as maintain its stability with a torso\nmotion. It is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque\nand velocity of the joint actuators. The work proposed a low cost solution\nusing open source hardware-software and application.

    "summary": "In manipulation tasks, a robot interacts with movable object(s). The\nconfiguration space in manipulation planning is thus the Cartesian product of\nthe configuration space of the robot with those of the movable objects. It is\nthe complex structure of such a \"Composite Configuration Space\" that makes\nmanipulation planning particularly challenging. Previous works approximate the\nconnectivity of the Composite Configuration Space by means of discretization or\nby creating random roadmaps. Such approaches involve an extensive\npre-processing phase, which furthermore has to be re-done each time the\nenvironment changes. In this paper, we propose a high-level Grasp-Placement\nTable similar to that proposed by Tournassoud et al. (1987), but which does not\nrequire any discretization or heavy pre-processing. The table captures the\npotential connectivity of the Composite Configuration Space while being\nspecific only to the movable object: in particular, it does not require to be\nre-computed when the environment changes. During the query phase, the table is\nused to guide a tree-based planner that explores the space systematically. Our\nsimulations and experiments show that the proposed method enables improvements\nin both running time and trajectory quality as compared to existing approaches."

    "summary": "In this paper we consider the problem of coordinating robotic systems with\ndifferent kinematics, sensing and vision capabilities to achieve certain\nmission goals. An approach that makes use of a heterogeneous team of agents has\nseveral advantages when cost, integration of capabilities, or large search\nareas need to be considered. A heterogeneous team allows for the robots to\nbecome \"specialized\", accomplish sub-goals more effectively, and thus increase\nthe overall mission efficiency. Two main scenarios are considered in this work.\nIn the first case study we exploit mobility to implement a power control\nalgorithm that increases the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)\namong certain members of the network. We create realistic sensing fields and\nmanipulation by using the geometric properties of the sensor field-of-view and\nthe manipulability metric, respectively. The control strategy for each agent of\nthe heterogeneous system is governed by an artificial physics law that\nconsiders the different kinematics of the agents and the environment, in a\ndecentralized fashion. Through simulation results we show that the network is\nable to stay connected at all times and covers the environment well. The second\nscenario studied in this paper is the biologically-inspired coordination of\nheterogeneous physical robotic systems. A team of ground rovers, designed to\nemulate desert seed-harvester ants, explore an experimental area using\nbehaviors fine-tuned in simulation by a genetic algorithm. Our robots\ncoordinate with a base station and collect clusters of resources scattered\nwithin the experimental space. We demonstrate experimentally that through\ncoordination with an aerial vehicle, our ant-like ground robots are able to\ncollect resources two times faster than without the use of heterogeneous\ncoordination."

    "summary": "One of the most fundamental problems when designing controllers for dynamic\nsystems is the tuning of the controller parameters. Typically, a model of the\nsystem is used to obtain an initial controller, but ultimately the controller\nparameters must be tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best\nperformance. To avoid this manual tuning step, methods from machine learning,\nsuch as Bayesian optimization, have been used. However, as these methods\nevaluate different controller parameters on the real system, safety-critical\nsystem failures may happen. In this paper, we overcome this problem by\napplying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,\nSafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an\ninitial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the\nparameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying\nperformance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller\nparameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high\nprobability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the\nproposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller\nparameters without human intervention."

    "summary": "Monocular motion cues have been widely used by Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) to\ndetect obstacles during visual navigation. However, this approach requires\nsignificant movement, which reduces the efficiency of navigation and may even\nintroduce risks in narrow spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup of\nself-supervised learning (SSL), in which motion cues serve as a scaffold to\nlearn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment. We apply it to a\nlanding task, in which initially 'surface roughness' is estimated from the\noptical flow field in order to detect obstacles. Subsequently, a regression\nfunction is learned that maps appearance features represented by texton\ndistributions to a surface roughness estimate. After learning, the MAV can\ndetect obstacles by just analyzing a still image. This allows the MAV to search\nfor a landing spot without moving. We first demonstrate this principle to work\nwith offline tests involving images captured from an on-board camera, and then\ndemonstrate the principle in flight. Although surface roughness is a property\nof the entire flow field in the global image, the appearance learning even\nallows for the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles."

    "summary": "Magnetometer has received wide applications in attitude determination and\nscientific measurements. Calibration is an important step for any practical\nmagnetometer use. The most popular three-axis magnetometer calibration methods\nare attitude-independent and have been founded on an approximate maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimation with a quartic subjective function, derived from the\nfact that the magnitude of the calibrated measurements should be constant in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field. This paper highlights the shortcomings of those\npopular methods and proposes to use the quadratic optimal ML estimation instead\nfor magnetometer calibration. Simulation and test results show that the optimal\nML calibration is superior to the approximate ML methods for magnetometer\ncalibration in both accuracy and stability, especially for those situations\nwithout sufficient attitude excitation. The significant benefits deserve the\nmoderately increased computation burden. The main conclusion obtained in the\ncontext of magnetometer in this paper is potentially applicable to various\nkinds of three-axis sensors."

In the case of terrestrial robots, one of\nthe available options is the GNBot, an open-hardware project intended for the\nevaluation of swarm search strategies. The lack of basic odometry sensors such\nas wheel encoders had so far difficulted the implementation of an accurate\nhigh-level controller in this platform. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to\nimprove motion control in the GNBot by incorporating a gyroscope whilst\nmaintaining the requisite of no wheel encoders. Among the problems that have\nbeen tackled are: accurate in-place rotations, minimal drift during linear\nmotions, and arc-performing functionality. Additionally, the resulting\ncontroller is calibrated autonomously by using both the gyroscope module and\nthe infrared rangefinder on board each robot, greatly simplifying the\ncalibration of large swarms. The report first explains the design decisions\nthat were made in order to implement the self-calibration routine, and then\nevaluates the performance of the new motion controller by means of off-line\nvideo tracking.

After analyzing the simulation\nresults, we find dual-arm regrasp is not necessarily better than single-arm\nregrasp: Dual-arm regrasp is flexible. When the two hands can grasp the object\nwith good clearance, dual-arm regrasp is better and has higher successful rate\nthan single-arm regrasp. However, dual-arm regrasp suffers from geometric\nconstraints caused by the two arms. When the grasps overlap, dual-arm regrasp\nis bad. Developers need to sample grasps with high density to reduce\noverlapping. This leads to exploded combinatorics in previous methods, but is\npossible with the algorithms presented in this paper.

    "summary": "Inverse dynamics is used extensively in robotics and biomechanics\napplications. In manipulator and legged robots, it can form the basis of an\neffective nonlinear control strategy by providing a robot with both accurate\npositional tracking and active compliance. In biomechanics applications,\ninverse dynamics control can approximately determine the net torques applied at\nanatomical joints that correspond to an observed motion.\n  In the context of robot control, using inverse dynamics requires knowledge of\nall contact forces acting on the robot; accurately perceiving external forces\napplied to the robot requires filtering and thus significant time delay. An\nalternative approach has been suggested in recent literature: predicting\ncontact and actuator forces simultaneously under the assumptions of rigid body\ndynamics, rigid contact, and friction. Existing such inverse dynamics\napproaches have used approximations to the contact models, which permits use of\nfast numerical linear algebra algorithms. In contrast, we describe inverse\ndynamics algorithms that are derived only from first principles and use\nestablished phenomenological models like Coulomb friction.\n  We assess these inverse dynamics algorithms in a control context using two\nvirtual robots: a locomoting quadrupedal robot and a fixed-based manipulator\ngripping a box while using perfectly accurate sensor data from simulation. The\ndata collected from these experiments gives an upper bound on the performance\nof such controllers in situ. For points of comparison, we assess performance on\nthe same tasks with both error feedback control and inverse dynamics control\nwith virtual contact force sensing."

    "summary": "Fine robotic assembly, in which the parts to be assembled are small and\nfragile and lie in an unstructured environment, is still out of reach of\ntoday's industrial robots. The main difficulties arise in the precise\nlocalization of the parts in an unstructured environment and the control of\ncontact interactions. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we\npropose a taxonomy of the manipulation primitives that are specifically\ninvolved in fine assembly. Such a taxonomy is crucial for designing a scalable\nrobotic system (both hardware and software) given the complexity of real-world\nassembly tasks. Second, we present a hardware and software architecture where\nwe have addressed, in an integrated way, a number of issues arising in fine\nassembly, such as workspace optimization, external wrench compensation,\nposition-based force control, etc. Finally, we show the above taxonomy and\narchitecture in action on a highly dexterous task -- bimanual pin insertion --\nwhich is one of the key steps in our long term project, the autonomous assembly\nof an IKEA chair."

    "summary": "One of the goals of computer-aided surgery is to match intraoperative data to\npreoperative images of the anatomy and add complementary information that can\nfacilitate the task of surgical navigation. In this context, mechanical\npalpation can reveal critical anatomical features such as arteries and\ncancerous lumps which are stiffer that the surrounding tissue. This work uses\nposition and force measurements obtained during mechanical palpation for\nregistration and stiffness mapping. Prior approaches, including our own,\nexhaustively palpated the entire organ to achieve this goal. To overcome the\ncostly palpation of the entire organ, a Bayesian optimization framework is\nintroduced to guide the end effector to palpate stiff regions while\nsimultaneously updating the registration of the end effector to an a priori\ngeometric model of the organ, hence enabling the fusion of ntraoperative data\ninto the a priori model obtained through imaging. This new framework uses\nGaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and Bayesian\noptimization to direct where to sample next for maximum information gain. The\nproposed method was evaluated with experimental data obtained using a Cartesian\nrobot interacting with a silicone organ model and an ex vivo porcine liver."

    "summary": "The deformable and continuum nature of soft robots promises versatility and\nadaptability. However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for\nterrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure,\nactuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot\ncontrol is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and\nfinite element analysis. The research presents an alternative, model-free,\ndata-driven, reinforcement learning inspired approach, for controlling\nmulti-limbed soft material robots. This control approach can be summarized as a\nfour-step process of discretization, visualization, learning and optimization.\nThe first step involves identification and subsequent discretization of key\nfactors that dominate robot-environment, in turn, the robot control. Graph\ntheory is used to visualize relationships and transitions between the\ndiscretized states. The graph representation facilitates mathematical\ndefinition of periodic control patterns (simple cycles) and locomotion gaits.\nRewards corresponding to individual arcs of the graph are weighted displacement\nand orientation change for robot state-to-state transitions. These rewards are\nspecific to surface of locomotion and are learned. Finally, the control\npatterns result from optimization of reward dependent locomotion task (e.g.\ntranslation) cost function. The optimization problem is an Integer Linear\nProgramming problem which can be quickly solved using standard solvers. The\nframework is generic and independent of type of actuator, soft material\nproperties or the type of friction mechanism, as the control exists in the\nrobot's task space. Furthermore, the data-driven nature of the framework\nimparts adaptability to the framework toward different locomotion surfaces by\nre-learning rewards."

    "summary": "Robots built from soft materials can alter their shape and size in a\nparticular profile. This shape-changing ability could be extremely helpful for\nrescue robots and those operating in unknown terrains and environments. In\nchanging shape, soft materials also store and release elastic energy, a feature\nthat can be exploited for effective robot movement. However, design and control\nof these moving soft robots are non-trivial. The research presents design\nmethodology for a 3D-printed, motor-tendon actuated soft robot capable of\nlocomotion. In addition to shape change, the robot uses friction manipulation\nmechanisms to effect locomotion. The motor-tendon actuators comprise of nylon\ntendons embedded inside the soft body structure along a given path with one end\nfixed on the body and the other attached to a motor. These actuators directly\ncontrol the deformation of the soft body which influences the robot locomotion\nbehavior. Static stress analysis is used as a tool for designing the shape of\nthe paths of these tendons embedded inside the body. The research also presents\na novel model-free learning-based control approach for soft robots which\ninteract with the environment at discrete contact points. This approach\ninvolves discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions as\nstates, learning of the results as robot transitions between these robot states\nand evaluation of desired periodic state control sequences optimizing a cost\nfunction corresponding to a locomotion task (rotation or translation). The\nclever discretization allows the framework to exist in robot's task space,\nhence, facilitating calculation of control sequences without modeling the\nactuator, body material or details of the friction mechanisms. The flexibility\nof the framework is experimentally explored by applying it to robots with\ndifferent friction mechanisms and different shapes of tendon paths."

    "summary": "Soft materials have many important roles in animal locomotion and object\nmanipulation. In robotic applications soft materials can store and release\nenergy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible\nshape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a\npotential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the\nenvironment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material\nactuation and the need to exploit frictional interactions to generate\nlocomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of\ncontinuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions\nthat result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a\nsoft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The\nbioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which\ninteracts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar\nprolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy\ncoils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner.\nThis novel virtual grip mechanism combines two materials with different\ncoefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment\nfriction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept\nthat discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states.\nThis facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the\nspecific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to\nmulti-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are\nassigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be\ncalculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it\ncan be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function."

The TFG uses\ngraphical models, which utilize independences between variables, and enables a\nunified quantification of exploration and exploitation gains with a single\nentropy metric.

The proposed behaviour controller\nprovides an informed intelligent search based on a semantic segmentation\nframework for indoor scenes and integrates it with object recognition and\ngrasping. Instead of manually annotating search positions in the environment,\nthe framework automatically suggests likely locations to search for an object\nbased on contextual information, e.g. next to tables and shelves.

    "summary": "In this paper we present a new approach for dynamic motion planning for\nlegged robots. We formulate a trajectory optimization problem based on a\ncompact form of the robot dynamics. Such a form is obtained by projecting the\nrigid body dynamics onto the null space of the Constraint Jacobian. As\nconsequence of the projection, contact forces are removed from the model but\ntheir effects are still taken into account. This approach permits to solve the\noptimal control problem of a floating base constrained multibody system while\navoiding the use of an explicit contact model. We use direct transcription to\nnumerically solve the optimization. As the contact forces are not part of the\ndecision variables the size of the resultant discrete mathematical program is\nreduced and therefore solutions can be obtained in a tractable time. Using a\npredefined sequence of contact configurations (phases), our approach solves\nmotions where contact switches occur. Transitions between phases are\nautomatically resolved without using a model for switching dynamics. We present\nresults on a hydraulic quadruped robot (HyQ), including single phase (standing,\ncrouching) as well as multiple phase (rearing, diagonal leg balancing and\nstepping) dynamic motions."

    "summary": "Recent years have witnessed the prosperity of robots and in order to support\nconsensus and cooperation for multi-robot system, wireless communications and\nnetworking among robots and the infrastructure have become indispensable. In\nthis technical note, we first provide an overview of the research contributions\non communication-aware motion planning (CAMP) in designing wireless-connected\nrobotic networks (WCRNs), where the degree-of-freedom (DoF) provided by motion\nand communication capabilities embraced by the robots have not been fully\nexploited. Therefore, we propose the framework of joint communication-motion\nplanning (JCMP) as well as the architecture for incorporating JCMP in WCRNs.\nThe proposed architecture is motivated by the observe-orient-decision-action\n(OODA) model commonly adopted in robotic motion control and cognitive radio.\nThen, we provide an overview of the orient module that quantify the\nconnectivity assessment. Afterwards, we highlight the JCMP module and compare\nit with the conventional communication-planning, where the necessity of the\nJCMP is validated via both theoretical analysis and simulation results of an\nillustrative example. Finally, a series of open problems are discussed, which\npicture the gap between the state-of-the-art and a practical WCRN."

Data-driven approaches to this tactile perception\nproblem show promise, but there is a dearth of suitable training data.

    "summary": "Swarm robotics is a promising approach for the coordination of large numbers\nof robots. While previous studies have shown that evolutionary robotics\ntechniques can be applied to obtain robust and efficient self-organized\nbehaviors for robot swarms, most studies have been conducted in simulation, and\nthe few that have been conducted on real robots have been confined to\nlaboratory environments. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a\nswarm robotics system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and\nuncontrolled environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in\nsimulation for canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion,\nclustering, and monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers\non a real swarm of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the\nevolved controllers transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a\nperformance similar to the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that\nthe evolved controllers display key properties of swarm intelligence-based\ncontrol, namely scalability, flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We\nconclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in which the swarm performs a\ncomplete environmental monitoring task by combining multiple evolved\ncontrollers."

As compared with\nprior random sampling algorithms for contact space approximation, our\npropagation sampling considerably speeds up the precomputation and yields a\nhigh quality approximation. At run-time, we perform a nearest-neighbor query\nand local projection to efficiently compute the translational or generalized\nPD.

    "summary": "The Kilobot is a widely used platform for investigation of swarm robotics.\nPhysical Kilobots are slow moving and require frequent recalibration and\ncharging, which significantly slows down the development cycle. Simulators can\nspeed up the process of testing, exploring and hypothesis generation, but\nusually require time consuming and error-prone translation of code between\nsimulator and robot. Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct\ncomparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between\nsimulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have\ndeveloped a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use\nthe same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of\nour simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up\ndevelopment, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100\ntimes faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput\npre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired\nemergent behaviour. We argue that this strategy, here specifically developed\nfor Kilobots, is of general importance for effective robot swarm research. The\nsource code is freely available under the MIT license."

    "summary": "Planning under process and measurement uncertainties is a challenging\nproblem. In its most general form it can be modeled as a Partially Observed\nMarkov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. However POMDPs are generally difficult\nto solve when the underlying spaces are continuous, particularly when beliefs\nare non-Gaussian, and the difficulty is further exacerbated when there are also\nnon-convex constraints on states. Existing algorithms to address such\nchallenging POMDPs are expensive in terms of computation and memory. In this\npaper, we provide a feedback policy in non-Gaussian belief space via solving a\nconvex program for common non-linear observation models. The solution involves\na Receding Horizon Control strategy using particle filters for the non-Gaussian\nbelief representation. We develop a way of capturing non-convex constraints in\nthe state space and adapt the optimization to incorporate such constraints, as\nwell. A key advantage of this method is that it does not introduce additional\nvariables in the optimization problem and is therefore more scalable than\nexisting constrained problems in belief space. We demonstrate the performance\nof the method on different scenarios."

In this paper, we\nfocus on an important class of kinodynamic planners, namely those that\ninterpolate trajectories in the state space. We provide a proof of\nprobabilistic completeness for these planners under assumptions that can be\nreadily verified from the system's equations of motion and the user-defined\ninterpolation function. Our proof relies crucially on a property of\ninterpolated trajectories, termed second-order continuity (SOC), which we show\nis tightly related to the ability of a planner to benefit from denser sampling.\nWe analyze the impact of this property in simulations on a low-torque pendulum.\nOur results show that a simple RRT using a second-order continuous\ninterpolation swiftly finds solution, while it is impossible for the same\nplanner using standard Bezier curves (which are not SOC) to find any solution."

We define the Inertial\nReorientation template, the simplest model of this behavior, and leverage its\nlinear dynamics to reveal the design constraints linking a task with the body\ndesigns capable of completing it. As practicable inertial appendage designs\nlead to morphology that is generally more complex, we advance a notion of\n\"anchoring\" whereby a judicious choice of physical design in concert with an\nappropriate control policy yields a system whose closed loop dynamics are\nsufficiently captured by the template as to permit all further design to take\nplace in its far simpler parameter space. This approach is effective and\naccurate over the diverse design spaces afforded by existing platforms,\nenabling performance comparison through the shared task space. We analyze\nexamples from the literature and find advantages to each body type, but\nconclude that tails provide the highest potential performance for reasonable\ndesigns.

    "summary": "Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain\nhighly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time\noptimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this\nproblem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at\nhigh rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the\noptimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial\nmeasurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion\nconstraints. Our first contribution is a \\emph{preintegration theory} that\nproperly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally\ndiscuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation\nnoise and derive the expression for the \\emph{maximum a posteriori} state\nestimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary\nJacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic\nform. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can\nbe seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying\nframework of factor graphs. This enables the application of\nincremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \\emph{structureless} model\nfor visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further\naccelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our\nmonocular \\VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm\nthat our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time,\noutperforming state-of-the-art approaches."

Previous work on pick-and-place regrasp only leveraged flat\nsurfaces for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the capability to\nreorient an object.\n  In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place\nregrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the\nintermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically\ncomputes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin,\nfinds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and\nsearches for the regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with\nand without using pins, we evaluate the success rate and the length of regrasp\nsequences while performing tasks on various models.

    "summary": "This paper solves the classical problem of simultaneous localization and\nmapping (SLAM) in a fashion which avoids linearized approximations altogether.\nBased on creating virtual synthetic measurements, the algorithm uses a linear\ntime- varying (LTV) Kalman observer, bypassing errors and approximations\nbrought by the linearization process in traditional extended Kalman filtering\n(EKF) SLAM. Convergence rates of the algorithm are established using\ncontraction analysis. Different combinations of sensor information can be\nexploited, such as bearing measurements, range measurements, optical flow, or\ntime-to-contact. As illustrated in simulations, the proposed algorithm can\nsolve SLAM problems in both 2D and 3D scenarios with guaranteed convergence\nrates in a full nonlinear context."

    "summary": "We present a general framework to autonomously achieve a task, where autonomy\nis acquired by learning sensorimotor patterns of a robot, while it is\ninteracting with its environment. To accomplish the task, using the learned\nsensorimotor contingencies, our approach predicts a sequence of actions that\nwill lead to the desirable observations. Gaussian processes (GP) with automatic\nrelevance determination is used to learn the sensorimotor mapping. In this way,\nrelevant sensory and motor components can be systematically found in\nhigh-dimensional sensory and motor spaces. We propose an incremental GP\nlearning strategy, which discerns between situations, when an update or an\nadaptation must be implemented. RRT* is exploited to enable long-term planning\nand generating a sequence of states that lead to a given goal; while a\ngradient-based search finds the optimum action to steer to a neighbouring state\nin a single time step. Our experimental results prove the successfulness of the\nproposed framework to learn a joint space controller with high data dimensions\n(10$\\times$15). It demonstrates short training phase (less than 12 seconds),\nreal-time performance and rapid adaptations capabilities."

    "summary": "The Sixth International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for\nRobotic Systems (DSLRob'15) was held September 28, 2015 in Hamburg (Germany),\nas part of the IROS 2015 conference. The main topics of the workshop were\nDomain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and Model-driven Software Development (MDSD)\nfor robotics. A domain-specific language is a programming language dedicated to\na particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions\nthat increase programmer productivity within that domain. Model-driven software\ndevelopment offers a high-level way for domain users to specify the\nfunctionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and\nmodels have historically been used for programming complex systems. However\nrecently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic\nsystems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises\nmany crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...),\nfor which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor\nfit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and\nmodels offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the\nprogrammer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to\ncomplex problems within the robotics domain."

We present a framework, using a novel combination of well\nproven methods, allowing a quick automatic calibration for the integration of\nsystems consisting of the robot and a varying number of 3D cameras by using a\nstandard checkerboard calibration grid. Our approach allows a quick\ncamera-to-robot recalibration after any changes to the setup, for example when\ncameras or robot have been repositioned. Modular design of the system ensures\nflexibility regarding a number of sensors used as well as different hardware\nchoices. The framework has been proven to work by practical experiments to\nanalyze the quality of the calibration versus the number of positions of the\ncheckerboard used for each of the calibration procedures."

    "summary": "We introduce a functional gradient descent trajectory optimization algorithm\nfor robot motion planning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs).\nFunctional gradient algorithms are a popular choice for motion planning in\ncomplex many-degree-of-freedom robots, since they (in theory) work by directly\noptimizing within a space of continuous trajectories to avoid obstacles while\nmaintaining geometric properties such as smoothness. However, in practice,\nfunctional gradient algorithms typically commit to a fixed, finite\nparameterization of trajectories, often as a list of waypoints. Such a\nparameterization can lose much of the benefit of reasoning in a continuous\ntrajectory space: e.g., it can require taking an inconveniently small step size\nand large number of iterations to maintain smoothness. Our work generalizes\nfunctional gradient trajectory optimization by formulating it as minimization\nof a cost functional in an RKHS. This generalization lets us represent\ntrajectories as linear combinations of kernel functions, without any need for\nwaypoints. As a result, we are able to take larger steps and achieve a locally\noptimal trajectory in just a few iterations. Depending on the selection of\nkernel, we can directly optimize in spaces of trajectories that are inherently\nsmooth in velocity, jerk, curvature, etc., and that have a low-dimensional,\nadaptively chosen parameterization. Our experiments illustrate the\neffectiveness of the planner for different kernels, including Gaussian RBFs,\nLaplacian RBFs, and B-splines, as compared to the standard discretized waypoint\nrepresentation."

    "summary": "Motion planning under differential constraints, kinodynamic motion planning,\nis one of the canonical problems in robotics. Currently, state-of-the-art\nmethods evolve around kinodynamic variants of popular sampling-based\nalgorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). However, there are\nstill challenges remaining, for example, how to include complex dynamics while\nguaranteeing optimality. If the open-loop dynamics are unstable, exploration by\nrandom sampling in control space becomes inefficient. We describe a new\nsampling-based algorithm, called CL-RRT#, which leverages ideas from the RRT#\nalgorithm and a variant of the RRT algorithm that generates trajectories using\nclosed-loop prediction. The idea of planning with closed-loop prediction allows\nus to handle complex unstable dynamics and avoids the need to find\ncomputationally hard steering procedures. The search technique presented in the\nRRT# algorithm allows us to improve the solution quality by searching over\nalternative reference trajectories. Numerical simulations using a nonholonomic\nsystem demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach."

Current capturability analysis is based on stance leg\ndynamics, without taking adequate consideration on swing leg. In this paper, we\ncombine capturability-based analysis with swing leg dynamics. We first\nassociate original definition of capturability with a time-margin, which\nencodes a time sequence that can capture the robot. This time-margin\ncapturability requires consideration of swing leg, and we therefore introduce a\nswing leg kernel that acts as a bridge between step time and step length. We\nanalyze N-step capturability with a combined model of swing leg kernels and a\nlinear inverted pendulum model. By analyzing swing leg kernels with different\nparameters, we find that more powerful actuation and longer normalized step\nlength result in greater capturability. We also answer the question whether\nmore steps would give greater capturability. For a given disturbance, we find a\nstep sequence that minimizes actuation. This step sequence is whether a step\ntime sequence or a step length sequence, and this classification is based on\nboundary value problem analysis."

The implementation includes the generation of 3D global\ndescriptors following a Bag-of-Words approach. This allows the generation of\ndimensionality-fixed descriptors from any type of keypoint detector and feature\nextractor combinations. The framework has been designed, structured and\nimplemented in order to be easily extended with different keypoint detectors,\nfeature extractors as well as classification models.\n  The proposed framework has also been used to evaluate the performance of a\nset of already implemented descriptors, when used as input for a specific\nsemantic localization system.

    "summary": "New safety critical systems are about to appear in our everyday life:\nadvanced robots able to interact with humans and perform tasks at home, in\nhospitals , or at work. A hazardous behavior of those systems, induced by\nfailures or extreme environment conditions, may lead to catastrophic\nconsequences. Well-known risk analysis methods used in other critical domains\n(e.g., avion-ics, nuclear, medical, transportation), have to be extended or\nadapted due to the non-deterministic behavior of those systems, evolving in\nunstructured environments. One major challenge is thus to develop methods that\ncan be applied at the very beginning of the development process, to identify\nhazards induced by robot tasks and their interactions with humans. In this\npaper we present a method which is based on an adaptation of a hazard\nidentification technique, HAZOP (Hazard Operability), coupled with a system\ndescription notation, UML (Unified Modeling Language). This systematic approach\nhas been applied successfully in research projects, and is now applied by robot\nmanufacturers. Some results of those studies are presented and discussed to\nexplain the benefits and limits of our method."

    "summary": "Safely integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into civil airspace is contingent\nupon development of a trustworthy collision avoidance system. This paper\nproposes an approach whereby a parameterized resolution logic that is\nconsidered trusted for a given range of its parameters is adaptively tuned\nonline. Specifically, to address the potential conservatism of the resolution\nlogic with static parameters, we present a dynamic programming approach for\nadapting the parameters dynamically based on the encounter state. We compute\nthe adaptation policy offline using a simulation-based approximate dynamic\nprogramming method that accommodates the high dimensionality of the problem.\nNumerical experiments show that this approach improves safety and operational\nperformance compared to the baseline resolution logic, while retaining\ntrustworthiness."

    "summary": "Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains a challenging task. One\nsuch task is to iron a piece of cloth autonomously. Given a roughly flattened\ncloth, the goal is to have an ironing plan that can iteratively apply a regular\niron to remove all the major wrinkles by a robot. We present a novel solution\nto analyze the cloth surface by fusing two surface scan techniques: a curvature\nscan and a discontinuity scan. The curvature scan can estimate the height\ndeviation of the cloth surface, while the discontinuity scan can effectively\ndetect sharp surface features, such as wrinkles. We use this information to\ndetect the regions that need to be pulled and extended before ironing, and the\nother regions where we want to detect wrinkles and apply ironing to remove the\nwrinkles. We demonstrate that our hybrid scan technique is able to capture and\nclassify wrinkles over the surface robustly. Given detected wrinkles, we enable\na robot to iron them using shape features. Experimental results show that using\nour wrinkle analysis algorithm, our robot is able to iron the cloth surface and\neffectively remove the wrinkles."

Social interaction is\ntaken here to minimally require contingent and co-adaptive behaviours from the\ninteracting parties. In this contribution, I seek to show how the\nmemory-centred cognition approach to cognitive architectures can provide an\nmeans of addressing these functions. A number of example implementations are\nbriefly reviewed, particularly focusing on multi-modal alignment as a function\nof experience-based priming. While there is further refinement required to the\ntheory, and implementations based thereon, this approach provides an\ninteresting alternative perspective on the foundations of cognitive\narchitectures to support robots engage in social interactions with humans."

It has been used to develop applications such as\nformation control, distributed tracking, and collaborative search. In this\npaper, we present a complete redesign of the StarL language and its runtime\nsystem which enables us to achieve portability of robot programs across\nplatforms. Thus, the same application program, say, for distributed tracking,\ncan now be compiled and deployed on multiple, heterogeneous robotic platforms.\nTowards portability, this we first define the semantics of StarL programs in a\nway that is largely platform independent, except for a few key\nplatform-dependent parameters that capture the worst-case execution and sensing\ndelays and resolution of sensors. Next, we present a design of the StarL\nruntime system, including a robot controller, that meets the above semantics.\nThe controller consists of a platform-independent path planner implemented\nusing RRTs and a platform-dependent way-point tracker that is implemented using\nthe control commands available for the platform. We demonstrate portability of\nStarL applications using simulation results for two different robotic\nplatforms, and several applications."

    "summary": "Change detection, i.e., anomaly detection from local maps built by a mobile\nrobot at multiple different times, is a challenging problem to solve in\npractice. Most previous work either cannot be applied to scenarios where the\nsize of the map collection is large, or simply assumed that the robot\nself-location is globally known. In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nsimultaneous self-localization and change detection, by reformulating the\nproblem as a map retrieval problem, and propose a local map descriptor with a\ncompressed bag-of-words (BoW) structure as a scalable solution. We make the\nfollowing contributions. (1) To enable a direct comparison of the spatial\nlayout of visual features between different local maps, the origin of the local\nmap coordinate (termed \"viewpoint\") is planned by scene parsing and determined\nby our \"viewpoint planner\" to be invariant against small variations in\nself-location and changes, aiming at providing similar viewpoints for similar\nscenes (i.e., the relevant map pair). (2) We extend the BoW model to enable the\nuse of not only the appearance (e.g., polestar) but also the spatial layout\n(e.g., spatial pyramid) of visual features with respect to the planned\nviewpoint. The key observation is that the planned viewpoint (i.e., the origin\nof local map coordinate) acts as a pseudo viewpoint that is usually required by\nspatial BoW (e.g., SPM) and also by anomaly detection (e.g., NN-d, LOF). (3)\nExperimental results on a challenging \"loop-closing\" scenario show that the\nproposed method outperforms previous BoW methods in self-localization, and\nfurthermore, that the use of both appearance and pose information in change\ndetection produces better results than the use of either information alone."

Recent advances in task learning enable\nhumanoid robots to conduct dexterous manipulation tasks such as grasping\nobjects and assembling parts of furniture. Operating objects without physical\nmovements is an even more challenging task for humanoid robot because effects\nof actions may not be clearly seen in the physical configuration space and\nmeaningful actions could be very complex in a long time horizon. As an example,\nplaying a mobile game in a smart device has such challenges because both swipe\nactions and complex state transitions inside the smart devices in a long time\nhorizon.

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of grasp pose detection in point clouds. We\nfollow a general algorithmic structure that first generates a large set of\n6-DOF grasp candidates and then classifies each of them as a good or a bad\ngrasp. Our focus in this paper is on improving the second step by using depth\nsensor scans from large online datasets to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork. We propose two new representations of grasp candidates, and we\nquantify the effect of using prior knowledge of two forms: instance or category\nknowledge of the object to be grasped, and pretraining the network on simulated\ndepth data obtained from idealized CAD models. Our analysis shows that a more\ninformative grasp candidate representation as well as pretraining and prior\nknowledge significantly improve grasp detection. We evaluate our approach on a\nBaxter Research Robot and demonstrate an average grasp success rate of 93% in\ndense clutter. This is a 20% improvement compared to our prior work."

    "summary": "In recent years, the interdisciplinary research between information science\nand neuroscience has been a hotspot. In this paper, based on recent biological\nfindings, we proposed a new model to mimic visual information processing, motor\nplanning and control in central and peripheral nervous systems of human. Main\nsteps of the model are as follows: 1) Simulating \"where\" pathway in human: the\nSelective Search method is applied to simulate the function of human dorsal\nvisual pathway to localize object candidates; 2) Simulating \"what\" pathway in\nhuman: a Convolutional Deep Belief Network is applied to simulate the\nhierarchical structure and function of human ventral visual pathway for object\nrecognition; 3) Simulating motor planning process in human: habitual motion\nplanning process in human is simulated, and motor commands are generated from\nthe combination of control signals from past experiences; 4) Simulating precise\nmovement control in human: calibrated control signals, which mimic the\nadjustment for movement from cerebellum in human, are generated and updated\nfrom calibration of movement errors in past experiences, and sent to the\nmovement model to achieve high precision. The proposed framework mimics\nstructures and functions of human recognition, visuomotor coordination and\nprecise motor control. Experiments on object localization, recognition and\nmovement control demonstrate that the new proposed model can not only\naccomplish visuomotor coordination tasks, but also achieve high precision\nmovement with learning ability. Meanwhile, the results also prove the validity\nof the introduced mechanisms. Furthermore, the proposed model could be\ngeneralized and applied to other systems, such as mechanical and electrical\nsystems in robotics, to achieve fast response, high precision movement with\nlearning ability."

    "summary": "Object handover is a basic, but essential capability for robots interacting\nwith humans in many applications, e.g., caring for the elderly and assisting\nworkers in manufacturing workshops. It appears deceptively simple, as humans\nperform object handover almost flawlessly. The success of humans, however,\nbelies the complexity of object handover as collaborative physical interaction\nbetween two agents with limited communication. This paper presents a learning\nalgorithm for dynamic object handover, for example, when a robot hands over\nwater bottles to marathon runners passing by the water station. We formulate\nthe problem as contextual policy search, in which the robot learns object\nhandover by interacting with the human. A key challenge here is to learn the\nlatent reward of the handover task under noisy human feedback. Preliminary\nexperiments show that the robot learns to hand over a water bottle naturally\nand that it adapts to the dynamics of human motion. One challenge for the\nfuture is to combine the model-free learning algorithm with a model-based\nplanning approach and enable the robot to adapt over human preferences and\nobject characteristics, such as shape, weight, and surface texture."

We study for the first time in SSL how a\nrobot's learning behavior should be organized, so that the robot can keep\nperforming its task in the case that the original cue becomes unavailable. We\nstudy this persistent form of SSL in the context of a flying robot that has to\navoid obstacles based on distance estimates from the visual cue of stereo\nvision. Over time it will learn to also estimate distances based on monocular\nappearance cues. A strategy is introduced that has the robot switch from stereo\nvision based flight to monocular flight, with stereo vision purely used as\n'training wheels' to avoid imminent collisions. This strategy is shown to be an\neffective approach to the 'feedback-induced data bias' problem as also\nexperienced in learning from demonstration. Both simulations and real-world\nexperiments with a stereo vision equipped AR drone 2.0 show the feasibility of\nthis approach, with the robot successfully using monocular vision to avoid\nobstacles in a 5 x 5 room.

The well-known Adapt-then-Combine (ATC) algorithm is\nalready available in the literature as a useful distributed diffusion-based\nadaptive learning network. However, in the ATC diffusion algorithm, fixed step\nsizes are used in the update equations for velocity vectors and location\nvectors. When the nodes are too far away from the target, such strategies may\nrequire large number of iterations to reach the target. To address this issue,\nin this paper we suggest two modifications on the ATC mobile adaptive network\nto improve its performance. The proposed modifications include (i)\ndistance-based variable step size adjustment at diffusion algorithms to update\nvelocity vectors and location vectors (ii) to use a selective cooperation, by\nchoosing the best nodes at each iteration to reduce the number of\ncommunications.

We consider disturbances that force the robot to\ntemporarily stop and delay its advancement along its planned trajectory which\ncan be used to model, e.g., passing-by humans for whom the robots have to\nyield. Although reactive collision-avoidance methods are often used in this\ncontext, they may lead to deadlocks between robots. We design a multi-robot\ncontrol strategy for executing coordinated trajectories computed by a\nmulti-robot trajectory planner and give a proof that the strategy is safe and\ndeadlock-free even when robots are subject to delaying disturbances. Our\nsimulations show that the proposed strategy scales significantly better with\nthe intensity of disturbances than the naive liveness-preserving approach. The\nempirical results further confirm that the proposed approach is more reliable\nand also more efficient than state-of-the-art reactive techniques."

We dynamically generate goal-directed primitives that create and\nmaintain contact between robot and object at each state expansion during the\nsearch. These primitives focus exploration toward critical areas of\nstate-space, providing tractability to the high-dimensional planning problem.\nWe demonstrate that the use of these primitives, combined with an informative\nyet simple to compute heuristic, improves success rate when compared to a\nplanner that uses only primitives formed from discretizing the robot's action\nspace.

    "summary": "This paper proposes a strategy for a group of deaf and dumb robots, carrying\nclocks from different countries, to meet at a geographical location which is\nnot fixed in advanced. The robots act independently. They can observe others,\ncompute some locations and walk towards those locations. They can only get a\nsnapshot of the locations of other robots but can not detect whether they are\nstatic or in motion. The robots are forgetful; once they have completed their\nmotion they forget their previous locations and observations. Again they decide\nnew destinations to move to. Eventually all the robots compute the same\ndestination and meet there. There exists no global positioning system. As they\nstand, they agree on up and down directions. However, as they do not have any\ncompass, the other directions are not agreed upon. They also do not agree on\nthe clockwise direction. For determining a strategy, we imagine the robots to\nbe points on a three dimensional plane where all the robots are mutually\nvisible to each other always. The strategy we propose has to be obeyed by all\nthe robots independently with respect to their own clock and compass. Initially\nthe robots start from distinct locations. Some dead robots may be present in\nthe system or some may die any time before or after the get together. However,\nthe live robots are not aware of the presence of these dead robots."

    "summary": "This paper describes the development of the Robotarium -- a remotely\naccessible, multi-robot research facility. The impetus behind the Robotarium is\nthat multi-robot testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the\nmulti-agent research cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming\nto develop, operate, and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit\naccess for large groups of researchers and students, which is what the\nRobotarium is remedying by providing users with remote access to a\nstate-of-the-art multi-robot test facility. This paper details the design and\noperation of the Robotarium as well as connects these to the particular\nconsiderations one must take when making complex hardware remotely accessible.\nIn particular, safety must be built in already at the design phase without\noverly constraining which coordinated control programs the users can upload and\nexecute, which calls for minimally invasive safety routines with provable\nperformance guarantees."

    "summary": "The development of autonomous lightweight MAVs, capable of navigating in\nunknown indoor environments, is one of the major challenges in robotics. The\ncomplexity of this challenge comes from constraints on weight and power\nconsumption of onboard sensing and processing devices. In this paper we propose\nthe \"Droplet\" strategy, an avoidance strategy based on stereo vision inputs\nthat outperforms reactive avoidance strategies by allowing constant speed\nmaneuvers while being computationally extremely efficient, and which does not\nneed to store previous images or maps. The strategy deals with nonholonomic\nmotion constraints of most fixed and flapping wing platforms, and with the\nlimited field-of-view of stereo camera systems. It guarantees obstacle-free\nflight in the absence of sensor and motor noise. We first analyze the strategy\nin simulation, and then show its robustness in real-world conditions by\nimplementing it on a 20-gram flapping wing MAV."

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of manipulating a uniformly rotating chain:\nthe chain is rotated at a constant angular speed around a fixed axis using a\nrobotic manipulator. Manipulation is quasi-static in the sense that transitions\nare slow enough for the chain to be always in \"rotational\" equilibrium. The\ncurve traced by the chain in a rotating plane -- its shape function -- can be\ndetermined by a simple force analysis, yet it possesses complex multi-solutions\nbehavior typical of non-linear systems. We prove that the configuration space\nof the uniformly rotating chain is homeomorphic to a two-dimensional surface\nembedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Using that representation, we devise a manipulation\nstrategy for transiting between different rotation modes in a stable and\ncontrolled manner. We demonstrate the strategy on a physical robotic arm\nmanipulating a rotating chain. Finally, we discuss how the ideas developed here\nmight find fruitful applications in the study of other flexible objects, such\nas elastic rods or concentric tubes."

    "summary": "Expansion of today's underwater scenarios and missions necessitates the\nrequestion for robust decision making of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle\n(AUV); hence, design an efficient decision making framework is essential for\nmaximizing the mission productivity in a restricted time. This paper focuses on\ndeveloping a deliberative conflict-free-task assignment architecture\nencompassing a Global Route Planner (GRP) and a Local Path Planner (LPP) to\nprovide consistent motion planning encountering both environmental dynamic\nchanges and a priori knowledge of the terrain, so that the AUV is reactively\nguided to the target of interest in the context of an unknown underwater\nenvironment. The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at\nthe top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management,\nand determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a\nlarge scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety\nconsiderations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each\nspecific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route. Re-planning module\ntends to promote robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the\nenvironmental changes. The experimental results for different simulated\nmissions, demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the\nproposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission\nproductivity, mission time management, and vehicle safety."

It is at the core of much of robotic\nmanipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems\nreasonable then to wish for robots to understand how pushed objects move.\n  In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models\nthat are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are\nthose models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help\nanswer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of\npushing, we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar pushing\nexperiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular pusher and a\npushed object, as well as forces at the interaction.We vary the push\ninteraction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the pushed object,\ncontact position, pushing direction, pushing speed, and pushing acceleration.\nAn industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled\nposition-velocity-acceleration trajectories of the pusher, which give dense\nsamples of positions and forces of uniform quality.\n  We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and\nevaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of\nfrictional pushing in robotics."

    "summary": "Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) can benefit from the\nautomation of common, repetitive or well-defined but ergonomically difficult\ntasks. One such task is the scanning of a pick-up endomicroscopy probe over a\ncomplex, undulating tissue surface in order to enhance the effective\nfield-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci surgical\nrobot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D\nmosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of\nprecision required for high quality large-area mosaic generation, which relies\non sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is\nperformed using a tracking marker attached to the probe. The resulting\nsub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large\nendomicroscopy mo- saics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. It also\nallows the probe to be maintained in an orientation perpendicular to the local\ntissue surface, providing optimal imaging results. Images are streamed from the\nendomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are\ngenerated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the\nsurgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the\nmulti-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to\nenhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale\ninformation over a larger area than could typically be achieved by manual\nscanning."

    "summary": "Integrated Task and Motion Planning (ITMP) for mobile robots in a dynamic\nenvironment with moving obstacles is a challenging research question and\nattracts more and more attentions recently. Most existing methods either\nrestrict to static environments or lack performance guarantees. This motivates\nus to investigate the ITMP problem using formal methods and propose a bottom-up\ncompositional design approach called CoSMoP (Composition of Safe Motion\nPrimitives). Our basic idea is to synthesize a global motion plan through\ncomposing simple local moves and actions, and to achieve its performance\nguarantee through modular and incremental verifications. The design consists of\ntwo steps. First, basic motion primitives are designed and verified locally.\nThen, a global motion path is built upon these certified motion primitives by\nconcatenating them together. In particular, we model the motion primitives as\nhybrid automata and verify their safety through formulating as Differential\nDynamic Logic (d$\\mathcal{L}$). Furthermore, these proven safe motion\nprimitives are composed based on an encoding to Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT) that takes into account the geometric constraints. Since d$\\mathcal{L}$\nallows compositional verification, the sequential composition of the safe\nmotion primitives also preserves safety properties. Therefore, the CoSMoP\ngenerates correct plans for given task specifications that are formally proven\nsafe even for moving obstacles. Illustrative examples are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the methods."

We\npropose a framework called Hierarchical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (HIRL),\nwhich is a model for learning sub-task structure from demonstrations. HIRL\ndecomposes the task into sub-tasks based on transitions that are consistent\nacross demonstrations. These transitions are defined as changes in local\nlinearity w.r.t to a kernel function. Then, HIRL uses the inferred structure to\nlearn reward functions local to the sub-tasks but also handle any global\ndependencies such as sequentiality.\n  We have evaluated HIRL on several standard RL benchmarks: Parallel Parking\nwith noisy dynamics, Two-Link Pendulum, 2D Noisy Motion Planning, and a Pinball\nenvironment. In the parallel parking task, we find that rewards constructed\nwith HIRL converge to a policy with an 80% success rate in 32% fewer time-steps\nthan those constructed with Maximum Entropy Inverse RL (MaxEnt IRL), and with\npartial state observation, the policies learned with IRL fail to achieve this\naccuracy while HIRL still converges. We further find that that the rewards\nlearned with HIRL are robust to environment noise where they can tolerate 1\nstdev. of random perturbation in the poses in the environment obstacles while\nmaintaining roughly the same convergence rate. We find that HIRL rewards can\nconverge up-to 6x faster than rewards constructed with IRL."

A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary\nconditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index\nthat is final rendezvous time.Four evolutionary based path planning methods\nnamely particle swarm optimization (PSO), biogeography-based optimization\n(BBO), differential evolution (DE) and Firefly algorithm (FA) are employed to\nestablish a reactive planner module and provide a numerical solution for the\nproposed NOCP. The objective is to synthesize and analysis the performance and\ncapability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from loitering point\ntoward the rendezvous place through a comprehensive simulation study.The\nproposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering\nsituational awareness of underlying environment, encompassing static and\ndynamic obstacles overwhelmed in spatiotemporal current vectors.This leads to\naccommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field like emergence of\nunpredicted obstacles or variability of current vector filed and turbulent\nregions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and\nsignificant efficiency of the proposed planner in enhancement of the vehicle's\nautonomy in terms of using current force, coping undesired current disturbance\nfor the desired rendezvous purpose. Advantages and shortcoming of all utilized\nmethods are also presented based on the obtained results."

    "summary": "We estimate the state a noisy robot arm and underactuated hand using an\nImplicit Manifold Particle Filter (MPF) informed by touch sensors. As the robot\ntouches the world, its state space collapses to a contact manifold that we\nrepresent implicitly using a signed distance field. This allows us to extend\nthe MPF to higher (six or more) dimensional state spaces. Earlier work (which\nexplicitly represents the contact manifold) only shows the MPF in two or three\ndimensions. Through a series of experiments, we show that the implicit MPF\nconverges faster and is more accurate than a conventional particle filter\nduring periods of persistent contact. We present three methods of sampling the\nimplicit contact manifold, and compare them in experiments."

To this end, a high level reactive\nmission planner and a low level motion planning system are constructed. The\nhigh level system is responsible for task priority assignment and guiding the\nvehicle toward a target of interest considering on-time termination of the\nmission. The lower layer is in charge of generating optimal trajectories based\non sequence of tasks and dynamicity of operating terrain. The mission planner\nis able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates\nwhile the low level planner is capable of coping unexpected changes of the\nterrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a\nresult, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with\ncertain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating\nfield. The computational engine of the mentioned framework is based on the\nbiogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm that is capable of providing\nefficient solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework,\nfirstly, a realistic model of undersea environment is provided based on\nrealistic map data, and then several scenarios, treated as real experiments,\nare designed through the simulation study. Additionally, to show the robustness\nand reliability of the framework, Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out and\nstatistical analysis is performed.

    "summary": "Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with\nlow real autonomy due to battery restrictions. Efficient motion planning and\nmission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and\nfacilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot\ncarry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree\nof autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the\nmission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the\navailable time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In\nthis respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including\nhigher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible\nfor increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while\nguiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by\nseveral waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle's safe\ndeployment in a smaller scale encountering time-varying ocean current and\ndifferent uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean\nenvironment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is\nefficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time\ntermination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and\nlower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly\noptimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the\narchitecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analyze of\nthe captured results from different simulated missions confirm the efficiency\nand inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time\nmanagement, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper\nprioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time."

In this paper, we present two\nlightweight, elastic, bio-inspired tensegrity robotics arms which mitigate this\ndanger while improving their mechanism's functionality. Our solutions feature\nmodular tensegrity structures that function similarly to the human elbow and\nthe human shoulder when connected. Like their biological counterparts, the\nproposed robotic joints are flexible and comply with unanticipated forces. Both\nproposed structures have multiple passive degrees of freedom and four active\ndegrees of freedom (two from the shoulder and two from the elbow). The\nstructural advantages demonstrated by the joints in these manipulators\nillustrate a solution to the fundamental issue of elegantly handling off-axis\ncompliance."

    "summary": "Mobile robot navigation in total or partially unknown environments is still\nan open problem. The path planning algorithms lack completeness and/or\nperformance. Thus, there is the need for complete (i.e., the algorithm\ndetermines in finite time either a solution or correctly reports that there is\nnone) and performance (i.e., with low computational complexity) oriented\nalgorithms which need to perform efficiently in real scenarios. In this paper\nwe evaluate the efficiency of two versions of the A star algorithm for mobile\nrobot navigation inside indoor environments with the help of two software\napplications and the Pioneer 2DX robot. We demonstrate that an improved version\nof the A star algorithm (we call this the fast A star algorithm) which (a\ndifferent version of this algorithm is widely used in video games) can be\nsuccessfully used for indoor mobile robot navigation. We evaluated the two\nversions of the A star algorithm first, by implementing the algorithms in\nsource code and by testing them on a simulator and second, by comparing two\noperation modes of the fast A star algorithm w.r.t. path planning efficiency\n(i.e., completness) and performance (i.e., time need to complete the path\ntraversing) for indoor navigation with the Pioneer 2DX robot. The results\nobtained with the fast A star algorithm are promising and we think that this\nresults can be further improved by tweaking the algorithm and by using an\nadvanced sensor fusion approach (i.e., combine the inputs of multiple robot\nsensors) for better dealing with partially known environments."

We formulate contact manipulation as a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP) in the joint space of robot configurations and object\nposes. The POMDP formulation enables the robot to actively gather information\nand reduce the uncertainty on the object pose. Further, it incorporates all\nmajor constraints for robot manipulation: kinematic reachability,\nself-collision, and collision with obstacles. To solve the POMDP, we apply\nDESPOT, a state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithm. Our approach leverages two\nkey ideas for computational efficiency. First, it performs lazy construction of\na configuration-space lattice by interleaving construction of the lattice and\nonline POMDP planning. Second, it combines online and offline POMDP planning by\nsolving relaxed POMDP offline and using the solution to guide the online search\nalgorithm.

The standard way to\nrepresent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary\nvalues to each grid cell.

We show\nhow this data can be used to discern whether a grasp was successful.\nCo-locating sensing and embedded computation with the actuators greatly\nsimplifies control and system integration. Equipped with a small pump, the hand\nis self-contained and needs only power and data supplied by a single USB\nconnection to a PC. We demonstrate its function by grasping a variety of\nobjects ranging from very small to large and heavy objects weighing more than\nthe hand itself. The presented system nicely illustrates the advantages of soft\nrobotics: low cost, low weight, and intrinsic compliance. We exploit\nmorphological computation to simplify control, which allows successful grasping\nvia underactuation. Grasping indeed relies on morphological computation at\nmultiple levels, ranging from the geometry of the actuator which determines the\nactuator's kinematics, embedded strain sensors to measure curvature, to\nmaximizing contact area and applied force during grasping. Morphological\ncomputation reaches its limitations, however, when objects are too bulky to\nself-align with the gripper or when the state of grasping is of interest. We\ntherefore argue that efficient and reliable grasping also requires not only\nintrinsic compliance, but also embedded sensing and computation. In particular,\nwe show how embedded sensing can be used to detect successful grasps and vary\nthe force exerted onto an object based on local feedback, which is not possible\nusing morphological computation alone."

    "summary": "Simultaneous Localization and Planning (SLAP) under process and measurement\nuncertainties is a challenge. It involves solving a stochastic control problem\nmodeled as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) in a general\nframework. For a convex environment, we propose an optimization-based open-loop\noptimal control problem coupled with receding horizon control strategy to plan\nfor high quality trajectories along which the uncertainty of the state\nlocalization is reduced while the system reaches to a goal state with minimum\ncontrol effort. In a static environment with non-convex state constraints, the\noptimization is modified by defining barrier functions to obtain collision-free\npaths while maintaining the previous goals. By initializing the optimization\nwith trajectories in different homotopy classes and comparing the resultant\ncosts, we improve the quality of the solution in the presence of action and\nmeasurement uncertainties. In dynamic environments with time-varying\nconstraints such as moving obstacles or banned areas, the approach is extended\nto find collision-free trajectories. In this paper, the underlying spaces are\ncontinuous, and beliefs are non-Gaussian. Without obstacles, the optimization\nis a globally convex problem, while in the presence of obstacles it becomes\nlocally convex. We demonstrate the performance of the method on different\nscenarios."

    "summary": "Grid mapping is a well established approach for environment perception in\nrobotic and automotive applications. Early work suggests estimating the\noccupancy state of each grid cell in a robot's environment using a Bayesian\nfilter to recursively combine new measurements with the current posterior state\nestimate of each grid cell. This filter is often referred to as binary Bayes\nfilter (BBF). A basic assumption of classical occupancy grid maps is a\nstationary environment. Recent publications describe bottom-up approaches using\nparticles to represent the dynamic state of a grid cell and outline\nprediction-update recursions in a heuristic manner. This paper defines the\nstate of multiple grid cells as a random finite set, which allows to model the\nenvironment as a stochastic, dynamic system with multiple obstacles, observed\nby a stochastic measurement system. It motivates an original filter called the\nprobability hypothesis density / multi-instance Bernoulli (PHD/MIB) filter in a\ntop-down manner. The paper presents a real-time application serving as a fusion\nlayer for laser and radar sensor data and describes in detail a highly\nefficient parallel particle filter implementation. A quantitative evaluation\nshows that parameters of the stochastic process model affect the filter results\nas theoretically expected and that appropriate process and observation models\nprovide consistent state estimation results."

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a new model of biped locomotion which is composed\nof three linear pendulums (one per leg and one for the whole upper body) to\ndescribe stance, swing and torso dynamics. In addition to double support, this\nmodel has different actuation possibilities in the swing hip and stance ankle\nwhich could be widely used to produce different walking gaits. Without the need\nfor numerical time-integration, closed-form solutions help finding periodic\ngaits which could be simply scaled in certain dimensions to modulate the motion\nonline. Thanks to linearity properties, the proposed model can provide a\ncomputationally fast platform for model predictive controllers to predict the\nfuture and consider meaningful inequality constraints to ensure feasibility of\nthe motion. Such property is coming from describing dynamics with joint torques\ndirectly and therefore, reflecting hardware limitations more precisely, even in\nthe very abstract high level template space. The proposed model produces\nhuman-like torque and ground reaction force profiles and thus, compared to\npoint-mass models, it is more promising for precise control of humanoid robots.\nDespite being linear and lacking many other features of human walking like CoM\nexcursion, knee flexion and ground clearance, we show that the proposed model\ncan predict one of the main optimality trends in human walking, i.e. nonlinear\nspeed-frequency relationship. In this paper, we mainly focus on describing the\nmodel and its capabilities, comparing it with human data and calculating\noptimal human gait variables. Setting up control problems and advanced\nbiomechanical analysis still remain for future works."

Taking\nadvantage of linear equations and closed-form solutions of 3LP, the proposed\ncontroller can project the state of the robot at any time during the phase back\nto a certain event for which, a discrete LQR controller is designed. After the\nprojection, a proper control policy is generated by the expert discrete\ncontroller and used online. This projecting architecture reacts to disturbances\nwith minimal delay and compared to discrete controllers, it provides superior\nperformance in recovering intermittent external pushes. Further analysis of\nclosed-loop eigenvalues and disturbance rejection shows that the proposed\ntime-projecting controller has strong stabilization properties. Controllable\nregions also show that the projecting architecture covers most of the maximal\ncontrollable set of states. It is computationally much faster than model\npredictive controllers, but still optimal."

    "summary": "In this paper, we give a double twist to the problem of planning under\nuncertainty. State-of-the-art planners seek to minimize the localization\nuncertainty by only considering the geometric structure of the scene. In this\npaper, we argue that motion planning for vision-controlled robots should be\nperception aware in that the robot should also favor texture-rich areas to\nminimize the localization uncertainty during a goal-reaching task. Thus, we\ndescribe how to optimally incorporate the photometric information (i.e.,\ntexture) of the scene, in addition to the the geometric one, to compute the\nuncertainty of vision-based localization during path planning. To avoid the\ncaveats of feature-based localization systems (i.e., dependence on feature type\nand user-defined thresholds), we use dense, direct methods. This allows us to\ncompute the localization uncertainty directly from the intensity values of\nevery pixel in the image. We also describe how to compute trajectories online,\nconsidering also scenarios with no prior knowledge about the map. The proposed\nframework is general and can easily be adapted to different robotic platforms\nand scenarios. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with extensive\nexperiments in both simulated and real-world environments using a\nvision-controlled micro aerial vehicle."

    "summary": "Automated vehicles (AVs) must be evaluated thoroughly before their release\nand deployment. A widely-used evaluation approach is the Naturalistic-Field\nOperational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public\nroads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are\ntime-consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an\naccelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate\nmotions of the primary other vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in\nsimulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins\nis the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe\nlane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data\ncollected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program.\nThe cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected\nhuman driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving\nthe statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in\nnon-accelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The Cross Entropy method is\nused to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies\nof occurrence of conflicts, crashes and injuries are estimated for a modeled\nautomated vehicle, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2,000 to 20,000.\nIn other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1,000 miles will\nexpose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million\nmiles of real-world driving to encounter. This technique thus has the potential\nto reduce greatly the development and validation time for AVs."

    "summary": "Path planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is a challenging problem\ndue to the added time dimension in search space. In approaches that ignore the\ntime dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is\nunavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally\nsub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness,\nit is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of\nadaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion\nplanning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the\ncontext of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the\nidea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic\nenvironments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model.\nSpecifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions\nof the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a\nlow-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete\nand is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost\nsub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of\n3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show\nthat the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over\n4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates\nsignificantly from the one suggested by the heuristic."

However, as humanoid robots enter more\ncomplex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As\nwe leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that\ncan compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the\nwhole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and\ninteraction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The\nmotion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing\nforce and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum\ncomputation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a\ndedicated solver.

    "summary": "RoboCup soccer competitions are considered among the most challenging\nmulti-robot adversarial environments, due to their high dynamism and the\npartial observability of the environment. In this paper we introduce a method\nbased on a combination of Monte Carlo search and data aggregation (MCSDA) to\nadapt discrete-action soccer policies for a defender robot to the strategy of\nthe opponent team. By exploiting a simple representation of the domain, a\nsupervised learning algorithm is trained over an initial collection of data\nconsisting of several simulations of human expert policies. Monte Carlo policy\nrollouts are then generated and aggregated to previous data to improve the\nlearned policy over multiple epochs and games. The proposed approach has been\nextensively tested both on a soccer-dedicated simulator and on real robots.\nUsing this method, our learning robot soccer team achieves an improvement in\nball interceptions, as well as a reduction in the number of opponents' goals.\nTogether with a better performance, an overall more efficient positioning of\nthe whole team within the field is achieved."

    "summary": "To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces\nit is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing\na task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very\nchallenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in\ncollaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are\nindeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such\nmotions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect\nto an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their\npartner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the\nabove cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function\nwhich \"explains\" the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example\ntrajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly\ntask using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost\nfunction from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the\nhuman's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively\nre-planning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning\nalgorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer STOMP, it plans for a 23 DoF\nhuman kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator\nand obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our\nmethod outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that\nour method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a\nrobot share the workspace."

We examined how\nparticipants reacted to the robot's error, its subsequent request for help and\nhow it changed their perception of the robot with respect to perceived\nintelligence, likability, and task contribution. As interaction scenario we\nused a game of building Lego models performed by user dyads. In total 38\nparticipants interacted with the robot and helped in malfunctioning situations.\nWe report two major findings: (1) in user dyads, the user who gave the last\ncommand followed by the user who is closer is more likely to help (2)\nmalfunctions that can be actively fixed by the user seem not to negatively\nimpact perceived intelligence and likability ratings.

Current research\nfocuses on learning the semantic of environments based on their spatial\nlocation, geometry and appearance. Many methods to tackle this problem have\nbeen proposed, but the lack of a uniform representation, as well as standard\nbenchmarking suites, prevents their direct comparison. In this paper, we\npropose a standardization in the representation of semantic maps, by defining\nan easily extensible formalism to be used on top of metric maps of the\nenvironments.

    "summary": "We consider a problem called task ordering with path uncertainty (TOP-U)\nwhere multiple robots are provided with a set of task locations to visit in a\nbounded environment, but the length of the path between a pair of task\nlocations is initially known only coarsely by the robots. The objective of the\nrobots is to find the order of tasks that reduces the path length (or, energy\nexpended) to visit the task locations in such a scenario. To solve this\nproblem, we propose an abstraction called a task reachability graph (TRG) that\nintegrates the task ordering with the path planning by the robots. The TRG is\nupdated dynamically based on inter-task path costs calculated using a\nsampling-based motion planner, and, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based technique\nthat calculates the belief in the current path costs based on the environment\nperceived by the robot's sensors and task completion information received from\nother robots. We then describe a Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based algorithm\nthat can select the paths that reduce the overall path length to visit the task\nlocations and a coordination algorithm that resolves path conflicts between\nrobots. We have shown analytically that our task selection algorithm finds the\nlowest cost path returned by the motion planner, and, that our proposed\ncoordination algorithm is deadlock free. We have also evaluated our algorithm\non simulated Corobot robots within different environments while varying the\nnumber of task locations, obstacle geometries and number of robots, as well as\non physical Corobot robots. Our results show that the TRG-based approach can\nperform considerably better in planning and locomotion times, and number of\nre-plans, while traveling almost-similar distances as compared to a closest\nfirst, no uncertainty (CFNU) task selection algorithm."

    "summary": "This paper addresses 6-DOF (degree-of-freedom) tactile localization, i.e. the\npose estimation of tridimensional objects given tactile measurements. This\nestimation problem is fundamental for the operation of autonomous robots that\nare often required to manipulate and grasp objects whose pose is a-priori\nunknown. The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for\nreal-time operation and the multimodality of the involved probability\ndistributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear\nfiltering techniques. Following a Bayesian approach, this paper proposes a\nnovel and effective algorithm, named Memory Unscented Particle Filter (MUPF),\nwhich solves the 6-DOF localization problem recursively in real-time by only\nexploiting contact point measurements. MUPF combines a modified particle filter\nthat incorporates a sliding memory of past measurements to better handle\nmultimodal distributions, along with the unscented Kalman filter that moves the\nparticles towards regions of the search space that are more likely with the\nmeasurements. The performance of the proposed MUPF algorithm has been assessed\nboth in simulation and on a real robotic system equipped with tactile sensors\n(i.e., the iCub humanoid robot). The experiments show that the algorithm\nprovides accurate and reliable localization even with a low number of particles\nand, hence, is compatible with real-time requirements."

    "summary": "In this work we present a trajectory Optimization framework for whole-body\nmotion planning through contacts. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can\nbe applied to automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a\nquadruped robot. In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify\ncontact switches, timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct\noutcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics\nof the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of\nthe robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight\ndifferent tasks, which would require very different control structures when\nsolved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization\napproach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and\nwithout any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated\nour approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that\noptimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with\nmultiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized\ntrajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware."

    "summary": "Existing techniques for motion imitation often suffer a certain level of\nlatency due to their computational overhead or a large set of correspondence\nsamples to search. To achieve real-time imitation with small latency, we\npresent a framework in this paper to reconstruct motion on humanoids based on\nsparsely sampled correspondence. The imitation problem is formulated as finding\nthe projection of a point from the configuration space of a human's poses into\nthe configuration space of a humanoid. An optimal projection is defined as the\none that minimizes a back-projected deviation among a group of candidates,\nwhich can be determined in a very efficient way. Benefited from this\nformulation, effective projections can be obtained by using sparse\ncorrespondence. Methods for generating these sparse correspondence samples have\nalso been introduced. Our method is evaluated by applying the human's motion\ncaptured by a RGB-D sensor to a humanoid in real-time. Continuous motion can be\nrealized and used in the example application of tele-operation."

    "summary": "Environment perception is a crucial ability for robot's interaction into an\nenvironment. One of the first steps in this direction is the combined problem\nof simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A new method, called G-SLAM,\nis proposed, where the map is considered as a set of scattered points in the\ncontinuous space followed by a probability that states the existence of an\nobstacle in the subsequent point in space. A probabilistic approach with\nparticle filters for the robot's pose estimation and an adaptive recursive\nalgorithm for the map's probability distribution estimation is presented. Key\nfeature of the G-SLAM method is the adaptive repositioning of the scattered\npoints and their convergence around obstacles.

We evaluate IOS-MP as it scales with respect to dimensionality and\ncomplexity, as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-DOF manipulator for\ntasks specified using goal configurations and workspace goal regions."

    "summary": "Effective SLAM using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its\nsimplicity. However, when compared to trajectory planning methods using\ndepth-based SLAM, Monocular SLAM in loop does need additional considerations.\nOne main reason being that for the optimization, in the form of Bundle\nAdjustment (BA), to be robust, the SLAM system needs to scan the area for a\nreasonable duration. Most monocular SLAM systems do not tolerate large camera\nrotations between successive views and tend to breakdown. Other reasons for\nMonocular SLAM failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the Essential\nMatrix, feature-sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart\nfrom BA. This paper presents a novel formulation based on Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the SLAM generated\noutputs (scene structure and camera motion) do not deviate largely from their\ntrue values. Quintessentially, the RL framework successfully learns the\notherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that\nresult in trajectories that do not cause failure of SLAM, which are almost\nintractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation. We show\nsystematically in simulations how the quality of the SLAM map and trajectory\ndramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using RL."

Our approach uses a\nstructured-light 3D scanner for patient-to-robot and image-to-patient\ncalibration, which in turn is used to plan 3D ultrasound trajectories. These\nMRI-based trajectories are followed autonomously by the robot and are further\nrefined online using automatic MRI/US registration. Despite the low spatial\nresolution of structured light scanners, the initial planned acquisition path\ncan be followed with an accuracy of 2.46 +/- 0.96 mm. This leads to a good\ninitialization of the MRI/US registration: the 3D-scan-based alignment for\nplanning and acquisition shows an accuracy (distance between planned ultrasound\nand MRI) of 4.47 mm, and 0.97 mm after an online-update of the calibration\nbased on a closed loop registration."

    "summary": "The humanoid robot iCub is a research platform of the Fondazione Istituto\nItaliano di Tecnologia (IIT), spread among different institutes around the\nworld. In the most recent version of iCub, the robot is equipped with stronger\nlegs and bigger feet that allow it to perform balancing and walking motions\nthat were not possible with the first generations. Despite the new legs\nhardaware, walking has been rarely performed on the iCub robot, so in this work\nthe objective is to implement walking motions on the robot, from which we want\nto analyze its walking capabilities. We developed software modules based on\nextensions of classic techniques such as the ZMP based pattern generator and\nposition control to identify which are the characteristics as well as\nlimitations of the robot against different walking tasks in order to give the\nusers a reference of the performance of the robot. Most of the experiments have\nbeen performed with HeiCub, a reduced version of iCub without arms and head."

    "summary": "Linear models for control and motion generation of humanoid robots have\nreceived significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well\nknown theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational\nadvantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as\nlocomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this\npaper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization\nbased on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex;\nhowever, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as\na single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be\nvery efficiently optimized. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that this\nrelaxation is tight and therefore useful for multi-contact planning. This\nconvex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contacts\nlocation using a mixed integer program, which can be solved in realtime. This\nbecomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined\nstepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact\nlocation is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several\nmulti-contact scenarios for humanoid robot."

We reduce its computation to a convex hull of (dual) 2D\npoints, for which optimal O(n log n) algorithms are readily available. This\nreformulation brings a significant speedup compared to previous methods, which\nallows us to compute time-varying contact-stability criteria fast enough for\nthe control loop. Next, we propose a conservative trajectory-wide\ncontact-stability criterion, which can be derived from COM-acceleration volumes\nat marginal cost and directly applied in a model-predictive controller.

    "summary": "It has long been hoped that model-based control will improve tracking\nperformance while maintaining or increasing compliance. This hope hinges on\nhaving or being able to estimate an accurate inverse dynamics model. As a\nresult, substantial effort has gone into modeling and estimating dynamics\n(error) models. Most recent research has focused on learning the true inverse\ndynamics using data points mapping observed accelerations to the torques used\nto generate them. Unfortunately, if the initial tracking error is bad, such\nlearning processes may train substantially off-distribution to predict well on\nactual observed acceleration rather then the desired accelerations. This work\ntakes a different approach. We define a class of gradient-based online learning\nalgorithms we term Direct Online Optimization for Modeling Errors in Dynamics\n(DOOMED) that directly minimize an objective measuring the divergence between\nactual and desired accelerations. Our objective is defined in terms of the true\nsystem's unknown dynamics and is therefore impossible to evaluate. However, we\nshow that its gradient is measurable online from system data. We develop a\nnovel adaptive control approach based on running online learning to directly\ncorrect (inverse) dynamics errors in real time using the data stream from the\nrobot to accurately achieve desired accelerations during execution."

By using this method, we do not need to try to detect the poses\nof all objects included in the pile at every picking trial. Assuming the 3D\nvision sensor attached at the wrist of a manipulator, we first explain a method\nto determine the pose of a 3D vision sensor maximizing the visibility of\nrandomly stacked objects. Then, we explain a method for detecting the poses of\nrandomly stacked objects.

Unlike a fully centralized scheme that requires, at\neach timestep, information from the entire team to be gathered together and be\nprocessed by a single device, our algorithm only requires that the robots\ncommunicate with a central command unit at the time of a measurement update.\nEvery robot only needs to propagate and update its own state estimate, while\nthe central command unit maintains track of cross-covariances. Therefore, the\ncomputational and storage cost per robot in terms of the size of the team is of\norder O(1). Moreover, when the system model is linear the algorithm is robust\nto occasional in-network communication link failures while the updated\nestimates of the robots receiving the update message are of minimum variance at\nthat given timestep. For problems with nonlinear robot models, our algorithm\nunder message drop-out provides a suboptimal solutions because of the\nlinearization approximation similar to the Extended Kalman filter model.

Planners that perform a purely geometric search are prohibitively slow\nfor solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration\nspace. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many\nvariables but cannot represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required\nin manipulation. We present the FFRob algorithm for solving task and motion\nplanning problems. First, we introduce Extended Action Specification (EAS) as a\ngeneral purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as\nconditions. We adapt heuristic search ideas for solving \\proc{strips} planning\nproblems, particularly delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We\nthen apply the EAS representation and planners to manipulation problems\nresulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning\nproblems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query\nroadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under\ndifferent placements of movable objects. This structure enables the EAS planner\nto efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric and kinematic\nplanning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal.\nAdditionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has finite\nexpected runtime.

    "summary": "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a well-known estimation method used in\nmany robotic and computer vision applications. Under Gaussian assumption, the\nMLE converts to a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. Efficient solutions to\nNLS exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until\nconvergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of\nthe mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too\nexpensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localisation and\nmapping (SLAM) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data\nassociation, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next\nbest view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance\nrecovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general\nperformed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step\nand its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may\nbecome highly computationally demanding. This paper introduces a general\nframework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the\nincremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient\nestimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that,\nwe propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state\nrepresentation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures\nto integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state\nrepresentation. SLAM++ differs from existing implementations by performing all\nthe matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation\nand arithmetic operations.

This paper studies occupancy grids from the\nmotion planning perspective and proposes a mapping method that provides richer\ndata (map) for the purpose of planning and collision avoidance. Typically, in\noccupancy grid mapping, each cell contains a single number representing the\nprobability of cell being occupied. This leads to conflicts in the map, and\nmore importantly inconsistency between the map error and reported confidence\nvalues. Such inconsistencies pose challenges for the planner that relies on the\ngenerated map for planning motions.

    "summary": "This paper proposes control laws ensuring the stabilization of a time-varying\ndesired joint trajectory, as well as joint limit avoidance, in the case of\nfully-actuated manipulators. The key idea is to perform a parametrization of\nthe feasible joint space in terms of exogenous states. It follows that the\ncontrol of these states allows for joint limit avoidance. One of the main\noutcomes of this paper is that position terms in control laws are replaced by\nparametrized terms, where joint limits must be avoided. Stability and\nconvergence of time-varying reference trajectories obtained with the proposed\nmethod are demonstrated to be in the sense of Lyapunov. The introduced control\nlaws are verified by carrying out experiments on two degrees-of-freedom of the\nhumanoid robot iCub."

    "summary": "We study the problem of simultaneously reconstructing a polygonal room and a\ntrajectory of a device equipped with a (nearly) collocated omnidirectional\nsource and receiver. The device measures arrival times of echoes of pulses\nemitted by the source and picked up by the receiver. No prior knowledge about\nthe device's trajectory is required. Most existing approaches addressing this\nproblem assume multiple sources or receivers, or they assume that some of these\nare static, serving as beacons. Unlike earlier approaches, we take into account\nthe measurement noise and various constraints on the geometry by formulating\nthe solution as a minimizer of a cost function similar to \\emph{stress} in\nmultidimensional scaling. We study uniqueness of the reconstruction from\nfirst-order echoes, and we show that in addition to the usual invariance to\nrigid motions, new ambiguities arise for important classes of rooms and\ntrajectories. We support our theoretical developments with a number of\nnumerical experiments."

    "summary": "If autonomous vehicles are to be widely accepted, we need to ensure their\nsafe operation. For this reason, verification and validation (V&V) approaches\nmust be developed that are suitable for this domain. Model checking is a formal\ntechnique which allows us to exhaustively explore the paths of an abstract\nmodel of a system. Using a probabilistic model checker such as PRISM, we may\ndetermine properties such as the expected time for a mission, or the\nprobability that a specific mission failure occurs. However, model checking of\ncomplex systems is difficult due to the loss of information during abstraction.\nThis is especially so when considering systems such as autonomous vehicles\nwhich are subject to external influences. An alternative solution is the use of\nMonte Carlo simulation to explore the results of a continuous-time model of the\nsystem. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the approach is not\nexhaustive as not all executions of the system are analysed. We are therefore\ninterested in developing a framework for formal verification of autonomous\nvehicles, using Monte Carlo simulation to inform and validate our symbolic\nmodels during the initial stages of development. In this paper, we present a\ncontinuous-time model of a quadrotor unmanned aircraft undertaking an\nautonomous mission. We employ this model in Monte Carlo simulation to obtain\nspecific mission properties which will inform the symbolic models employed in\nformal verification."

To increase the diversity of\nconfigurations, we add boundary interaction to our model.

On the one hand, based on the shortest path from the start point\nto the goal point, this path planner can choose the best moving directions of\nthe MR, which helps to reach the target point as soon as possible. On the other\nhand, with an intelligent obstacle avoidance, our method can find the target\npoint with the near-shortest path length while avoiding some infinite loop\ntraps of several obstacles in unknown environments. The combination of two\napproaches helps the MR to reach the target point with a very reliable\nalgorithm.

    "summary": "In the classical context of robotic mapping and localization, map matching is\ntypically defined as the task of finding a rigid transformation (i.e., 3DOF\nrotation/translation on the 2D moving plane) that aligns the query and\nreference maps built by mobile robots. This definition is valid in loop-rich\ntrajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise\nmaps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging\nautonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less\ntrajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we\npropose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our\nstudy is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in\neither the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the\nmerged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with\ndiscriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which\nefficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and\n(2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in\nshape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a\npreemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching\nhypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel\ncollection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published\nNorth Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The\nresults obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves\non previous map-matching approaches."

However, state-of-the-art algorithms\nsuffer from $O(n^3)$ complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody\nsystems with a large number of degrees of freedom, $n$, in generalized\ncoordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that\nevaluates DEL equations in $O(n)$, which scales up well for complex multibody\nsystems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm,\nour key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather\nthan for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method\nthat exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also $O(n)$, to\navoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations.

Indeed,\nas the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of robots expand, they will\nbe expected to have an improved capacity for making moral judgements. We\npresent a control architecture that supplements existing robot controllers.\nThis so-called Ethical Layer ensures robots behave according to a predetermined\nset of ethical rules by predicting the outcomes of possible actions and\nevaluating the predicted outcomes against those rules. To validate the proposed\narchitecture, we implement it on a humanoid robot so that it behaves according\nto Asimov's laws of robotics.

    "summary": "Guided policy search is a method for reinforcement learning that trains a\ngeneral policy for accomplishing a given task by guiding the learning of the\npolicy with multiple guiding distributions. Guided policy search relies on\nlearning an underlying dynamical model of the environment and then, at each\niteration of the algorithm, using that model to gradually improve the policy.\nThis model, though, often makes the assumption that the environment dynamics\nare markovian, e.g., depend only on the current state and control signal. In\nthis paper we apply guided policy search to a problem with non-markovian\ndynamics. Specifically, we apply it to the problem of pouring a precise amount\nof liquid from a cup into a bowl, where many of the sensor measurements\nexperience non-trivial amounts of delay. We show that, with relatively simple\nstate augmentation, guided policy search can be extended to non-markovian\ndynamical systems, where the non-markovianess is caused by delayed sensor\nreadings."

    "summary": "The design of mobile autonomous robots is challenging due to the limited\non-board resources such as processing power and energy. A promising approach is\nto generate intelligent schedules that trade off reduced resource consumption\nfor a slightly lower but still acceptable level of performance. In this paper,\nwe provide a framework to aid designers in exploring such resource-performance\ntrade-offs and finding schedules for mobile robots, guided by questions such as\n\"what is the minimum resource budget required to achieve a given level of\nperformance?\" The framework is based on a quantitative multi-objective\nverification technique which, for a collection of possibly conflicting\nobjectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all the optimal trade-offs\nthat are achievable. The designer then selects a specific Pareto point based on\nthe resource constraints and desired performance level, and a\ncorrect-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is automatically\ngenerated. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on several robotic\nscenarios with encouraging results."

    "summary": "Uncertainty is a major difficulty in endowing robots with autonomy. Robots\noften fail due to unexpected events. In robot contact tasks are often design to\nempirically look for force thresholds to define state transitions in a Markov\nchain or finite state machines. Such design is prone to failure in unstructured\nenvironments, when due to external disturbances or erroneous models, such\nthresholds are met, and lead to state transitions that are false-positives. The\nfocus of this paper is to perform high-level state estimation of robot\nbehaviors and task output for robot contact tasks. Our approach encodes raw\nlow-level 3D cartesian trajectories and converts them into a high level (HL)\naction grammars. Cartesian trajectories can be segmented and encoded in a way\nthat their dynamic properties, or \"texture\" are preserved. Once an action\ngrammar is generated, a classifier is trained to detect current behaviors and\nultimately the task output. The system executed HL state estimation for task\noutput verification with an accuracy of 86%, and behavior monitoring with an\naverage accuracy of: 72%. The significance of the work is the transformation of\ndifficult-to-use raw low-level data to HL data that enables robust behavior and\ntask monitoring. Monitoring is useful for failure correction or other\ndeliberation in high-level planning, programming by demonstration, and\nhuman-robot interaction to name a few."

    "summary": "Robotic failure is all too common in unstructured robot tasks. Despite well\ndesigned controllers, robots often fail due to unexpected events. How do robots\nmeasure unexpected events? Many do not. Most robots are driven by the\nsenseplan- act paradigm, however more recently robots are working with a\nsense-plan-act-verify paradigm. In this work we present a principled\nmethodology to bootstrap robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we\nare trying to answer the question, what did the robot do? To this end, we\nhypothesize that all noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be\neffectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by\nmeaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench\ninformation represents a sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary\nforming sets of words or sentences, such that each subtask is uniquely\nrepresented by a word set. Such sets can be classified using statistical or\nmachine learning techniques. We use SVMs and Mondrian Forests to classify\ncontacts tasks both in simulation and in real robots for one and dual arm\nscenarios showing the general robustness of the approach. The contribution of\nour work is the presentation of a simple but generalizable semantic scheme that\nenables a robot to understand its high level state.

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of safe mission planning of dynamic systems\noperating under uncertain environments. Much of the prior work on achieving\nrobust and safe control requires solving second-order cone programs (SOCP).\nUnfortunately, existing general purpose SOCP methods are often infeasible for\nreal-time robotic tasks due to high memory and computational requirements\nimposed by existing general optimization methods. The key contribution of this\npaper is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for SOCP that would enable\nrobust and safe mission planning on-board robots in real-time. Our algorithm\ndoes not have any external dependency, can efficiently utilize warm start\nprovided in safe planning settings, and in fact leads to significant speed up\nover standard optimization packages (like SDPT3) for even standard SOCP\nproblems. For example, for a standard quadrotor problem, our method leads to\nspeedup of 1000x over SDPT3 without any deterioration in the solution quality.\n  Our method is based on two insights: a) SOCPs can be interpreted as\noptimizing a function over a polytope with infinite sides, b) a linear function\ncan be efficiently optimized over this polytope. We combine the above\nobservations with a novel utilization of Wolfe's algorithm to obtain an\nefficient optimization method that can be easily implemented on small embedded\ndevices. In addition to the above mentioned algorithm, we also design a\ntwo-level sensing method based on Gaussian Process for complex obstacles with\nnon-linear boundaries such as a cylinder."

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the idea of improving the performance of grasp\ndetection by viewing an object to be grasped from a series of different\nperspectives. Grasp detection is an approach to perception for grasping whereby\nrobotic grasp configurations are detected directly from point cloud or RGB\nsensor data. This paper focuses on the situation where the camera or depth\nsenor is mounted near the robotic hand. In this context, there are at least two\nways in which viewpoint can affect grasp performance. First, a \"good\" viewpoint\nmight enable the robot to detect more/better grasps because it has a better\nview of graspable parts of an object. Second, by detecting grasps from arm\nconfigurations nearby the final grasp configuration, it might be possible to\nreduce the impact of kinematic modelling errors on the last stage of grasp\nsynthesis just prior to contact. Both of these effects are particularly\nrelevant to inexpensive robotic arms. We evaluate them experimentally both in\nsimulation and on-line with a robot. We find that both of the effects mentioned\nabove exist, but that the second one (reducing kinematic modelling errors)\nseems to have the most impact in practice."

    "summary": "We have been developing a paradigm, which we refer to as\nLearning-from-observation, for a robot to automatically acquire what-to-do\nthrough observation of human performance. Since a simple mimicking method to\nrepeat exact joint angles does not work due to the kinematic and dynamic\ndifference between a human and a robot, the method introduces an intermediate\nsymbolic representation, task models, to conceptually represent what-to-do\nthrough observation. Then, these task models are mapped appropriate robot\nmotions depending on each robot hardware. This paper presents task models,\ndesigned based on the Labanotation, for upper body movements of humanoid\nrobots. Given a human motion sequence, we first analyze the motions of the\nupper body, and extract certain fixed poses at certain key frames. These key\nposes are translated into states represented by Labanotation symbols. Then,\ntask models, identified from the state transitions, are mapped to robot\nmovements on a particular robot hardware. Since the task models based on\nLabanotation are independent from different robot hardware, we can share the\nsame observation module; we only need task mapping modules depending on\ndifferent robot hardware. The system was implemented and demonstrated that\nthree different robots can automatically mimic human upper body motions with\nsatisfactory level of resemblance."

    "summary": "Bio-inspired methods can provide efficient solutions to perform autonomous\nlanding for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Flying insects such as honeybees perform\nvertical landings by keeping flow divergence constant. This leads to an\nexponential decay of both height and vertical velocity, and allows for smooth\nand safe landings. However, the presence of noise and delay in obtaining flow\ndivergence estimates will cause instability of the landing when the control\ngains are not adapted to the height. In this paper, we propose a strategy that\ndeals with this fundamental problem of optical flow control. The key to the\nstrategy lies in the use of a recent theory that allows the MAV to see distance\nby means of its control instability. At the start of a landing, the MAV detects\nthe height by means of an oscillating movement and sets the control gains\naccordingly. Then, during descent, the gains are reduced exponentially, with\nmechanisms in place to reduce or increase the gains if the actual trajectory\ndeviates too much from an ideal constant divergence landing. Real-world\nexperiments demonstrate stable landings of the MAV in both indoor and windy\noutdoor environments."

    "summary": "Recent advances have been made in learning of grasps for fully actuated\nhands. A typical approach learns the target locations of finger links on the\nobject. When a new object must be grasped, new finger locations are generated,\nand a collision free reach-to-grasp trajectory is planned. This assumes a\ncollision free trajectory to the final grasp. This is not possible with\nunderactuated hands, which cannot be guaranteed to avoid contact, and in fact\nexploit contacts with the object during grasping, so as to reach an equilibrium\nstate in which the object is held securely. Unfortunately, these contact\ninteractions are i) not directly controllable, and ii) hard to monitor during a\nreal grasp. We overcome these problems so as to permit learning of\ntransferrable grasps for underactuated hands. We make two main technical\ninnovations. First, we model contact interactions during the grasp implicitly.\nWe do this by modelling motor commands that lead reliably to the equilibrium\nstate, rather than modelling contact changes themselves. This alters our\nreach-to-grasp model. Second, we extend our contact model learning algorithm to\nwork with multiple training examples for each grasp type. This requires the\nability to learn which parts of the hand reliably interact with the object\nduring a particular grasp. Our approach learns from a rigid body simulation.\nThis enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated\nhand from a variety of poses. From nine training grasps on three objects the\nmethod transferred grasps to previously unseen, novel objects, that differ\nsignificantly from the training objects, with an 80% success rate."

    "summary": "Learning from demonstration for motion planning is an ongoing research topic.\nIn this paper we present a model that is able to learn the complex mapping from\nraw 2D-laser range findings and a target position to the required steering\ncommands for the robot. To our best knowledge, this work presents the first\napproach that learns a target-oriented end-to-end navigation model for a\nrobotic platform. Furthermore, the supervised model training is based on expert\ndemonstrations generated in simulation with an existing motion planner. We\ndemonstrate that the learned navigation model is directly transferable to\npreviously unseen virtual and, more interestingly, real-world environments. It\ncan safely navigate the robot through obstacle-cluttered environments to reach\nthe desired targets. We present an extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation of the neural network-based motion planner, and compare it to a\ngrid-based global approach, both in simulation and in real-world experiments."

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce an informative path planning (IPP) framework for\nactive classification using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our algorithm uses\na combination of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to\nrefine the planned trajectory in continuous 3D space while satisfying dynamic\nconstraints. Our approach is evaluated on the application of weed detection for\nprecision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an\noccupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to information-theoretic\nobjectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our\napproach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the\neffects of different planning strategies. Our results show that the proposed\nalgorithm builds maps with over 50% lower entropy compared to traditional\n\"lawnmower\" coverage in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the planning\nscheme on a multirotor platform with different artificial farmland set-ups."

    "summary": "This work provides an architecture to enable robotic grasp planning via shape\ncompletion. Shape completion is accomplished through the use of a 3D\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). The network is trained on our own new open\nsource dataset of over 440,000 3D exemplars captured from varying viewpoints.\nAt runtime, a 2.5D pointcloud captured from a single point of view is fed into\nthe CNN, which fills in the occluded regions of the scene, allowing grasps to\nbe planned and executed on the completed object. Runtime shape completion is\nvery rapid because most of the computational costs of shape completion are\nborne during offline training. We explore how the quality of completions vary\nbased on several factors. These include whether or not the object being\ncompleted existed in the training data and how many object models were used to\ntrain the network. We also look at the ability of the network to generalize to\nnovel objects allowing the system to complete previously unseen objects at\nruntime. Finally, experimentation is done both in simulation and on actual\nrobotic hardware to explore the relationship between completion quality and the\nutility of the completed mesh model for grasping."

To this end, it is essential for them to estimate on-board\nthe relative location of their neighbors. The challenge lies in limiting the\nmass and processing burden needed to enable this. We developed a relative\nlocalization method that only requires the MAVs to communicate via their\nwireless transceiver. Communication allows the exchange of on-board states\n(velocity, height, and orientation), while the signal-strength provides range\ndata. These quantities are fused to provide a full relative location estimate.\nWe used our method to tackle the problem of collision avoidance in tight areas.\nThe system was tested with a team of AR.Drones flying in a 4mx4m area and with\nminiature drones of ~50g in a 2mx2m area. The MAVs were able to track their\nrelative positions and fly several minutes without collisions. Our\nimplementation used Bluetooth to communicate between the drones.

For most parallel manipulators the\ndirect kinematics is challenging. In this paper, for the first time a fast and\nefficient Homotopy Continuation Method, called the Ostrowski Homotopy\ncontinuation method has been implemented to solve the direct and inverse\nkinematics problem of the parallel manipulators. This method has advantage over\nconventional numerical iteration methods, which is not rely on the initial\nvalues and is more efficient than other continuation method and it can find all\nsolutions of equations without divergence just by changing auxiliary Homotopy\nfunction. Numerical example and simulation was done to solve the direct\nkinematic problem of the 3-UPU parallel manipulator that leads to 16 real\nsolutions. Results obviously reveal the fastness and effectiveness of this\nmethod than the conventional Homotopy continuation methods such as Newton\nHomotopy.

There are different approaches associated\nwith decentralized control strategy for coverage control problems. We perform a\ncomparative review of these approaches and use the approach based on simple\nlocal coordination rules. We investigate this extensively used nearest\nneighbour rule based approach for developing coverage control algorithms. In\nthis approach, a mobile robot gives an equal importance to every neighbour\nrobot coming under its communication range. We develop our control approach by\nmaking some of the mobile robots playing a more influential role than other\nmembers in the team. The approach based on this control strategy becomes\nefficient in terms of achieving a consensus on control inputs, say heading\nangle, velocity, etc. The decentralized control of mobile robots can also\nexhibit a cyclic behaviour under some physical constraints like a quantized\norientation of mobile robot. We further investigate the cyclic behaviour\nappearing due to the quantized control of mobile robots under some conditions.\nOur nearest neighbour rule based approach offers a biased strategy in case of\ncyclic behaviour appearing in the team of mobile robots. We consider a\nclustering technique inside the team of mobile robots. Our decentralized\ncontrol strategy calculates the similarity measure among the neighbours of a\nmobile robot. The team of mobile robots with the similarity measure based\napproach becomes efficient in achieving a fast consensus like on heading angle\nor velocity. We perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of our developed\napproach.

In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to\nmaneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only\nselect from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions, they are unable\nto utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the\nrobot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion\ntend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a\nplanning method, called the \"Randomized Possibility Graph\", which uses\nhigh-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the\n\"possibility\" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be\nutilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in\na variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context,\n\"semi-unstructured\" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are\narbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped\nover or maneuvered around using whole body motions."

    "summary": "Locomotion for legged robots poses considerable challenges when confronted by\nobstacles and adverse environments. Footstep planners are typically only\ndesigned for one mode of locomotion, but traversing unfavorable environments\nmay require several forms of locomotion to be sequenced together, such as\nwalking, crawling, and jumping. Multi-modal motion planners can be used to\naddress some of these problems, but existing implementations tend to be\ntime-consuming and are limited to quasi-static actions. This paper presents a\nmotion planning method to traverse complex environments using multiple\ncategories of continuous actions. To this end, this paper formulates and\nexploits the Possibility Graph---which uses high-level approximations of\nconstraint manifolds to rapidly explore the \"possibility\" of actions---to\nutilize lower-level single-action motion planners more effectively. We show\nthat the Possibility Graph can quickly find routes through several different\nchallenging environments which require various combinations of actions in order\nto traverse."

    "summary": "Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve robustness in\ngaits. However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step\nlocation and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,\nstep location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current\nstate of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the\nfirst stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a\npreviewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the\nstart of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step\nduration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the\nbest landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In\nthis stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset\nbetween the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion\n(DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the\nswing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each\ncontrol cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different\nscenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed\napproach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed."

This paper analyses the\nonline learning of robot manipulation tasks with Bayesian non-parametric\nmixture models under small variance asymptotics. The analysis yields a scalable\nonline sequence clustering (SOSC) algorithm that is non-parametric in the\nnumber of clusters and the subspace dimension of each cluster. SOSC groups the\nnew datapoint in its low dimensional subspace by online inference in a\nnon-parametric mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA)\nbased on Dirichlet process, and captures the state transition and state\nduration information online in a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) based on\nhierarchical Dirichlet process. A task-parameterized formulation of our\napproach autonomously adapts the model to changing environmental situations\nduring manipulation. We apply the algorithm in a teleoperation setting to\nrecognize the intention of the operator and remotely adjust the movement of the\nrobot using the learned model. The generative model is used to synthesize both\ntime-independent and time-dependent behaviours by relying on the principles of\nshared and autonomous control.

    "summary": "Human-robot handovers are characterized by high uncertainty and poor\nstructure of the problem that make them difficult tasks. While machine learning\nmethods have shown promising results, their application to problems with large\nstate dimensionality, such as in the case of humanoid robots, is still limited.\nAdditionally, by using these methods and during the interaction with the human\noperator, no guarantees can be obtained on the correct interpretation of\nspatial constraints (e.g., from social rules). In this paper, we present Policy\nImprovement with Spatio-Temporal Affordance Maps -- $\\pi$-STAM, a novel\niterative algorithm to learn spatial affordances and generate robot behaviors.\nOur goal consists in generating a policy that adapts to the unknown action\nsemantics by using affordances. In this way, while learning to perform a\nhuman-robot handover task, we can (1) efficiently generate good policies with\nfew training episodes, and (2) easily encode action semantics and, if\navailable, enforce prior knowledge in it. We experimentally validate our\napproach both in simulation and on a real NAO robot whose task consists in\ntaking an object from the hands of a human. The obtained results show that our\nalgorithm obtains a good policy while reducing the computational load and time\nduration of the learning process."

    "summary": "We propose a new probabilistic framework that allows mobile robots to\nautonomously learn deep generative models of their environments that span\nmultiple levels of abstraction. Unlike traditional approaches that attempt to\nintegrate separately engineered components for low-level features, geometry,\nand semantic representations, our approach leverages recent advances in\nsum-product networks (SPNs) and deep learning to learn a unified deep model of\na robot's spatial environment, from low-level representations to semantic\ninterpretations. Our results, based on laser range finder data from a mobile\nrobot, demonstrate that the proposed approach can learn the geometry of places\nand is a versatile platform for solving tasks ranging from semantic\nclassification of places, uncertainty estimation and novelty detection to\ngeneration of place appearances based on semantic information and prediction of\nmissing data in partial observations."

The contribution is that rigorous mathematical\nproofs of these properties are presented, most of which cannot be found in\nexisting literatures. We first give some properties regarding switch points and\naccelerating/decelerating curves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when\nkinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only\nconsiders torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we\ngive the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof.\nAccordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a run-and-test manner.\nSome simulation results on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those\npresented properties.

The\ndetailed proofs make the theory of NI more complete and help interested readers\nto gain a thorough understanding of the method."

    "summary": "Visual attention is the cognitive process that allows humans to parse a large\namount of sensory data by selecting relevant information and filtering out\nirrelevant stimuli. This papers develops a computational framework for visual\nattention in robots. We consider a Visual Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in\nwhich a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an\ninertial sensor. The robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to time\nand energy constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under\nlimited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the\nperformance of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key features.\nFirst, it is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by\na metric quantifying the task performance. Second, it exploits the notion of\nanticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot\ndynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a time horizon.\nThird, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a greedy\nalgorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it\nprovides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that\nthe greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection.\nSimulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads\nto dramatic improvements in the VIN performance. In the easy scenarios, our\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of localization errors. In\nthe most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate visual-inertial navigation\nwhile the state of the art fails to track robot's motion during aggressive\nmaneuvers."

    "summary": "With the advancement of robotics, machine learning, and machine perception,\nincreasingly more robots will enter human environments to assist with daily\ntasks. However, dynamically-changing human environments requires reactive\nmotion plans. Reactivity can be accomplished through replanning, e.g.\nmodel-predictive control, or through a reactive feedback policy that modifies\non-going behavior in response to sensory events. In this paper, we investigate\nhow to use machine learning to add reactivity to a previously learned nominal\nskilled behavior. We approach this by learning a reactive modification term for\nmovement plans represented by nonlinear differential equations. In particular,\nwe use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to represent a skill and a neural\nnetwork to learn a reactive policy from human demonstrations. We use the well\nexplored domain of obstacle avoidance for robot manipulation as a test bed. Our\napproach demonstrates how a neural network can be combined with physical\ninsights to ensure robust behavior across different obstacle settings and\nmovement durations. Evaluations on an anthropomorphic robotic system\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our work."

Robotic\nmanipulators are performing very well in structured workspaces, but do not\nadapt well to unexpected changes, like people entering the workspace. We\npresent a method combining 3D Camera based workspace mapping, and a predictive\nand reflexive robot manipulator trajectory estimation to allow more efficient\nand safer operation in dynamic workspaces. In experiments on a real UR5 robot\nour method has proven to provide shorter and smoother trajectories compared to\na reactive trajectory planner in the same conditions. Furthermore, the robot\nhas successfully avoided any contact by initialising the reflexive movement\neven when an obstacle got unexpectedly close to the robot.

Many researchers\nutilize computer vision techniques to extract the parameters automatically\nwhich lead to fine but not very stable results because of the complexity of the\nenvironment. We propose a method that utilizes an RGBD sensor and a GUI for\nusers to 'point' at the target region with a mouse to acquire 3D information.\nAlgorithms that can extract important parameters from the selected points are\ndesigned. To avoid large internal force induced by the misalignment of the\nrobot orientation and the normal of the door plane, we design a module that can\ncompute the normal of the plane by pointing at three non-collinear points and\nthen drive the robot to the desired orientation.

We present\ntechniques that optimize the graph for the L1-norm metric function commonly\nused in joint-based robotic planning, purposefully choosing a $t$-stretch\nfactor based on the geometry of the space, and removing redundant edges that do\nnot contribute to the graph quality. A high-quality pre-processed sparse\nroadmap is then available for re-use across many different planning scenarios\nusing standard repair and re-plan methods. Pre-computing the roadmap offline\nresults in more deterministic solutions, reduces the memory requirements by\naffording complex rejection criteria, and increases the speed of planning in\nhigh-dimensional spaces allowing more complex problems to be solved such as\nmulti-modal task planning. Our method is validated through simulated benchmarks\nagainst the SPARS2 algorithm. The source code is freely available online as an\nopen source extension to OMPL."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of computing shortest paths in a dense\nmotion-planning roadmap $\\mathcal{G}$. We assume that~$n$, the number of\nvertices of $\\mathcal{G}$, is very large. Thus, using any path-planning\nalgorithm that directly searches $\\mathcal{G}$, running in $O(V\\textrm{log}V +\nE) \\approx O(n^2)$ time, becomes unacceptably expensive. We are therefore\ninterested in anytime search to obtain successively shorter feasible paths and\nconverge to the shortest path in $\\mathcal{G}$. Our key insight is to provide\nexisting path-planning algorithms with a sequence of increasingly dense\nsubgraphs of $\\mathcal{G}$. We study the space of all ($r$-disk) subgraphs of\n$\\mathcal{G}$. We then formulate and present two densification strategies for\ntraversing this space which exhibit complementary properties with respect to\nproblem difficulty. This inspires a third, hybrid strategy which has favourable\nproperties regardless of problem difficulty. This general approach is then\ndemonstrated and analyzed using the specific case where a low-dispersion\ndeterministic sequence is used to generate the samples used for $\\mathcal{G}$.\nFinally we empirically evaluate the performance of our strategies for random\nscenarios in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and on manipulation planning\nproblems for a 7 DOF robot arm, and validate our analysis."

    "summary": "Personal indoor localization is usually accomplished by fusing information\nfrom various sensors. A common choice is to use the WiFi adapter that provides\ninformation about Access Points that can be found in the vicinity.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches to WiFi-based localization often\nemploy very dense maps of the WiFi signal distribution, and require a\ntime-consuming process of parameter selection. On the other hand, camera images\nare commonly used for visual place recognition, detecting whenever the user\nobserves a scene similar to the one already recorded in a database. Visual\nplace recognition algorithms can work with sparse databases of recorded scenes\nand are in general simple to parametrize. Therefore, we propose a WiFi-based\nglobal localization method employing the structure of the well-known FAB-MAP\nvisual place recognition algorithm. Similarly to FAB-MAP our method uses\nChow-Liu trees to estimate a joint probability distribution of re-observation\nof a place given a set of features extracted at places visited so far. However,\nwe are the first who apply this idea to recorded WiFi scans instead of visual\nwords. The new method is evaluated on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset used in the\nEvAAL competition, allowing fair comparison with other solutions."

The robot is\ncapable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea\nin active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to\nmeasurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's\nposition. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of\nthe (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a\nclosed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the\ntarget's position to an optimal control law for the robot.\n  Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target\ntracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting\ngreedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of\nthe state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of\nthe posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the\nstructural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders\nof magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality\nguarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing\nthe optimality guarantees. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through\nsimulations."

Such an evolution of the limbs' motion results in the swimmer's\nbase link to evolve in a 3 dimensional space. This swimmer's configuration\nspace admits a trivial principal fiber bundle structure, which along with the\nslender body theory at the low Reynolds number regime, facilitates obtaining a\nkinematic form of the equations. A coordinate-free expression for the local\nform of the kinematic connection is then derived, followed by a local\nparametrization for simulation purpose.

To perform this action, we\nneed to pass the end of the rope through an area that is enclosed by another\nsegment of rope. As for all knotting actions, the robot must for this exercise\ncontrol over a semi-compliant and flexible body whose complex 3d shape is\ndifficult to perceive and follow. Additionally, the target loop often deforms\nduring the insertion. We address this problem by defining a virtual magnetic\nfield through the loop's interior and use the Biot Savart law to guide the\nrobotic manipulator that holds the end of the rope. This approach directly\ndefines, for any manipulator position, a motion vector that results in a path\nthat passes through the loop. The motion vector is directly derived from the\nposition of the loop and changes as soon as it moves or deforms. In simulation,\nwe test the insertion action against dynamic loop deformation of different\nintensity.

    "summary": "In various interaction tasks using Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems\n(UVMSs) (e.g. sampling of the sea organisms, underwater welding), important\nfactors such as: i) uncertainties and complexity of UVMS dynamic model ii)\nexternal disturbances (e.g. sea currents and waves) iii) imperfection and\nnoises of measuring sensors iv) steady state performance as well as v) inferior\novershoot of interaction force error, should be addressed during the force\ncontrol design. Motivated by the above factors, this paper presents a\nmodel-free control protocol for force controlling of an Underwater Vehicle\nManipulator System which is in contact with a compliant environment, without\nincorporating any knowledge of the UVMS's dynamic model, exogenous disturbances\nand sensor's noise model. Moreover, the transient and steady state response as\nwell as reduction of overshooting force error are solely determined by certain\ndesigner-specified performance functions and are fully decoupled by the UVMS's\ndynamic model, the control gain selection, as well as the initial conditions.\nFinally, a simulation study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its\nefficiency."

Hybridness and underactuation are\nkey characteristics of these systems that complicate the design of feedback\ncontrollers. In this research, we examine and test a novel feedback controller\ndesign on a planar pushing system, where the purpose is to control the motion\nof a sliding object on a flat surface using a point robotic pusher. The\npusher-slider is a simple dynamical system that retains many of the challenges\nthat are typical of robotic manipulation tasks.\n  Our results show that a model predictive control approach used in tandem with\ninteger programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic\nconstraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature of\nthe contact. In order to achieve real-time control, simplifications are\nproposed to speed up the integer program. The concept of Family of Modes (FOM)\nis introduced to solve an online convex optimization problem by selecting a set\nof contact mode schedules that spans a large set of dynamic behaviors that can\noccur during the prediction horizon. The controller design is applied to\nstabilize the motion of a sliding object about a nominal trajectory, and to\nre-plan its trajectory in real-time to follow a moving target. We validate the\ncontroller design through numerical simulations and experimental results on an\nindustrial ABB IRB 120 robotic arm."

    "summary": "Scissor lifts, a staple of mechanical design, especially in competitive\nrobotics, are a type of linkage that can be used to raise a load to some\nheight, when acted upon by some force, usually exerted by an actuator. The\nposition of this actuator, however, can affect the mechanical advantage and\nvelocity ratio of the system. Hence, there needs to be a concrete way to\nanalytically compare different actuator positions. However, all current\nresearch into the analysis of scissor lifts either focusses only on the screw\njack configuration, or derives separate force expressions for different\nactuator positions. This, once again, leaves the decision between different\nactuator positions to trial and error, since the expression to test the potency\nof the position can only be derived once the position is chosen. This paper\nproposes a derivation for a general force expression, in terms of a few\ncarefully chosen position variables, which can be used to generate the force\nexpression for any actuator position. Hence, this expression illustrates\nexactly how each of the position variables (called a, b and i in this paper, as\ndefined later) affect the force output, and hence can be used to pick an\nappropriate actuator position, by choosing values for the position variables\nthat give the desired result."

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel filter with low computational demand to address\nthe problem of orientation estimation of a robotic platform. This is\nconventionally addressed by extended Kalman filtering of measurements from a\nsensor suit which mainly includes accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a digital\ncompass. Low cost robotic platforms demand simpler and computationally more\nefficient methods to address this filtering problem. Hence nonlinear observers\nwith constant gains have emerged to assume this role. The nonlinear\ncomplementary filter is a popular choice in this domain which does not require\ncovariance matrix propagation and associated computational overhead in its\nfiltering algorithm. However, the gain tuning procedure of the complementary\nfilter is not optimal, where it is often hand picked by trial and error. This\nprocess is counter intuitive to system noise based tuning capability offered by\na stochastic filter like the Kalman filter. This paper proposes the right\ninvariant formulation of the complementary filter, which preserves Kalman like\nsystem noise based gain tuning capability for the filter. The resulting filter\nexhibits efficient operation in elementary embedded hardware, intuitive system\nnoise based gain tuning capability and accurate attitude estimation. The\nperformance of the filter is validated using numerical simulations and by\nexperimentally implementing the filter on an ARDrone 2.0 micro aerial vehicle\nplatform."

    "summary": "We address one of the main challenges towards autonomous quadrotor flight in\ncomplex environments, which is flight through narrow gaps. While previous works\nrelied on off-board localization systems or on accurate prior knowledge of the\ngap position and orientation, we rely solely on onboard sensing and computing\nand estimate the full state by fusing gap detection from a single onboard\ncamera with an IMU. This problem is challenging for two reasons: (i) the\nquadrotor pose uncertainty with respect to the gap increases quadratically with\nthe distance from the gap; (ii) the quadrotor has to actively control its\norientation towards the gap to enable state estimation (i.e., active vision).\nWe solve this problem by generating a trajectory that considers geometric,\ndynamic, and perception constraints: during the approach maneuver, the\nquadrotor always faces the gap to allow state estimation, while respecting the\nvehicle dynamics; during the traverse through the gap, the distance of the\nquadrotor to the edges of the gap is maximized. Furthermore, we replan the\ntrajectory during its execution to cope with the varying uncertainty of the\nstate estimate. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approach\nin many real experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat addresses and achieves autonomous, aggressive flight through narrow gaps\nusing only onboard sensing and computing and without prior knowledge of the\npose of the gap."

    "summary": "This paper describes a computational model, called the Dirichlet process\nGaussian mixture model with latent joints (DPGMM-LJ), that can find latent tree\nstructure embedded in data distribution in an unsupervised manner. By combining\nDPGMM-LJ and a pre-existing body map formation method, we propose a method that\nenables an agent having multi-link body structure to discover its kinematic\nstructure, i.e., body schema, from tactile information alone. The DPGMM-LJ is a\nprobabilistic model based on Bayesian nonparametrics and an extension of\nDirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). In a simulation experiment,\nwe used a simple fetus model that had five body parts and performed structured\nrandom movements in a womb-like environment. It was shown that the method could\nestimate the number of body parts and kinematic structures without any\npre-existing knowledge in many cases. Another experiment showed that the degree\nof motor coordination in random movements affects the result of body schema\nformation strongly. It is confirmed that the accuracy rate for body schema\nestimation had the highest value 84.6% when the ratio of motor coordination was\n0.9 in our setting. These results suggest that kinematic structure can be\nestimated from tactile information obtained by a fetus moving randomly in a\nwomb without any visual information even though its accuracy was not so high.\nThey also suggest that a certain degree of motor coordination in random\nmovements and the sufficient dimension of state space that represents the body\nmap are important to estimate body schema correctly."

    "summary": "Magnetometer and inertial sensors are widely used for orientation estimation.\nMagnetometer usage is often troublesome, as it is prone to be interfered by\nonboard or ambient magnetic disturbance. The onboard soft-iron material\ndistorts not only the magnetic field, but the magnetometer sensor frame\ncoordinate and the cross-sensor misalignment relative to inertial sensors. It\nis desirable to conveniently put magnetic and inertial sensors information in a\ncommon frame. Existing methods either split the problem into successive\nintrinsic and cross-sensor calibrations, or rely on stationary accelerometer\nmeasurements which is infeasible in dynamic conditions. This paper formulates\nthe magnetometer calibration and alignment to inertial sensors as a state\nestimation problem, and collectively solves the magnetometer intrinsic and\ncross-sensor calibrations, as well as the gyroscope bias estimation. Sufficient\nconditions are derived for the problem to be globally observable, even when no\naccelerometer information is used at all. An extended Kalman filter is designed\nto implement the state estimation and comprehensive test data results show the\nsuperior performance of the proposed approach.

    "summary": "We consider an autonomous navigation problem, whereby a traveler aims at\ntraversing an environment in which an adversary tries to set an ambush. A two\nplayers zero sum game is introduced. Players' strategies are computed as random\npath distributions, a realization of which is the path chosen by the traveler.\nA parallel is drawn between the discrete problem, where the traveler moves on a\nnetwork, and the continuous problem, where the traveler moves in the plane.\nAnalytical optimal policies are derived. Using assumptions from the Minimal Cut\n- Maximal Flow literature, the optimal value of the game is shown to be related\nto the maximum flow on the environment in both the discrete and the continuous\ncases, when the reward function for the ambusher is uniform. A linear program\nis introduced that allows for the computation of optimal policies, compatible\nwith non-uniform reward functions. In order to relax the assumptions for the\ncomputation of the players' optimal strategies of the continuous game, a\nnetwork is created, inspired by recently introduced sampling based motion\nplanning techniques, and the linear program is adapted for continuous\nconstraints."

    "summary": "Autonomous delivery of goods using a MAV is a difficult problem, as it poses\nhigh demand on the MAV's control, perception and manipulation capabilities.\nThis problem is especially challenging if the exact shape, location and\nconfiguration of the objects are unknown. In this paper, we report our findings\nduring the development and evaluation of a fully integrated system that is\nenergy efficient and enables MAVs to pick up and deliver objects with partly\nferrous surface of varying shapes and weights. This is achieved by using a\nnovel combination of an electro-permanent magnetic gripper with a passively\ncompliant structure and integration with detection, control and servo\npositioning algorithms. The system's ability to grasp stationary and moving\nobjects was tested, as well as its ability to cope with different shapes of the\nobject and external disturbances. We show that such a system can be\nsuccessfully deployed in scenarios where an object with partly ferrous parts\nneeds to be gripped and placed in a predetermined location."

We call this problem the Team\nSurviving Orienteers (TSO) problem. The TSO problem is motivated by scenarios\nwhere a team of robots must traverse a dangerous, uncertain environment, such\nas aid delivery in disaster or war zones. We present the TSO problem formally\nalong with several variants, which represent \"survivability-aware\" counterparts\nfor a wide range of multi-robot coordination problems such as vehicle routing,\npatrolling, and informative path planning. We propose an approximate greedy\napproach for selecting paths, and prove that the value of its output is bounded\nwithin a factor $1-e^{-p_s/\\lambda}$ of the optimum where $p_s$ is the\nper-robot survival probability threshold, and $1/\\lambda \\le 1$ is the\napproximation factor of an oracle routine for the well-known orienteering\nproblem.

    "summary": "Attaining animal-like legged locomotion on rough outdoor terrain with sparse\nfoothold affordances -a primary use-case for legs vs other forms of locomotion-\nis a largely open problem. New advancements in control and perception have\nenabled bipeds to walk on flat and uneven indoor environments. But tasks that\nrequire reliable contact with unstructured world surfaces, for example walking\non natural rocky terrain, need new perception and control algorithms.\n  This thesis introduces 3D perception algorithms for contact tasks such as\nfoot placement in rough terrain environments. We introduce a new method to\nidentify and model potential contact areas between the robot's foot and a\nsurface using a set of bounded curved patches. We present a patch\nparameterization model and an algorithm to fit and perceptually validate\npatches to 3D point samples. Having defined the environment representation\nusing the patch model, we introduce a way to assemble patches into a spatial\nmap. This map represents a sparse set of local areas potentially appropriate\nfor contact between the robot and the surface. The process of creating such a\nmap includes sparse seed point sampling, neighborhood searching, as well as\npatch fitting and validation. Various ways of sampling are introduced including\na real time bio-inspired system for finding patches statistically similar to\nthose that humans select while traversing rocky trails. These sparse patch\nalgorithms are integrated with a dense volumetric fusion of range data from a\nmoving depth camera, maintaining a dynamic patch map of relevant contact\nsurfaces around a robot in real time. We integrate and test the algorithms as\npart of a real-time foothold perception system on a mini-biped robot,\nperforming foot placements on rocks."

    "summary": "Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization\nover the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a\nset of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated\nas a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to\nsolve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is\nable to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the\nspecial Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.\nThe crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as\nthe magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a\ncertain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is\npossible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of\nthe recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for\nsolving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,\ngeometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent\noptimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a\ntruncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.\nFinally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding\nprocedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a\nvariety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync\nis able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available\nmeasurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than\nthat typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and\ndoes so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based\napproach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques."

    "summary": "The three bio-inspired strategies that have been used for balance recovery of\nbiped robots are the ankle, hip and stepping Strategies. However, there are\nseveral cases for a biped robot where stepping is not possible, e. g. when the\navailable contact surfaces are limited. In this situation, the balance recovery\nby modulating the angular momentum of the upper body (Hip-strategy) or the Zero\nMoment Point (ZMP) (Ankle strategy) is essential. In this paper, a single Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) scheme is employed for controlling the Capture Point\n(CP) to a desired position by modulating both the ZMP and the Centroidal Moment\nPivot (CMP). The goal of the proposed controller is to control the CP,\nemploying the CMP when the CP is out of the support polygon, and/or the ZMP\nwhen the CP is inside the support polygon. The proposed algorithm is\nimplemented on an abstract model of the SURENA III humanoid robot.

Such non-modular and specialized control\napproaches render the generalization of these controllers to new in-hand\nmanipulation tasks difficult. Clearly, a grip control approach that generalizes\nwell between several tasks would be preferable. We propose a modular approach\nwhere each finger is controlled by an independent tactile grip controller.\nUsing signals from the human-inspired biotac sensor, we can predict future slip\n- and prevent it by appropriate motor actions. This slip-preventing grip\ncontroller is first developed and trained during a single-finger stabilization\ntask. Subsequently, we show that several independent slip-preventing grip\ncontrollers can be employed together without any form of central communication.\nThe resulting approach works for two, three, four and five finger grip\nstabilization control. Such a modular grip control approach has the potential\nto generalize across a large variety of inhand manipulation tasks, including\ngrip change, finger gaiting, between-hands object transfer, and across multiple\nobjects."

    "summary": "Localization is a key requirement for mobile robot autonomy and human-robot\ninteraction. Vision-based localization is accurate and flexible, however, it\nincurs a high computational burden which limits its application on many\nresource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we address the problem of\nperforming real-time localization in large-scale 3D point cloud maps of\never-growing size. While most systems using multi-modal information reduce\nlocalization time by employing side-channel information in a coarse manner (eg.\nWiFi for a rough prior position estimate), we propose to inter-weave the map\nwith rich sensory data. This multi-modal approach achieves two key goals\nsimultaneously. First, it enables us to harness additional sensory data to\nlocalise against a map covering a vast area in real-time; and secondly, it also\nallows us to roughly localise devices which are not equipped with a camera. The\nkey to our approach is a localization policy based on a sequential Monte Carlo\nestimator. The localiser uses this policy to attempt point-matching only in\nnodes where it is likely to succeed, significantly increasing the efficiency of\nthe localization process. The proposed multi-modal localization system is\nevaluated extensively in a large museum building. The results show that our\nmulti-modal approach not only increases the localization accuracy but\nsignificantly reduces computational time."

There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems\nthat we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under\npose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map\ninference. We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with\nuncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the\nrobot's perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach\nallows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the\npossible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed\ntechniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy\nmapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into\naccount pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by\nmodeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the\nmap quality."

    "summary": "In many human-in-the-loop robotic applications such as robot-assisted surgery\nand remote teleoperation, predicting the intended motion of the human operator\nmay be useful for successful implementation of shared control, guidance virtual\nfixtures, and predictive control. Developing computational models of human\nmovements is a critical foundation for such motion prediction frameworks. With\nthis motivation, we present a computational framework for modeling reaching\nmovements in the presence of obstacles. We propose a stochastic optimal control\nframework that consists of probabilistic collision avoidance constraints and a\ncost function that trades-off between effort and end-state variance in the\npresence of a signal-dependent noise. First, we present a series of\nreformulations to convert the original non-linear and non-convex optimal\ncontrol into a parametric quadratic programming problem. We show that the\nparameters can be tuned to model various collision avoidance strategies,\nthereby capturing the quintessential variability associated with human motion.\nThen, we present a simulation study that demonstrates the complex interaction\nbetween avoidance strategies, control cost, and the probability of collision\navoidance. The proposed framework can benefit a variety of applications that\nrequire teleoperation in cluttered spaces, including robot-assisted surgery. In\naddition, it can also be viewed as a new optimizer which produces smooth and\nprobabilistically-safe trajectories under signal dependent noise."

    "summary": "With the increased application of model-based whole-body control methods in\nlegged robots, there has been an resurgence of interest in system\nidentification strategies and adaptive control. An important class of methods\nrelates to the identification of inertia parameters for rigid-body systems. For\neach link, these consist of the mass, first mass moment (related to center of\nmass location), and 3D rotational inertia tensor. The main contribution of this\npaper is to formulate physical-consistency constraints on these parameters as\nLinear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Matrix inequalities are found not in terms\nof moments of inertia, but in terms of statistical moments, suggesting a\nstatistical perspective on the mass distribution of a rigid body. Through this\nviewpoint, a rich set of new constraints can be formulated as LMIs that enforce\nproperties on the underlying mass distribution of each link. Overall, new\nconstraints have a simpler form, are more efficient to enforce in optimization,\nand are tighter than those used in the current literature. The methods are\nverified in system identification for a leg of the MIT Cheetah 3 robot.\nDetailed properties of transmission components are identified alongside link\ninertias, with parameter optimization carried out to guaranteed global\noptimality through semidefinite programming."

Feature-based and direct\nmethods are two mainstreams in Visual SLAM. Both methods minimize photometric\nor reprojection error by iterative solutions, which are always computationally\nexpensive. To overcome this problem, we propose a non-iterative approach to\nmatch point clouds directly. In particular, a new inertial-visual framework is\nproposed to reduce computational requirement in two steps. First, the attitude\nand heading reference system (AHRS) and axonometric projection are utilized to\ndecouple the 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) data, so that point clouds can be\nmatched in independent spaces respectively. Second, the matching process is\ncarried out in frequency domain by Fourier transformation, which reduces\ncomputational requirements dramatically and provides a closed-form\nnon-iterative solution. In this manner, the time complexity can be reduced to\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log{n})$ where $n$ is the number of matched points in each\nframe.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first non-iterative approach\nfor data association in Visual SLAM.

We present a game-theoretic model of human\npartial adaptation to the robot, where the human responds to the robot's\nactions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time,\ncapturing the evolution of their expectations of the robot's capabilities. The\nrobot can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that\nreveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the\ninformation that the human currently has.

Our work aims to improve the\nperformance of such a human-robot team: the robot tries to guide the human\ntowards an effective strategy, sometimes against the human's own preference,\nwhile still retaining his trust. We achieve this through a principled\nhuman-robot mutual adaptation formalism. We integrate a bounded-memory\nadaptation model of the human into a partially observable stochastic decision\nmodel, which enables the robot to adapt to an adaptable human. When the human\nis adaptable, the robot guides the human towards a good strategy, maybe unknown\nto the human in advance. When the human is stubborn and not adaptable, the\nrobot complies with the human's preference in order to retain their trust. In\nthe shared autonomy setting, unlike many other common human-robot collaboration\nsettings, only the robot actions can change the physical state of the world,\nand the human and robot goals are not fully observable. We address these\nchallenges and show in a human subject experiment that the proposed mutual\nadaptation formalism improves human-robot team performance, while retaining a\nhigh level of user trust in the robot, compared to the common approach of\nhaving the robot strictly following participants' preference."

We\npresent extensive experimental results on a hydraulic, torque controlled\nhumanoid performing balancing and stepping tasks. This feedback control\napproach captures the necessary synergies between the DoFs of the robot to\nguarantee good control performance. We show that for the considered tasks, it\nis only necessary to re-linearize the dynamics of the robot at different\ncontact configurations and that increasing the number of LQR controllers along\ndesired trajectories does not improve performance. Our result suggest that very\nsimple controllers can yield good performance competitive with current state of\nthe art, but more complex, optimization-based whole-body controllers.

    "summary": "Cloud Robotics is one of the emerging area of robotics. It has created a lot\nof attention due to its direct practical implications on Robotics. In Cloud\nRobotics, the concept of cloud computing is used to offload computational\nextensive jobs of the robots to the cloud. Apart from this, additional\nfunctionalities can also be offered on run to the robots on demand.\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the computational\nintensive algorithm in robotics used by robots for navigation and map building\nin an unknown environment. Several Cloud based frameworks are proposed\nspecifically to address the problem of SLAM, DAvinCi, Rapyuta and C2TAM are\nsome of those framework. In this paper, we presented a detailed review of all\nthese framework implementation for SLAM problem."
