    "publish": "1998-09-11T18:40:05Z", 
    "summary": "Technology designers often strive to design systems that are flexible enough\nto be used in a wide range of situations. Software engineers, in particular,\nare trained to seek general solutions to problems. General solutions can be\nused not only to address the problem at hand, but also to address a wide range\nof problems that the designers may not have even anticipated. Sometimes\ndesigners wish to provide general solutions, while encouraging certain uses of\ntheir technology and discouraging or precluding others. They may attempt to\ninfluence the use of technology by ``hard-wiring'' it so that it only can be\nused in certain ways, licensing it so that those who use it are legally\nobligated to use it in certain ways, issuing guidelines for how it should be\nused, or providing resources that make it easier to use the technology as the\ndesigners intended than to use it in any other way.\n  This paper examines several cases where designers have attempted to influence\nthe use of technology through one of these mechanisms. Such cases include key\nrecovery encryption, Pegasus Mail, Platform for Internet Content Selection\n(PICS) Guidelines, Java, Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)\nImplementation Guide, Apple's style guidelines, and Microsoft Foundation\nClasses. In some of these cases, the designers sought to influence the use of\ntechnology for competitive reasons or in order to promote standardization or\ninteroperability. However, in other cases designers were motivated by\npolicy-related goals such as protecting privacy or free speech. As new\ntechnologies are introduced with the express purpose of advancing\npolicy-related goals (for example, PICS and P3P), it is especially important to\nunderstand the roles designers might play in influencing the use of technology.",

    "publish": "1999-03-18T17:01:27Z", 
    "summary": "In this work the impact of the Internet culture on standard mainstream\nsocieties has been analyzed. After analytically establishing the fact that the\nNet can be viewed as a pan-societal superstructure which supports its own\ndistinct culture, an ethnographic analysis is provided to find out the key\naspects of this culture. The elements of this culture which have an empowering\nimpacts on the standard mainstream societies, as well as the elements in it\nwhich can cause discouraging social effects are then discussed by a global\ninvestigation of the present status of various fundamental aspects (e,g,\neducation, economics, politics, entertainment etc) of the mainstream societies\nas well as their links with the Net culture. Though immensely potential for\nproviding various prominent positive impacts, the key findings of this work\nindicate that misuse of Internet can create tremendous harm to the members of\nthe mainstream societies by generating a set of morally crippled people as well\nas a future generation completely void of principles and ethics. This\nstructured diagnostic approach to the social problems caused by the manhandling\nof Internet leads to a concrete effort of providing the measures that can be\ntaken to enhance or to overcome the supporting and limiting effects of the Net\nculture respectively with the intent to benefit our society and to protect the\nteratoidation of certain ethical values.",

    "summary": "The shift towards the use of electronic media in scholarly communication\nappears to be an inescapable imperative. However, these shifts are uneven, both\nwith respect to field and with respect to the form of communication. Different\nscientific fields have developed and use distinctly different communicative\nforums, both in the paper and electronic arenas, and these forums play\ndifferent communicative roles within the field. One common claim is that we are\nin the early stages of an electronic revolution, that it is only a matter of\ntime before other fields catch up with the early adopters, and that all fields\nconverge on a stable set of electronic forums. A social shaping of technology\n(SST) perspective helps us to identify important social forces centered around\ndisciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication that pull\nagainst convergence. This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and\ncommunicative heterogeneity are durable features of the scholarly landscape,\nand that we are likely to see field differences in the use of and meaning\nascribed to communications forums persist, even as overall use of electronic\ncommunications technologies both in science and in society as a whole\nincreases.",

    "summary": "This paper examines the effect of ownership concentration on product\nposition, product variety and readership in markets for daily newspapers. US\nantitrust policy presumes that mergers reduce the amount and diversity of\ncontent available to consumers. However, the effects of consolidation in\ndifferentiated product markets cannot be determined solely from theory. Because\nmulti-product firms internalize business stealing, mergers may encourage firms\nto reposition products, leading to more, not less, variety. Using data on\nreporter assignments from 1993-1999, results show that differentiation and\nvariety increase with concentration. Moreover, there is evidence that\nadditional variety increases readership, suggesting that concentration benefits\nconsumers.",

    "summary": "Recent trends reveal the search by companies for a legal hook to prevent the\nundesired and unauthorized copying of information posted on websites. In the\ncenter of this controversy are metasites, websites that display prices for a\nvariety of vendors. Metasites function by implementing shopbots, which extract\npricing data from other vendors' websites. Technological mechanisms have proved\nunsuccessful in blocking shopbots, and in response, websites have asserted a\nvariety of legal claims. Two recent cases, which rely on the troublesome\ntrespass to chattels doctrine, suggest that contract law may provide a less\ndemanding legal method of preventing the search of websites by data robots. If\nblocking collection of pricing data is as simple as posting an online contract,\nthe question arises whether this end result is desirable and legally viable.",

However, the results of research reported\nin this paper imply that voice traffic greatly exceeds data traffic when real\nusers are asked to estimate their usage of a wide variety of media. Media usage\nwas surveyed for students in New York City and in Los Angeles. Other than\nsignificant differences in radio listening, e-mails, and downloads, the usage\nwas quite similar. Telephone usage (wired and wireless) was nearly an hour per\nday. When converted to bits, the telephone traffic was much greater than the\ndata traffic over the Internet. This paper reports on the details of the two\nuser studies. The traffic implications of the results are estimated. The\nfinding that voice exceeds data will then be reconciled with the popular\nopposite conception.",

    "title": "The Effect of Native Language on Internet Usage", 
    "publish": "2001-09-06T17:39:22Z", 
    "summary": "Our goal is to distinguish between the following two hypotheses: (A) The\nInternet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause\nmore people to learn English as second language and thus solidify the role of\nEnglish as a global language. This outcome will prevail even though there are\nmore native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English\nspeakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the\nnative languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power)\nand will not promote English as a global language.\n  English's \"early lead\" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are\nnot native English speakers frequently access the large number of English\nlanguage web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing\nweb sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their\nsites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical\nquestion, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not\nEnglish use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English\nspeakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data\nset on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada\nprovides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the\ntwo official languages.\n  Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to\nInternet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are\nconsistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English as a\nglobal language.",

    "publish": "2001-09-11T03:22:25Z", 
    "summary": "The unique challenge presented by the Internet is that compliance with local\nlaws is rarely sufficient to assure a business that it has limited its exposure\nto legal risk. The paper identifies why the challenge of adequately accounting\nfor the legal risk arising from Internet jurisdiction has been aggravated in\nrecent years by the adoption of the Zippo legal framework, commonly referred to\nas the passive versus active test. The test provides parties with only limited\nguidance and often results in detrimental judicial decisions from a policy\nperspective. Given the inadequacies of the Zippo passive versus active test,\nthe paper argues that it is now fitting to identify a more effective standard\nfor determining when it is appropriate to assert jurisdiction in cases\ninvolving predominantly Internet-based contacts. The solution submitted in the\npaper is to move toward a targeting-based analysis. Unlike the Zippo approach,\na targeting analysis would seek to identify the intentions of the parties and\nto assess the steps taken to either enter or avoid a particular jurisdiction.\nTargeting would also lessen the reliance on effects-based analysis, the source\nof considerable uncertainty since Internet-based activity can ordinarily be\nsaid to create some effects in most jurisdictions. To identify the appropriate\ncriteria for a targeting test, the paper recommends returning to the core\njurisdictional principle -- foreseeability. Foreseeability in the targeting\ncontext depends on three factors -- contracts, technology, and actual or\nimplied knowledge.",

Two recent\ndevelopments have important implications with respect to \"convergence,\"\nspectrum property rights and flexible use of the spectrum. The first\ndevelopment involves several proposals to provide terrestrial wireless services\nwithin spectrum in use or planned to be used to provide satellite services. The\nsecond development is the passage of the 2000 ORBIT Act which specifically\nforbids the use of license auctions to select among mutually exclusive\napplicants to provide international or global satellite communications service.\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the questions raised by these\ntwo events, but not necessarily to provide definitive answers or solutions.",

    "publish": "2001-09-17T22:01:01Z", 
    "summary": "The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical name space that\nenables the assignment of unique, mnemonic identifiers to Internet hosts and\nthe consistent mapping of these names to IP addresses. The root of the domain\nname system is the top of the hierarchy and is currently managed by a\nquasi-private centralized regulatory authority, the Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This paper identifies and discusses the\neconomic and policy issues raised by competing DNS roots. The paper provides a\nprecise definition of root-competition and shows that multiple roots are a\nspecies of standards competition, in which network externalities play a major\nrole. The paper performs a structural analysis of the different forms that\ncompeting DNS roots can take and their effects on end-user compatibility. It\nthen explores the policy implications of the various forms of competition.\n  The thesis of the paper is that root competition is caused by a severe\ndisjunction between the demand for and supply of top-level domain names. ICANN\nhas authorized a tiny number of new top-level domains (7) and subjected their\noperators to excruciatingly slow and expensive contractual negotiations. The\ngrowth of alternate DNS roots is an attempt to bypass that bottleneck. The\npaper arrives at the policy conclusion that competition among DNS roots should\nbe permitted and is a healthy outlet for inefficiency or abuses of power by the\ndominant root administrator.",

    "summary": "Drawing on perspectives from telecommunications policy and neo-Gramscian\nunderstandings of international political economy, this paper offers an\nexplanation and analysis of the shifting patterns of regulation which have been\nevident in the telecommunications sector in recent years. It aims to illustrate\nexplain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty\naway from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations\nin the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.\n  Our central argument is that telecommunications governance has evolved from a\nregulatory arena characterised, in large part, by national diversity, to one\nwherein a more convergent global multilayered system is emerging. We suggest\nthat the epicentre of this regulatory system is the relatively new World Trade\nOrganisation (WTO). Working in concert with the WTO are existing\nwell-established nodes regulation. In further complement, we see regional\nregulatory projects, notably the European Union (EU), as important conduits and\nnodes of regulation in the consolidation of a global regulatory regime.\n  By way of procedure, we first explore the utility of a neo-Gramscian approach\nfor understanding the development of global regulatory frameworks. Second, we\nsurvey something of the recent history - and, in extension, conventional wisdom\n- of telecommunications regulation at national and regional levels. Third, we\ndemonstrate how a multilayered system of global telecommunications regulation\nhas emerged centred around the regulatory authority of the WTO.

    "publish": "2001-09-19T13:50:38Z", 
    "summary": "A dichotomy in regulatory treatment and corporate cultures exists between\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication carriers. Telephone\ncompany executives (Bell Heads) may resent regulation, but they accept their\nfate and work creatively to exploit anomalies and opportunities to secure a\nregulation-conferred competitive advantage. Most ISP executives (Net Heads)\nappear to embrace a libertarian attitude, strongly opposing any government\ninvolvement. Despite the clash of cultures, the telecommunications and Internet\nworlds have merged. Such convergence jeopardizes the ability of Net Heads to\navoid some degree of regulation, particularly when they offer services\nfunctionally equivalent to what their Bell Head counterparts offer.\n  This paper will assess the regulatory consequences when telecommunication and\nInternet services converge in the marketplace and in terms of operating\ntechnologies. The paper identifies commercial developments in the Internet to\nsupport the view that the Internet has become more hierarchical and more like\ntelecommunication networks. The paper concludes that telecommunication carriers\nwill display superior skill in working the regulatory process to their\nadvantage. The paper suggests that Bell Heads will outmaneuver Net Heads\nparticularly when the revenue siphoning effect of Internet-mediated services\noffsets the revenues generated from ISP leases of telecommunication\ntransmission capacity.",

However, the\nrelationship between concentration and price varies according to the type of\nlong distance plan considered. For the international flagship plans frequently\nselected by more price-conscious consumers of international long distance,\nincreased competition on a route is associated with lower prices. In contrast,\nfor the basic international plans that are the default selection for consumers,\nincreased competition on a route is actually associated with higher prices.\nThus, somewhat surprisingly, price dispersion appears to increase as\ncompetition increases.",

This paper discusses\nthe difficulties of satisfying these joint constraints given the legacy of the\ncommon law doctrines of \"just price\" and \"businesses affected with a public\ninterest.\" In this regard, it is helpful to view traditional public utility\nregulation as a form of welfare state regulation, as it suffers from similar\npolitical problems from policy retrenchment.

    "summary": "While traditional radio stations are subject to extensive government\nregulations, Internet radio stations remain largely unregulated. As Internet\nradio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these\nInternet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming\nto American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio\nstation ownership may be further relaxed.\n  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to\nprotect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio\nbroadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it\nshould be considered as relevant by regulators.\n  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to\nfive criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to\nlisteners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,\nlocation and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible\nto draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans\nwith diverse broadcasting options.\n  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding\nmeasurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters\nare providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,\nowners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies\naiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce\nthese findings.",

    "summary": "In asserting a competitive market environment as a justification for\nregulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated\na clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most\nprotean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,\ninhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public\nand regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way\nin which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant\nto communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses\ninterpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes\nthat the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information\nservice providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships\nand behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity\nfor untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the\nsocial phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and\ncommons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in\npolicy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.",

    "summary": "Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in\nthe direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government\nofficials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California\ninitiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital\nsignatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other\nballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will\nsignificantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the\ninfluence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it\nwill increase both public participation in the political process and public\nunderstanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether\nInternet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the\nmeasure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.\nBeyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the\neffects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage\ngreater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or\nwould it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current\nproblems with the initiative process itself?

I identify five economic characteristics of\nInternet technology that should lead to these greater efficiencies: (1) lower\ndelivery costs and reduced capacity constraints, (2) more efficient\ninteractivity, (3) more efficient advertising and sponsorship, (4) more\nefficient direct pricing and bundling, and (5) lower costs of copying and\nsharing.\n  The most successful Internet TV business models are likely to involve\nsyndication to or from other media, and also international distribution. In the\nbroader context, Internet TV is another syndication outlet by which program\nsuppliers can segment their overall markets and thus support higher production\ninvestments. Many innovative and more sharply focused programs will surely\nprosper on Internet TV, but the attractiveness to audiences of high production\nvalue programming will tend to advantage broad appeal programming, such as\nHollywood movies. Historical evidence about the performance of cable television\nand videocassettes is presented to support these points.",

    "summary": "This paper develops a theoretical perspective on globalization and the\nInformation Society and combines it with a critical usage of international\nregime theory as a heuristic for understanding the current historical period of\ntransition from an international telecommunicaitons regime (Cowhey, 1990; 1994)\nto a new and complex regime aimed at providing governance for the Global\nInformation Infrastructure and Global Information Society (GII/GIS). In\nanalyzing the principles, values, norms, rules, collective decision-making\nprdocedures, and enforcement mechanisms of the emergent GII/GIS regime, this\npaper differentiates between three regime levels: (1) Macro-Regime--global; (2)\nMezzo-Regime--regional and sub-regional; and (3) Micro-Regime--national. The\npaper employs a case-study approach to explore some of the specific national\nresponses (i.e. South Africa) to this regime transition, with an analysis of\npotential best practices and lessons learned for other emerging economies. Key\nfindings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic,\nand technological factors are eroding the existing international\ntelecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate\nrestructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new\nregime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is\nbeing driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by\nthe more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related\nto global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at\nnational, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition\nin both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative\nresponse, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.",

However,\nthere is little evidence yet either of consumers' valuation of their privacy or\nof the benefits they might reap through better target marketing. We provide a\nframework for measuring a portion of the benefits from allowing marketers to\nmake better use of consumer information.

    "summary": "E-Commerce challenges traditional approaches to assessing monopolistic\npractices due to the rapid rate of growth, rapid change in technology,\ndifficulty in assessing market share for information products like web sites,\nand high degree of interconnectivity and alliance formation among corporations.\nThis paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and\neconomic perspective to the search engine market.\n  The findings indicate that (1) despite an increasing number of search\nengines, barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential growth in\nthe number of web sites and the non-scalability of the current search\ntechnology and collective switching costs; (2) older search engine sites tend\ntypically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic\nindicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by\nanticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in\nthis paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern.\n  Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other\npossible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some\nsearch engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The\ntrend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We\nsuggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and\ninvestigate \"information search cost\" as a performance indicator of search\ntechniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive\nconduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer\nwelfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the\nsearch engine market is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce.",

This historical case study of the period between Sputnik and the\ncreation of the ARPANET shows how military, scientific, and academic values\nshaped the institutions and relations of a foundational period in the creation\nof the Internet.\n  The paper probes three areas: the ideology of the science policy consensus,\nthe institutional philosophy of IPTO under J.

By examining the intellectual, cultural, and\ninstitutional details of the consensus that governed IPTO research between 1957\nand 1969, we can understand the ways that these values defined the range of\npossibilities for network computing.\n  The influence of the social values expressed by these actors was decisive:\nthat government had an obligation to support a broad base of scientific\nresearch to promote both the public good and the national defense; that\nIPTO-sponsored computing research would accomplish both military and scientific\nobjectives; and that IPTO could leverage its power within this consensus to\ncreate a network to share resources and unite researchers over geographical\ndistance.

    "publish": "2001-09-24T07:15:36Z", 
    "summary": "Do switching costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where\nfirms charge the same price to old and new consumers? Theoretically, the answer\ncould be either \"yes\" or \"no,\" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing\ndecisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers\nwho are \"locked-in\" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher\nfuture profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon\ntheoretical model.\n  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer\nthis question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change\nservice providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who\ngenerally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new\ndatabase made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and\nregulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers\nprovide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.\n  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&T\nadjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.\nPreliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&T\nreduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to\nthose that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the\nswitching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. These\nresults suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this\ntime period, AT&T's incentive to charge a higher price to \"locked-in\" consumers\nexceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era\nof non-portability.",

Characterizing the nature of available content using Media\nMetrix web page visits by about 13,500 households, we document that\nsubstantially more online local content is available in larger markets.\nCombining this with CPS Internet use data, we find statistically significant\ndirect evidence of both complementarity and substitutability: Individuals are\nmore likely to connect in markets with more local online content; and holding\nlocal online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. We\nalso find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: Blacks are more\nlikely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of\nlocal population, making the Internet is a substitute for agglomeration of\npreference minorities within cities, if not cities themselves.

The\nregulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the\nFederal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required\n(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and\naffordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical\nsimilarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed\nInternet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in\nthe near future. Regulatory disincentives to build such networks are present,\ndriven in part by market realities and in part by competitive restrictions in\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. Finally, we pose the question of whether a\nfederal effort equivalent to the R.E.A. is needed to ensure that residents of\nsparsely populated areas, like their predecessors in the 1930s, are not\ncomparatively disadvantaged in the first decades of the 21st century. The paper\nconcludes with a proposal to accelerate the deployment of broadband\ninfrastructure in rural America.",

We\nfirst provide an overview of auction models for allocating resources. We then\nexamine the experience of auctioning spectrum in different countries. Based on\nthis examination, we posit some axioms that seem to have to be satisfied when\nallocating spectrum in most developing countries. In light of these axioms, we\nprovide a critical evaluation of using Vickrey second- price auctions to\nallocate spectrum in developing countries. We suggest the use of a new auction\nmechanism, the Vickrey \"share auction\" which will satisfy many of these axioms.",

    "publish": "2001-09-24T15:42:08Z", 
    "summary": "There have been a small number of cost studies of Voice over IP (VoIP) in the\nacademic literature. Generally, they have been for abstract networks, have not\nbeen focused on the public switched telephone network, or they have not\nincluded the operating costs. This paper presents the operating cost portion of\nour ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs\nfor an existing local exchange carrier.\n  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit\nswitching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a\ntelco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,\nwhich will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution\nscenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost\ndifferences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%\nof the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences\nfor substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial\nperformance would be small. But IP has some hidden benefits on the operations\nside. Most notably, data and voice services could be managed with the same\nsystems infrastructure, meaning that the incremental operations cost of rolling\nout new services would likely be much lower, since it would all be IP.",

    "summary": "The debate on the Information Society shows large agreement on the assumption\nthat the promised benefits will fully display only if the diffusion of ICTs and\nthe Internet will involve all the actors of the socio-economic system.\nAccordingly, special emphasis is put on the participation of small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs), but also on public administrations (PAs) as promoters and\ncatalysts of private initiatives. As for SMEs, public intervention concerns\nboth the promotion of fully competitive e-markets and the solution of market\nfailures. However, effective and efficient intervention requires specific\ninformation on SMEs' approach to e-commerce, often depending upon specific\nsector and local condition and in most cases still lacking. In order to\nidentify the need and the scope for public intervention, the paper focuses on a\npeculiar SMEs-intensive productive environment: the manufacturing industrial\ndistrict, which traditionally constitutes an examples of winning SMEs' network,\ncharacterised by common industrial culture and intense input-output\ninteractions. The paper presents empirical evidence from the Italian districts\nof Como (textile industry) and Lumezzane (metalwork industry). The research\nresults show that pro-active entrepreneurs are creatively exploring the\nopportunities offered by the Internet to promote their businesses. However, it\nis also clear that the transition to the Internet economy still involves a\nreduced percentage of potential participants, and that institutional actions\nare needed in order to foster a larger participation.",

    "summary": "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private\nnon-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as\nthe de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made\navailable to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs\nfor sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of\nICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its\npotential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those\nwho transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the\ngovernment as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this\nis correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust\nimmunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain\ncompetition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate\nthat their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's\npreventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring\nthe UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as\nanticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject\nto the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated\nthe antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether\nthe DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under\nprecedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private\nICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved\nin the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal\nliability. ICANN should act very differently with respect to both the UDRP and\nthe competitive roots if it is to avoid restraining trade.",

I\nalso suggest reasons to think that peer-production can have systematic\nadvantages over both property-based markets and corporate managerial\nhierarchies as a method of organizing information and cultural production in a\nnetworked environment, because it is a better mechanism for clearing\ninformation about human capital available to work on existing information\ninputs to produce new outputs, and because it permits largers sets of agents to\nuse larger sets of resources where there are increasing returns to the scale of\nboth the set of agents and the set of resources available for work on projects.\nAs capital costs and communications costs decrease in importance as factors of\ninformation production, the relative advantage of peer production in clearing\nhuman capital becomes more salient.",

    "publish": "2001-09-24T20:11:23Z", 
    "summary": "Information technology is redefining national security and the use of force\nby state and nonstate actors. The use of force over the Internet warrants\nanalysis given recent terrorist attacks. At the same time that information\ntechnology empowers states and their commercial enterprises, information\ntechnology makes infrastructures supported by computer systems increasingly\naccessible, interdependent, and more vulnerable to malicious attack. The\nComputer Security Institute and the FBI jointly estimate that financial losses\nattributed to malicious attack amounted to $378 million in 2000. International\nLaw clearly permits a state to respond in self-defense when attacked by another\nstate through the Internet, however, such attacks may not always rise to the\nscope, duration, and intensity threshold of an armed attack that may justify a\nuse of force in self-defense.\n  This paper presents a policy framework to analyze the rules of engagement for\nInternet attacks. We describe the state of Internet security, incentives for\nasymmetric warfare, and the development of international law for conflict\nmanagement and armed conflict. We focus on options for future rules of\nengagement specific to Information Warfare.\n  We conclude with four policy recommendations for Internet attack rules of\nengagement: (1) the U.S. should pursue international definitions of \"force\" and\n\"armed attack\" in the Information Warfare context; (2) the U.S. should pursue\ninternational cooperation for the joint investigation and prosecution of\nInternet attacks; (3) the U.S. must balance offensive opportunities against\ndefensive vulnerabilities; and (4) the U.S. should prepare strategic plans now\nrather than making policy decisions in real-time during an Internet attack.",

    "summary": "This exploratory and descriptive research compares the policy-making\nprocesses and policy recommendations regarding universal service and universal\naccess developed by the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory\nCouncil (NIIAC) and the Canadian Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in\nconjunction with related federal government agencies. Created in 1993 and 1994,\nrespectively, the Councils were charged with \"bringing forward\" the concepts of\nuniversal service and universal access to adjust to the effects of\nderegulation, new and converged Information and Communication Technologies\n(ICTs), and neo-liberal economic competition and globalization that included\nacknowledging the private sector as the primary creator of the Information\nHighway.This qualitative study used as its methodology organizational, policy,\nnarrative, and discourse analyses to create a picture of what universal service\nand universal access were and what they became in the hands of NIIAC, IHAC. The\nU.S. had started with a more clearly defined universal service tradition than\nCanada, and undertook a more complex policy-making process with more\nexperienced personnel. It was also clear that IHAC had in many ways followed\nthe U.S. model and arrived at many similar recommendations as NIIAC. Because of\nthe inevitability of technical, economic, and social change related to the\nInformation Highway, no definitive outcome to the Universal Service and\nUniversal Access \"story\" can be determined. Because the Canadian government did\nnot follow up on some of IHAC's most crucial recommendations, the Canadian\nInformation Highway \"story,\" in particular, has been left less complete than\nthat of the U.S.",

In response there are calls in\nCongress and even from the FCC for new legislation to \"free the Bells.\"\nHowever, the same ideology drove policy, not just five years ago, but also\nalmost twenty years back with the first modern push for \"freedom,\" namely\ndivestiture.\n  How might we frame the question of policy for local access to engender a more\nfruitful approach? The starting point for this analysis is the network--not\nbits and bytes, but the human network. With the human network as starting\npoint, the unit of analysis is the community--specifically, the individual in a\ntension with community. There are two core ideas.\n  The first takes a behavioral approach to the economics--and the relative\nshare between beneficial chaos and order, in economic affairs, becomes\nexplicit.\n  If the first main idea provides a conceptual base for open source, the second\ncore idea distinguishes open source from open design, ie at the information\n'frontier' we push forward.\n  The resulting policy frame for access is worked out in the detailed, concrete\nsteps of an extended thought experiment. A small town setting (Concord,\nMassachusetts) grounds the discussion in the real world. The purpose overall is\nto stimulate new thinking which may break out of the conundrum where periodic\nrounds to legislate 'freedom' produce the opposite, recursively.

    "summary": "In this piece, we take up the case of the domain name system as an example of\nchallenges and solutions for realspace sovereigns in cyberspace. First, we\nanalyze the 'in rem' provision of the US Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection\nAct (ACPA), which purports to expand the scope of the ACPA to encompass\ndisputes with little direct connection with the United States. In reality,\nthere exist no cases of foreign cybersquatting as to which the 'in rem'\nprovision will be both applicable and constitutional. Instead the ACPA 'in rem'\nprovision is notable primarily for its aggressive assertion of jurisdiction,\nleading us to consider the (often overlooked) role of realspace sovereigns in\nthe regulation of the domain names system. By mapping the logical control over\nthe domain names system-the distributed hierarchy that is the basis of the\nsystem's design-onto realspace territory, the potential for sovereign\nregulation of the system becomes apparent. We argue that the regulatory\nsignificance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present\nterritorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies\nthe future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic\ndecrease in its value. Accordingly, we argue that realspace sovereigns (and\nespecially the United States) have strong interests in avoiding segmentation,\nand thus must seek to coordinate the regulation of the system.",

    "summary": "This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects\nof Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws\non findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall\n2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that\nearly adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities\nand to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.\nFurther, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their\ncommunity involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four\nsites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in\npolitical activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce\nthose of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic\nminded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial\napplications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four\nsites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,\n2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other\nstudies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,\namong others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument\nthat increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily\nto the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.\nAs later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement\nor civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet\naccess may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic\nengagement in geographic communities.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we aim to empirically examine the value of website usage and\nsellers' listing behavior in the two leading Internet auctions sites, eBay and\nYahoo!Auctions. The descriptive data analysis of the seller's equilibrium\nlisting behavior indicates that a seller's higher expected auction revenue from\neBay is correlated with a lager number of potential bidders measured by website\nusage per listing. Our estimation results, based on the logarithm\nspecifications of sellers' expected auction revenues and potential bidders'\nwebsite usage, show that in a median case, (i) 1 percent increase of the unique\nvisitors (page views) per listed item induces 0.022 (0.007) percent increase of\na seller's expected auction revenue; and (ii) 1 percent increase of sellers'\nlistings induces 1.99 (4.74) percent increase of the unique visitors (page\nviews). Since increased expected auction revenues will induce more listings, we\ncan infer positive feedback effects between the number of listings and website\nusage. Consequently, Yahoo!Auctions, which has substantially less listings, has\ngreater incentives to increase listings via these feedback effects which are\nreflected in its fee schedules.",

    "title": "Is the Commercial Mass Media Necessary, or Even Desirable, for Liberal   Democracy?", 
    "publish": "2001-09-24T22:09:18Z", 
    "summary": "Is a commercial mass media, dependent on the market for its sustenance,\nnecessary, or even desirable, for liberal democracy? Yochai Benkler has argued\nthat a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of communications and information is\nboth possible with digital technology and preferable to a system based on\ncommercial mass media. He has contended in fact that the presence of\npolitically powerful, copyright-rich mass media imposes significant barriers to\nthe development of peer-to-peer information-sharing networks. In contrast, I\nhave argued that the commercial mass media play an important, and perhaps even\nvital, role in liberal democracy by galvanizing public opinion, serving as a\nwatchdog against government and corporate wrongdoing, agenda-setting (which\nenables public discourse), and serving as a relatively trustworthy source of\ninformation. This paper seeks to push the ball forward on this issue. It first\nisolates and enumerates the contributions that the commercial mass media are\nsaid to make towards liberal democracy. It then briefly assesses the extent to\nwhich the commercial mass media actually fulfills these constitutive functions.\nIt then asks whether alternative institutions might serve some or all of these\nfunctions just as well or better. In so doing, it looks both to the past and\nthe future. First, it examines the political party-supported press that thrived\nin the United States through much of the 19th century. Second, it examines\ngovernment-funded mass media. Third, it looks, skeptically, at possibilities\nfor peer-to-peer sharing of information and opinion in the digital network\nenvironment. I conclude that, despite the weaknesses of commercial mass media,\nan information policy suitable to liberal democracy should include a plurality\nof types of voices, including commercial mass media.",

    "publish": "2001-09-24T22:21:00Z", 
    "summary": "In 1999, the FCC authorized direct access to INTELSAT, allowing INTELSAT's\nU.S. customers and competitors to bypass INTELSAT's U.S. retail affiliate\n(COMSAT), and to take satellite capacity at wholesale prices directly from\nINTELSAT. This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling\nrequirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)\nunder the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic\ncable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open\naccess to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide\nresidential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable\nfacilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic\ncable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring direct access to\nINTELSAT.\n  For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system\noperators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the\nmultichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition\nin the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In\ncontrast, it is clear that no analogous issues of tying were implicated by\nINTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications\nmarket was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product\nto tie to its established offerings. Similarly, while it may be debated whether\nor not a cable plant is a bottleneck facility that gatekeeps broadband Internet\nfor many residential users, it is beyond cavil that INTELSAT in 1999 controlled\nvirtually no such bottleneck facilities.",

    "publish": "2001-09-24T22:37:33Z", 
    "summary": "A major goal of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to promote competition\nin both the local exchange and long distance wireline markets. In section 271\nCongress permitted the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the long\ndistance market only if they demonstrate to the FCC that they have complied\nwith the market-opening requirements of section 251. This paper examines the\nlogic behind section 271, to determine if it is a reasonable means of achieving\nincreased competition in both the local and long distance markets, given the\ntechnical characteristics of the industry and the legal and informational\nconstraints on regulators who must ensure compliance. It also provides an\nupdate on the extent of competitive entry in the local exchange market five\nyears after enactment of the Act.\n  In this paper we examine a variety of schemes for ensuring BOC compliance\nthat Congress could have used. Given the characteristics of the industry and\nthe limitations on regulators' ability to observe BOC's efforts, we determine\nthat the use of a prize such as BOC entry into long distance is a superior\nincentive mechanism. We further determine that conditioning a BOC's long\ndistance entry on its demonstrating compliance with section 251 is a logical\nmethod of protecting the long distance market against a BOC discriminating\nagainst long distance competitors once it has gained entry. The statistical\nevidence we look at, using data we have collected on ILEC lines sold to CLECs\nfor POTS services, appears to confirm that section 271 has thus far been\neffective in ensuring compliance.",

Pundits such as Rheingold (1993) have argued that the Internet\nwill provide citizens with a way to bypass traditional media and gain\nunmediated access to each parties political message as well as providing a\nforum for citizens to engage the parties, and each other in deliberative\ndebate.\n  Through a longitudinal analysis of party web pages and telephone interviews\nwith party staffers, we analyze the role the Internet played in the election\ncampaigns of Canada's federal parties. Our findings indicate that the parties\nare still focusing on providing online features that talk at the voter instead\nof engaging them in any type of meaningful discourse. Most of these sites were\nexceptionally similar in their structure and in the type of content they\nprovided. Generally, these sites served as digital archives for campaign\nmaterial created with other media in mind and despite the multimedia\ncapabilities of the Internet, these sites tended to be overwhelmingly text\noriented. In line with Stromer-Galley's (2000) discussion of why candidates in\nthe U.S. avoid online interaction, we also argue that little incentive exists\nto motivate parties to engage in any meaningful interaction with voters online.",

    "publish": "2001-09-24T23:38:42Z", 
    "summary": "As privacy issues have gained social salience, entrepreneurs have begun to\noffer privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and the U.S. has begun to enact\nprivacy legislation.\n  But \"privacy\" is an ambiguous notion. In the liberal tradition, it is an\nindividualistic value protecting citizens from intrusion into a realm of\nautonomy. A feminist critique suggests that the social utility of privacy is to\nexclude certain issues from the public realm. Sociologists suggest that privacy\nis about identity management, while political economists suggest that the most\nsalient privacy issue is the use of personal information to normalize and\nrationalize populations according to the needs of capital.\n  While PETs have been developed for use by individual consumers, recently\ndevelopers are focusing on the business to business market, where demand is\nstoked by the existence of new privacy regulations. These new laws tend to\noperationalize privacy in terms of \"personally identifiable information.\" The\nnew generation of PETs reflect and reify that definition. This, in turn, has\nimplications for the everyday understandings of privacy and the constitution of\nidentity and social life.\n  In particular, this socio-technical practice may strengthen the ability of\ndata holders to rationalize populations and create self-serving social\ncategories. At the same time, they may permit individuals to negotiate these\ncategories outside of panoptic vision. They may also encourage public\ndiscussion and awareness of these created social categories.",

In implementing proposals to expand the\nname space, ICANN adopted an approach far different from Jon Postel's\nlightweight proposals. ICANN staff, in setting the ground rules for considering\nnew gTLDs, emphasized that only a few applicants would be allowed in, and\nimposed strict threshold requirements. Staff determined that the Board should\npick TLDs by looking at all relevant aspects of every proposal, and deciding\nwhich ones presented the best overall combination of a variety of\nincommensurable factors. Aspects of the resulting process were predictable:\nAnyone familiar with the FCC comparative hearing process for broadcast licenses\ncan attest that this sort of ad hoc comparison is necessarily subjective,\nlending itself to arbitrariness and biased application. Yet the process had\nadvantages that appealed to ICANN decision-makers. The Board members would be\nfree to take their best shots, in a situationally sensitive manner, at\nadvancing the policies they thought important. The approach allowed ICANN to\nmaintain the greatest degree of control. The end result, though, was a process\nstunning in its arbitrariness, a bad parody of fact-bound, situationally\nsensitive (rather than rules-based) decision-making.",

    "summary": "When decisions about developing standards are left to individual firms, there\nare many advantages including a flexible response to market evolution,\naccommodation to rapid technology change, and avoidance of costly coordination.\nHowever, the market process does not necessarily lead to compatible standards,\nespecially when there is no clear market dominator. Standards Institutions\ngenerally facilitate better communication among market participants, which may\ndiscourage early and/or primitive incompatible standards to emerge in the\nmarket. However, expenditures on institutional standards-setting can lead to\ndiminishing returns, or even be counter-productive because institutional\nstandards usually take longer to produce and are slower to respond to\ntechnology development. Government agencies can specify compulsory standards to\navoid incompatibility. In addition, governments can tie their policy on\nstandardization closely with their industrial, trade, and/or regulatory\npolicies. However, many exogenous factors handicap a government's effective\ninvolvement. Government often fails to respond to the dynamics of technology\ndevelopment and consumer demand, and to pick up the \"right technology\".

We discuss three potential transmission channels by which license fees\ncan influence the price and quantity of service sold in a wireless market: an\nincrease in average cost, an increase in incremental costs, and impacts of sunk\ncosts on the emerging market structure.\n  From this conceptual debate, an empirical model is developed and tested using\ncross-sectional data for the residential mobile voice market. We utilize a\nstructural equation approach, modeling the supply and demand relationships\nsubject to the constraint that supply equals demand. The results confirm the\nexistence of a positive effect of license fees on the cost of supply.

We illustrate how network\narchitecture can create impediments to open communications, and how QoS\nmonitoring can detect such effects. We present data from a field test of\nQoS-monitoring software now in development. We suggest QoS metrics to gauge\nwhether information \"walled gardens\" represent a real threat for dividing the\nInternet into proprietary spaces.\n  To demonstrate our proposal, we are placing our software on the computers of\na sample of broadband subscribers. The software periodically conducts a battery\nof tests that assess the quality of connections from the subscriber's computer\nto various content sites. Any systematic differences in connection quality\nbetween affiliated and non-affiliated content sites would warrant research into\nthe behavioral implications of those differences.\n  QoS monitoring is timely because the potential for the Internet to break into\na loose network of proprietary content domains appears stronger than ever.\nRecent court rulings and policy statements suggest a growing trend towards\nrelaxed scrutiny of mergers and the easing or elimination of content ownership\nrules. This policy environment could lead to a market with a small number of\nlarge, vertically integrated network operators, each pushing its proprietary\ncontent on subscribers.",

Such losses can result not only in mere\ninconvenience, but in serious corporate and national security breaches. Because\nof the potentially catastrophic nature of such security breaches, it behooves\ncellular network operators, distributors, and users to explore these network\nrisk areas and mitigate them to the extent that current resources allow.",

    "summary": "This focused study on state-level policy and access patterns contributes to a\nfuller understanding of how these invisible barriers work to structure access\nand define rural communities. Combining both quantitative and qualitative data,\nthis study examines the role of geo-policy barriers in one of the largest and\nmost rural states in the nation.\n  Expanded Area Service policies are state policies wherein phone customers can\nexpand their local calling area. Because useful Internet access requires a\nflat-price connection, EAS policies can play a crucial role in connecting\ncitizens to one another. EAS policies (including Texas') tend to vary along\nfive dimensions (community of interest, customer scope, directionality, pricing\nmechanism and policy scope). EAS policies that rely on regulated market\nboundaries for definition can generate gross inequities in rural Internet\naccess. Interviews with Internet Service Providers in a case study of 25 rural\ncommunities reveals that LATA and exchange boundaries, along with\ngeographically restricted infrastructure investments, curtail service provision\nin remote areas. A statistical analysis of 1300 telephone exchanges, including\n208 rural telephone exchanges in Texas reveals that the farther a community\nlies from a metropolitan area the less likely they are to have reliable\nInternet access",

    "publish": "2001-09-26T13:46:21Z", 
    "summary": "The ability to make international roaming calls is of increasing importance\nto customers in Europe. This contrasts with various complaints that retail\nprices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on\nwholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The\npaper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have\nimpaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the\ntwo leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new\nentrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues that a\nnumber of developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation\nin the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home\nmobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest\ncharges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800\noperators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear.\nGiven the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently\nprovide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for\npreferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it\nwill be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a\npan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for\npreferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in\ndownstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that\nlack the bargaining power. However, arbitrage by roaming brokers, new entry and\nwider geographical markets on the retail roaming level will work against this.",

The tension, which we had not seen explicitly addressed in\nany other work on computer security, emerged when we set out to extract from\nthe concept of security the set values that ought to guide the shape of\nweb-browser security. We found it impossible to construct an internally\nconsistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places\ncompeting -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking. We\nneeded to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one. One conception\nof computer security invokes the ordinary meaning of security. According to it,\ncomputer security should protect people -- computer users -- against dangers,\nharms, and threats. Clearly this ordinary conception of security is already\ninforming much of the work and rhetoric surrounding computer security. But\nanother, substantively richer conception, also defines the aims and trajectory\nof computer security -- computer security as an element of national security.\nAlthough, like the ordinary conception, this one is also concerned with\nprotection against threats, its primary subject is the state, not the\nindividual. The two conceptions suggest divergent system-specifications, not\nfor all mechanisms but a significant few.",

    "publish": "2006-06-20T12:22:15Z", 
    "summary": "Text-to-speech technology has been broadly used to help people with voice\ndisabilities to overcome their difficulties. With text-to-speech, a person\ntypes at a keyboard, the text is synthesized, and the sound comes out through\nthe computer speakers.\n  In recent years, Voice over IP (VoIP) applications have become very popular\nand have been used by people worldwide. These applications allow people to talk\nfor free over the Internet and also to make traditional calls through the\nPublic-Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) at a small fraction of the cost\noffered by traditional phone companies.\n  We have created a system, called EasyVoice, which integrates speech\nsynthesizers with VoIP applications. The result allows a person with motor\nimpairments and voice disabilities to talk with another person located anywhere\nin the world. The benefits in this case are much stronger than the ones\nobtained by non-disabled people using VoIP applications. People with motor\nimpairments sometimes can hardly use a regular or mobile phone. Thus, the\nadvantage is not only the reduction in cost, but more important, the ability to\ntalk at all.",

    "summary": "This paper is to obtain a simple dividing-diagram of the congressional\ndistricts, where the only limit is that each district should contain the same\npopulation if possibly. In order to solve this problem, we introduce three\ndifferent standards of the \"simple\" shape. The first standard is that the final\nshape of the congressional districts should be of a simplest figure and we\napply a modified \"shortest split line algorithm\" where the factor of the same\npopulation is considered only. The second standard is that the gerrymandering\nshould ensure the integrity of the current administrative area as the\nconvenience for management. Thus we combine the factor of the administrative\narea with the first standard, and generate an improved model resulting in the\nnew diagram in which the perimeters of the districts are along the boundaries\nof some current counties. Moreover, the gerrymandering should consider the\ngeographic features.The third standard is introduced to describe this\nsituation. Finally, it can be proved that the difference between the supporting\nratio of a certain party in each district and the average supporting ratio of\nthat particular party in the whole state obeys the Chi-square distribution\napproximately. Consequently, we can obtain an archetypal formula to check\nwhether the gerrymandering we propose is fair.",

We computed the number of stories users submitted, dugg or\ncommented on weekly. We report a spike in user activity in September 2006,\nfollowed by a gradual decline, which seems unaffected by the elimination of\nuser ranking. The spike can be explained by a controversy that broke out at the\nbeginning of September 2006.

Here we show how this\ntemporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We\nshow that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free,\nleading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals.\nWhile previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in\nscale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free\nconnectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition,\nwe show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of\nnon-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for\nsustaining time-expiring information through a network.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we report some on-going focused research, but are further keen\nto set it in the context of a proposed bigger picture, as follows. There is a\ncertain depressing pattern about the attitude of industry to spreadsheet error\nresearch and a certain pattern about conferences highlighting these issues. Is\nit not high time to move on from measuring spreadsheet errors to developing an\narmoury of disciplines and controls? In short, we propose the need to\nrigorously lay the foundations of a spreadsheet engineering discipline.\nClearly, multiple research teams would be required to tackle such a big task.\nThis suggests the need for both national and international collaborative\nresearch, since any given group can only address a small segment of the whole.\nThere are already a small number of examples of such on-going international\ncollaborative research. Having established the need for a directed research\neffort, the rest of the paper then attempts to act as an exemplar in\ndemonstrating and applying this focus. With regard to one such of research, in\na recent paper, Panko (2005) stated that: \"...group development and testing\nappear to be promising areas to pursue\".

This, coupled with the ever\nincreasing computation speed, storage capacity and data mining capabilities,\nled to the renewal of interest in automatic community detection methods.\nSurprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One\nfrequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or\nbetter-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut\nedges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].\nThis definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community\ndetection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher\nthan expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative\ndefinition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have\nmore influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We\npresent a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based\nmodularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into\ncommunities.

Methods - A cluster sample survey based on a\nself-administered questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270\nfamilies of patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in\nthe greater Paris area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition\nto usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the\nappreciation or rejection of the considered technologies.

Furthermore the distributions\nof almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations\nwere demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses\n(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick\nrecovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195).

Network analysis\nalgorithms usually project such networks unto simple graphs composed of\nentities of a single type. In the process, they conflate relations between\nentities of different types and loose important structural information. We\ndevelop a mathematical framework that can be used to compactly represent and\nanalyze heterogeneous networks that combine multiple entity and link types. We\ngeneralize Bonacich centrality, which measures connectivity between nodes by\nthe number of paths between them, to heterogeneous networks and use this\nmeasure to study network structure. Specifically, we extend the popular\nmodularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality\nmetric. We also rank nodes based on their connectivity to other nodes. One\nadvantage of this centrality metric is that it has a tunable parameter we can\nuse to set the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings change\nwith this parameter allows us to identify important nodes in the network. We\napply the proposed method to analyze the structure of several heterogeneous\nnetworks. We show that exploiting additional sources of evidence corresponding\nto links between, as well as among, different entity types yields new insights\ninto network structure.",

    "summary": "In computer science, students could benefit from more opportunities to learn\nimportant, high-level concepts and to improve their learning skills. Peer\nreview is one method to encourage this by providing students with the\nopportunity to evaluate other people's work and to receive feedback on their\nown projects. This allows for rich learning experience but it is not\nimmediately obvious how to create a programming project review that will\nimprove the students' conceptual understanding, require higher level thinking,\nand be engaging. The current literature does not typically address differences\nbetween review implementations or provide reasons for design decisions. This\nwork explored how two different types of reviews affected the students'\nlearning of concepts, high-level thinking, and engagement. There were\nindications that the type of review affected how well students addressed the\nconcept they were reviewing and the comments' length. This shows that the\nreview's type may affect student engagement and conceptual learning. There were\nalso differences in how they reviewed the concepts of Abstraction,\nDecomposition, and Encapsulation, suggesting that the concepts are being\nlearned in different ways. Both of these results have an impact on the use of\npeer review computer science but need further investigation.",

Therefore, the success\nof electronic commerce significantly depends on providing security and privacy\nfor its consumers sensitive personal data. Consumers lack of acceptance in\nelectronic commerce adoption today is not merely due to the concern on security\nand privacy of their personal data, but also lack of trust and reliability of\nWeb vendors. Consumers trust in online transactions is crucial for the\ncontinuous growth and development of electronic commerce. Since Business to\nConsumer (B2C) ecommerce requires the consumers to engage the technologies, the\nconsumers face a variety of security risks. This study addressed the role of\nsecurity, privacy and risk perceptions of consumers to shop online in order to\nestablish a consensus among them. The analyses provided descriptive frequencies\nfor the research variables and for each of the study s research constructs. In\naddition, the analyses were completed with factor analysis and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients. The findings suggested that perceived privacy of\nonline transaction on trust is mediated by perceived security, and consumers\ntrust in online transaction is significantly related with the trustworthiness\nof Web vendors. Also, consumers trust is negatively associated with perceived\nrisks in online transactions. However, there is no significant impact from\nperceived security and perceived privacy to trust in online transactions.",

    "summary": "Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in\nface-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better\nthe needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the\nspecific case of project management training. The results of a course\nobservation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools\ninvolves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore\ndissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of\nknowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a\npersonalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or tutor)\nwhich gives information to monitor activities and supports the acquisition and\ntransfer of expertise. This platform is meant for the complex educational\ncontext of project-based learning. Indeed, as for the majority of project-based\nlearning activities, the articulation conceptualisation-experiment is an\nimportant part of the process. The originality of our approach relies on also\nsupporting the articulation between action (experiment or conceptualisation)\nand reflection. This approach so improves the acquisition of complex skills\n(e.g. management, communication and collaboration), which requires a\nbehavioural evolution. We aim at making the students become able ?to learn to\nlearn' and evolve according to contexts. We facilitate their ability to have a\ncritical analysis of their actions according to the situations they encounter.",

    "summary": "Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast\nbrief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of\ncontacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the\nlaunch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing,\nand news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended\nuse, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author's mood\nstatus.

In this article, we perform a sentiment\nanalysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and\nDecember 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of\nmood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended\nversion of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a well-established psychometric\ninstrument. We compare our results to fluctuations recorded by stock market and\ncrude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as\nthe U.S. Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We\nfind that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have\na significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions\nof public mood.

Hence, this paper designed a 3D online\ncooperative learning system for operating virtual instruments with\ncircuit-measuring function. By integrating with Virtual Reality, Remote Control\nParameter Transmission and embedded system techniques, this system gives\nlearners not only a cooperative learning environment via networking to jointly\noperate the 3D virtual instruments (for example, multi-meters, power supplies\nand oscilloscopes) but also the functions of instant messages and 3D puzzles to\ninteract with one another.

    "summary": "The Personality and emotions are effective parameters in learning process.\nThus, virtual learning environments should pay attention to these parameters.\nIn this paper, a new e-learning model is designed and implemented according to\nthese parameters. The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses\ntwo agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA).\nDuring the learning process and depending on events happening in the\nenvironment, learner's emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style\nshould be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner's\ncurrent emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on\ntheir personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA\nin some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own\npersonality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real\nlearning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the\nlearner's personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values\nuses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show\nthat considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases\nlearning quality and satisfies the learner.",

E-Learning 2.0 emerges as an innovative method of\nonline learning for its incorporation of Web 2.0 tools. For any academic study,\nthe curriculum provides overview of intact learning area. The Curriculum\nprovides overview to content of the Subject. Many institutions place student\ninteraction as a priority of their online curriculum design. It is proved that\ninteraction has a great effect on the students' involvement in learning and\nacceptance of Curriculum. Students are accepting curriculum that is designed by\nteacher; whereas E-learning 2.0 enabled Curriculum management system allows\nstudent to involve in learning activities. It works as a stimulus and increases\ntheir dedication to the Curriculum. While Institute adapts E-Learning 2.0 as\nLearning Management System, it also provides Social Networking services and\nprovides direct and transparent interaction between students and teachers. This\nview of the e-Learning 2.0 shifts its focus from LMS to the students, equipping\nthem, with the means to become ever more autonomous, accepting them to make use\nof these means in solving problems on their own initiative.

    "summary": "Internet generation is growing accustomed to having broadband access wherever\nthey go and not just at home or in the office, which turns mobile broadband\ninto a reality. This paper aims to look for a suitable mobile broadband\nsolution in the South Asian region through comparative analysis in various\nperspectives. Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data\nrather than voice having IP networks based on OFDM technology. Proving\ncompetency in various significant aspects WiMAX and LTE already have made a\nstrong position in telecommunication industry. Again, because of certain\nsimilarities in technology; they aren't like technological rivals as of GSM and\nCDMA. But still they are treated as opponents and viewed as a major threat in\ncase of the flourishing of each other. Such view point is surely not conducive\nfor getting the best out of them. In this paper various aspects and\napplications of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. South Asia\nbeing the residence of an enormous number of people presents an exciting\nopportunity for mobile operators, developers and internet service providers.\nSo, every consideration that has been made here also correlates successfully\nwith south Asia i.e. how mass people of this region may be benefited from it.\nAs a result, it might be regarded as a good source in case of making major BWA\ndeployment decisions in this region. Besides these, it also opens the path for\nfurther research and thinking in this issue.",

    "summary": "Popularity of content in social media is unequally distributed, with some\nitems receiving a disproportionate share of attention from users. Predicting\nwhich newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for\nboth companies that host social media sites and their users. Accurate and\ntimely prediction would enable the companies to maximize revenue through\ndifferential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would\nalso give consumers an important tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of\ncontent. Predicting popularity of content in social media, however, is\nchallenging due to the complex interactions among content quality, how the\nsocial media site chooses to highlight content, and influence among users.\nWhile these factors make it difficult to predict popularity \\emph{a priori}, we\nshow that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites allows predicting\npopularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating\naspects of the web site design, such models improve on predictions based on\nsimply extrapolating from the early votes. We validate this claim on the social\nnews portal Digg using a previously-developed model of social voting based on\nthe Digg user interface.",

These\nprojects can address universal themes and develop well-being models that are\nvaluable across a diversity of societies and economies. It is a universal fact\nthat SMEs in all countries provide a substantial proportion of total\nemployment, and conduct much of a nation's innovative activity. Yet these\nsmaller companies struggle in global markets on a far from level playing field,\nwhere large companies have distinct advantages. To redress this imbalance the\nCommission saw it as a priority to improve the trading capability of the Small\nand Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and perceived digital platforms as the\nmodern means to this end. They considered that the best operational model for a\nvibrant Web2.0-based Internet services industry would be by analogy to\nwell-performing biological ecosystems. Open Source Software is adopted in the\nDBE/OPAALS projects as the best support for sustainability of such complex\nelectronic webs, since it minimises interoperability problems, enables code\naccess for cheaper in-house modification or development of systems, and reduces\nboth capital and operating expenditure.",

    "summary": "The research effort on mobile computing has focused mainly on routing and\nusually assumes that all mobile devices (MDs) are cooperative. These\nassumptions hold on military or search and rescue operations, where all hosts\nare from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application\nof mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but\nproliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the\nlimited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced\nin MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals,\nshare the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes\nvery low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in\nwired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs\nwill likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide\nbenefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution.\nFor our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward\nmessages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens\nthe entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may\nalso start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the\ncomplete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent\nmalicious attacks in MANET and analyzes recent selfish trends in MANET.

The Formaleuro (FEUR) as a dimension for monetary\nquantities is proposed as well as the Formalbitcoin (FBTC) which represents an\nitem ready for circulation in a model of informational money.\n  An attempt is made to understand the concept of money from scratch. In order\nto provide a definition of money the need is felt to make use of a tailored\ntheory of definition. To that end a theory of imaginative definitions is\npresented and its implications for definitions of money are sketched.\n  It is argued that a theory of money may be dependent on the role of its\nholder. A survey of some roles is given, with the so-called subordinate\nadministrative role (SAR) in a central position.\n  The concepts of virtual memory and virtual machine are taken as the point of\ndeparture for a definition of the notion of virtual money. It is argued that\nfrom the perspective of a component (division) of a large organization (ORG)\nits local financial system (LFS) provides a virtual money vm(LFS, ORG) which\nmay well fail to meet the most common general and acknowledged moneyness\ncriteria.

    "summary": "On the Internet large service providers tend to control the digital\nidentities of users. These defacto identity authorities wield significant power\nover users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access\nto services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks,\nmanipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the\nemerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise\ndecentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that\ncontrol their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in\nuser-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground\nfor decentralised identity provisioning. We show how social trust, rather than\nblind deference to authorities, can provide a basis for identity, where risks\ncan be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are\nconsidering the move from authority-centric centralised identity provisioning\nto user-centric distributed identity provisioning. Finally, we highlight the\npotential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information\nSociety and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption.",

    "summary": "Information and knowledge in exchange in public networks is a crucial\nchallenge that needs to be overcome in order to consolidate the benefits\nassociated with such structures. We study the impact of the nature of the\ninformation exchanged over the possibilities of success of this process, basing\nourselves on the analysis of the information produced by the members of the\nNetwork of National Educational Portals. One of the main challenges that the\nNetwork of National Educational Portals faces consists in finding effective\nways of sharing information that can promote knowledge transfer between members\nof the network. We argue that a key factor that prevents information sharing is\nthe use of performance metrics by portal responsibles to evaluate the results\nof their decisions. These metrics are highly sensitive, context-dependent, and\nproduced through non-standardized methods, all of which reduce the willingness\nof knowledge sharing. We present a different approach: based on the Network of\nNational Educational Portals case, we propose creating a comprehensive\ninformation system aimed at providing reliable and timely information in a\nsystematic fashion. We believe that adopting standardized procedures and\nindicators of less sensitive nature, we can produce information for all\npartners without the shortcomings of the usual practices.",

However, a mobile device is\nstill resource constrained, and some applications usually demand more resources\nthan a mobile device can a ord. To alleviate this, a mobile device should get\nresources from an external source. One of such sources is cloud computing\nplatforms. We can predict that the mobile area will take on a boom with the\nadvent of this new concept. The aim of this paper is to exchange messages\nbetween user and location service provider in mobile device accessing the cloud\nby minimizing cost, data storage and processing power. Our main goal is to\nprovide dynamic location-based service and increase the information retrieve\naccuracy especially on the limited mobile screen by accessing cloud\napplication.

Since radio frequencies are diminishing natural resources,\nthere seems to be a fundamental barrier to further capacity increase. The\nsolution can be found by using smart antenna systems. Smart or adaptive antenna\narrays consist of an array of antenna elements with signal processing\ncapability that optimizes the radiation and reception of a desired signal,\ndynamically. Smart antenna can place nulls in the direction of interferers via\nadapting adaptive updating of weights linked to each antenna element. They thus\ncancel out most of the cochannel interference resulting in better quality of\nreception and lower dropped calls. Smart antenna can also track the user within\na cell via direction of arrival algorithms.

    "summary": "Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in\nface-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better\nthe needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the\nspecific case of project management training. The results of a course\nobservation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools\ninvolves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore\ndissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of\nknowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a\npersonalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or\ntutor), which gives information to monitor activities and supports the\nacquisition and transfer of expertise. This platform is based on Knowledge\nManagement (KM) and Web 2.0 concepts to support the dynamic building of\nknowledge. KM is used to define the learning process (based on the experiential\nlearning theory) and the way the individual knowledge building is monitored\n(based on metacognitive concepts). Web 2.0 is used to define the way the\nexperience is shared. We make the hypothesis that this approach improves the\nacquisition of complex skills (e.g. management, communication and\ncollaboration), which requires a behavioural evolution. We aim at making the\nstudents become able 'to learn to learn' and evolve according to contexts. We\nfacilitate their ability to have a critical analysis of their actions according\nto the situations they encounter.",

Control increasingly\nrests with centralized service providers who, as a consequence, have also\namassed unprecedented amounts of data about the behaviors and personalities of\nindividuals.\n  Developers, regulators, and consumer advocates have looked to alternative\ndecentralized architectures as the natural response to threats posed by these\ncentralized services. The result has been a great variety of solutions that\ninclude personal data stores (PDS), infomediaries, Vendor Relationship\nManagement (VRM) systems, and federated and distributed social networks. And\nyet, for all these efforts, decentralized personal data architectures have seen\nlittle adoption.\n  This position paper attempts to account for these failures, challenging the\naccepted wisdom in the web community on the feasibility and desirability of\nthese approaches. We start with a historical discussion of the development of\nvarious categories of decentralized personal data architectures. Then we survey\nthe main ideas to illustrate the common themes among these efforts. We tease\napart the design characteristics of these systems from the social values that\nthey (are intended to) promote. We use this understanding to point out numerous\ndrawbacks of the decentralization paradigm, some inherent and others\nincidental.

    "summary": "This paper intends to introduce a game-based 3D Virtual Learning Environment\n(VLE) to second graders. The impetus arose from the need to make learning in\nmathematics more effective and interesting through multimedia. Applied in a\ngame, the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division are expected to performed by learners as they\nrepresent themselves as avatars while they immerse in a quest of digital\nobjects in the VLE called Math World. Educational attributes such as mentality\nchange, emotional fulfillment, knowledge enhancement, thinking skills\ndevelopment, and bodily coordination are evaluated to ensure learning\neffectiveness. Also, game playability measured in terms of game plays, story,\nmechanics and interface usability are examined for its educative design. With\nan aggregate of these enhanced indices, results attest that objectives were met\nwhile making mathematics an interesting, motivating and enjoyable subject,\nhence VLE a significant tool to complement the conventional approaches of\nteaching.",

There are\nstrong desires to provide online users more dedicated and personalized services\nthat fit into individual's need, usually strongly depending on the inner\npersonalities of the user. However, little has been done to conduct proper\npsychological analysis, crucial for explaining the user's outer behaviors from\ntheir inner personality. In this paper, we propose an approach that intends to\nfacilitate this line of research by directly predicting the so called Big-Five\nPersonality from user's SNS behaviors. Comparing to the conventional\ninventory-based psychological analysis, we demonstrate via experimental studies\nthat users' personalities can be predicted with reasonable precision based on\ntheir online behaviors. Except for proving some former behavior-personality\ncorrelation results, our experiments show that extraversion is positively\nrelated to one's status republishing proportion and neuroticism is positively\nrelated to the proportion of one's angry blogs (blogs making people angry).",

The EML also reduces the workload of college\nlaboratories. Students have their own individual EML at their disposal anytime,\nwhich can be used to design hobby projects as a fun too. This will make them\nskilled engineers. This provides tremendous benefits in teaching learning\nprocess. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and teachers.\nIncorporating active/ cooperative learning into traditional instruction can be\na useful pedagogical tool to help students to perform practicals and project\nwork any time anywhere.

This is due firstly to both the complexity and the size of\ne-government systems and secondly to the importance of the issues. However,\npermitting easy and personalized access to e-government services has become, at\nthis juncture, an arduous and not spontaneous process. Indeed, the provided\ne-gov services to the user represent a critical contact point between\nadministrations and users. The encountered problems in the e-gov services\nretrieving process are: the absence of an integrated one-stop government, the\ndifficulty of localizing the services' sources, the lack of mastery of search\nterms and the deficiency of multilingualism of the online services. In order to\nsolve these problems, to facilitate access to e-gov services and to satisfy the\nneeds of potential users, we propose an original approach to this issue. This\napproach incorporates a semantic layer as a crucial element in the retrieving\nprocess. It consists in implementing a personalized search system that\nintegrates ontology of the e-gov domain in this process.",

    "summary": "With the advance of industrial mass production, modern micro-electronics and\ncomputers, the intervals between the release of new generations of consumer\nproducts have been dramatically reduced and so have their lifetime cycles.\nWhile it was very natural in the post-war era, that sophisticated consumer\nproducts like television sets and stereo equipment would not be replaced with a\nnew product until they break, and usually beyond that point since it was very\ncommon to have a broken television set serviced, the habits of consumers have\nchanged during the last quarter of the 20th century.\n  A modern consumer product, like Apple's famous iPhone has a market life of\napproximately one year until a successor is announced and subsequently pushed\ninto the market. Usually these new generations bring a bunch of new features,\nhave a higher performance while maintaining the price or becoming even cheaper,\nthus the consumer greatly benefits from the reduced lifetime cycle of these\nproducts.\n  However, electronic devices not only require a lot of of Earth's limited\nresources for their production, but their production processes are a major\nsource for harmful climate gases like carbon dioxide and toxic waste like heavy\nmetal alloys, acids and alkalis. And last but not least is every obsoleted\niPhone a candidate for waste facilities unless consumers are going to sell them\non the second hand market.\n  While we can not expect consumers and manufacturers to go back to the early\ndays of consumer products where lifetime cycles reached up to 20 years, the\nworld record being the famous \"Centennial Lightbulb\" in Livermore, CA in the\nUS, which has been lit for over 100 years, it is certainly about time to\nrethink modern consumerism with regard to responsibility to future generations.",

It is capable of both hermetic detection\nthat scrutinizes only local collections of documents (other students' texts and\nlecture materials, for example) and web plagiarism detection, in which the aim\nis at identifying instances of plagiarism that have been sourced from the\nInternet. The main feature of the system is the sampling-based web plagiarism\ndetection, a novel approach to plagiarism detection that is based on combining\nweb and hermetic search technologies. The system uses standard web search\nengines to locate documents on the Internet that might have been used as\nsources of plagiarism by the writer of a text. During this sampling phase, the\nsuspected sources are downloaded, converted to ASCII text and saved to the\nlocal database so that they can be later processed by using the hermetic\ndetection methods. We evaluated the system by using a test set that contained\ninstances of verbatim copying as well as texts in which plagiarism was\nconcealed by minor editing, replacing words with synonyms and by paraphrasing.\nWe compared the results achieved by AntiPlag to an earlier evaluation study of\nfour web plagiarism detection systems, SafeAssignment, TurnitIn, EVE2 and\nPlagiarism-Finder.

    "summary": "Information systems have always been in a prime focus in organizations in\nboth local (Pakistani) and global environment. Now the race of being the best\nthrough Information Systems has created its importance in public sector\norganizations to meet the global challenges. Public sector organizations have\nbeen facing problems in different segments of technology adoption especially in\nERP projects. ERP adoption/implementation projects in public sector\norganizations still encounter major setbacks in terms of partly/completely\nsuccess/failure. Cultural and other social barriers have been resistant in\ntechnology adoption in Pakistan. Now in the case of big ERP adoptions the\ncontextual factors must be identified and addressed. The paper investigates the\nreasons of success or failure by addressing nature of complexities regarding\ndifferent contextual factors. The study includes a sample of Pakistan s four\npublic sector organizations. The sample of this four organizations includes two\norganizations (Type-A) i.e. Oil & Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and\nNational Database Registration Authority (NADRA) where ERP has been\nsuccessfully implemented and other two (Type-B) i.e. Pakistan Telecommunication\nCorporation Limited (PTCL), Higher Education Commission (HEC) where ERP\nimplementation is in progress. The findings address the contextual factors i.e.\ncultural, environmental & political changes which have a variable impact on ERP\nsystems adoption/implementation in addition to Business Process Re-engineering\n(BPR). Paper also briefly includes analysis of gaps between pre & post ERP\nimplementation scenarios.",

However, the factors that make technology\nconstruct in a virtual R&D team are still ambiguous. The manager of virtual R&D\nteams for new product development does not know which type of technology should\nbe used. Approach: To address the gap and answer the question, the study\npresents a set of factors that make a technology construct. The proposed\nconstruct modified by finding of the field survey (N = 240). We empirically\nexamine the relationship between construct and its factors by employing the\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM). A measurement model built base on the 19\npreliminary factors that extracted from literature review. The result shows 10\nfactors out of 19 factors maintaining to make technology construct. Results:\nThese 10 technology factors can be grouped into two constructs namely Web base\ncommunication and Web base data sharing. The findings can help new product\ndevelopment managers of enterprises to concentrate in the main factors for\nleading an effective virtual R&D team.

Even though countries differ in the numerical criterion for\ndefining the old age, the UN has agreed that the cutoff of 60+ years refers to\nthe older population. When the percentage of older population increases in a\ncountry, the country faces new challenges in the form of economical as well as\nsocial impacts. The economic impacts are felt in the form of a shortfall in\nlabor supply, income, household savings while an increase in the payment of\nretirement benefits and healthcare expenditures. On the social side, the\nelderly population feels continuously isolated due to the changes in the value\nsystem. The United Nations has identified five quality of life characteristics\nfor the elderly in its 1991 resolution named the United Nations Principles for\nOlder Persons. In this paper the authors initially look at the trends in the\nincrease of aged population in Asia in general and Sri Lanka in particular.\nThen they discuss how the quality of life characteristics can be achieved in a\ncost effective way through the use of Information and Communication Technology\n(ICT). The authors take an in depth look at the recent developments in field of\nICT and its penetration in developing countries especially Sri Lanka with\nspecial emphasis to constraints and challenges in adopting ICT for the\nimproving the quality of life of elderly.",

In 2010, Saudi Arabia ranked 58th in\nthe world and 4th in the Gulf region in eGovernment readiness according to\nUnited Nations reports.

While this is\nstill modest in relation to the Saudi government expectation concerning its\nvision for eGovernment implementation for 2010, and the results achieved by the\nneighbouring Gulf countries such as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates on the\neGovernment index, the Saudi government has endeavoured to meet the public\nneeds concerning eGovernment and carry out the implementation of eGovernment\nproperly. Governments may heed the importance of actively launching official\ngovernment websites as the main portals for delivering their online services to\nall the different categories of eGovernment (including G2C, G2B, and G2G).\nHowever, certain Saudi ministries have not given due attention to this vital\nissue.

    "summary": "Mutual information in three (or more) dimensions can be considered as a\nTriple-Helix indicator of synergy in university-industry-government relations.\nAn open-source routine th4.exe makes the computation of this indicator\ninteractively available at the Internet, and thus applicable to large sets of\ndata. Th4.exe computes all probabilistic entropies and mutual information in\ntwo, three, and, if available in the data, four dimensions among, for example,\nclasses such as geographical addresses (cities, regions), technological codes\n(e.g., OECD's NACE codes), and size categories; or, alternatively, among\ninstitutional addresses (academic, industrial, public sector) in document sets.\nThe relations between the Triple-Helix indicator -- as an indicator of synergy\n-- and the Triple-Helix model that specifies the possibility of feedback by an\noverlay of communications, are also discussed.",

Towards\nthis end, we analyze data of 88,637 users who have bought more in total half a\nmilion products from the retailer sites Amazon and Walmart. Our results\nindicate that even coarse-grained Internet browsing behavior has predictive\npower in terms of what users will buy online. Furthermore, we discover both\nsurprising (e.g., \"expensive products do not come with more effort in terms of\npurchase\") and expected (e.g., \"the more loyal a user is to an online shop, the\nless effort they spend shopping\") facts.\n  Given the lack of large-scale studies linking online browsing and online\nshopping behavior, we believe that this work is of general interest to people\nworking in related areas.",

First, we address the spatial\nconcentration by using a distribution analysis at the city level. The results\nsuggest that patenting is concentrated in post-socialist territories more than\nin western nations and regions. However, there is not a single outstanding hub\nin CEE when one compares USPTO patents normalized for the respective population\nsizes. Secondly, we argue that dominance of foreign control over USPTO patents\nis mostly embodied in international co-operations at the individual level, and\nonly rarely spilled-over to MNE subsidiaries. In our opinion, catching-up of\nCEE in terms of patenting is unlikely, unless innovation policy measures focus\non growing hubs and target both domestic inventors and international relations\nof companies.",

    "summary": "Human mobility analysis is an important issue in social sciences, and\nmobility data are among the most sought-after sources of information in ur-\nData ban studies, geography, transportation and territory management. In\nnetwork sciences mobility studies have become popular in the past few years,\nespecially using mobile phone location data. For preserving the customer\nprivacy, datasets furnished by telecom operators are anonymized. At the same\ntime, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all\nobserved trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be\nto sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile\nuser makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of\nusers from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,\ntaking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations\nrecorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:\nhaving more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the\nmost frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated\nonly at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this\nfact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their\ncommunication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in\nterms of spatial and temporal scale. In this paper we propose to estimate the\ncorrelation between the users communication and mo- bility in order to better\nassess the bias of frequency based sampling. Using technical GSM network data\n(including communication but also independent mobility records), we will\nanalyze the relationship between communication and mobility patterns.",

However, existing integration\ntechniques did not pay enough attention to multiple control domains for\nparticipants, i.e. application providers and end-users. In this study, we\nadvocate a global cooperation model for all the participants counts. In\nparticular, we propose a hybrid model to manage the cooperation among\napplications to achieve more optimized allocation of efforts, which means users\nperform lighter actions and application providers concerning less\nuncontrollable information. In addition, we implement the required system and\nshow a case study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this model.",

    "summary": "Data collection is a key component of an information system. The widespread\npenetration of ICT tools in organizations and institutions has resulted in a\nshift in the way the data is collected. Data may be collected in printed-form,\nby e-mails, on a compact disk, or, by direct upload on the management\ninformation system. Since web services are platform-independent, it can access\ndata stored in the XML format from any platform. In this paper, we present an\ninterface which uses web services for data collection. It requires interaction\nbetween a web service deployed for the purposes of data collection, and the web\naddress where the data is stored. Our interface requires that the web service\nhas pre-knowledge of the address from where the data is to be collected. Also,\nthe data to be accessed must be stored in XML format. Since our interface uses\ncomputer-supported interaction on both sides, it eases the task of regular and\nongoing data collection. We apply our framework to the Education Management\nInformation System, which collects data from schools spread across the country.",

Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure\nas a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service)\nare used as business model for Cloud Computing. The paper also introduces the\ncloud computing infrastructure provided by Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web\nService. In this paper we will review the features the educational institutions\ncan use from the cloud computing providers to increase the benefits of students\nand teachers.",

    "summary": "While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends have\nwitnessed an increasing number of people sharing their email passwords with\nfriends, colleagues, and significant others. However, leading websites like\nGoogle advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone, to avoid\nsecurity and privacy breaches. To understand users' general password sharing\nbehavior and practices, we conducted an online survey with 209 Indian\nparticipants and found that 64.35% of the participants felt a need to share\ntheir email passwords. Further, about 77% of the participants said that they\nwould want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to\nmaintain their privacy while sharing emails. To address the privacy concerns of\nusers who need to share emails, we propose ChaMAILeon, a system which enables\nusers to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy.\nChaMAILeon allows users to create multiple passwords for their email account.\nEach such password corresponds to a different set of access control rules, and\ngives a different view of the same email account. We conducted a controlled\nexperiment with 30 participants to evaluate the usability of the system. Each\nparticipant was required to perform 5 tasks. Each task corresponded to\ndifferent access control rules, which the participant was required to set, for\na dummy email account. We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple\nattempts, all 30 participants were able to perform all 5 tasks given to them.\nThe system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of the\nparticipants said that they would like to use ChaMAILeon frequently.",

    "publish": "2013-06-03T11:32:04Z", 
    "summary": "Using a private car is a transportation system very common in industrialized\ncountries. However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil,\ntraffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of\npersonal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e.\nsharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers.\nCarpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide\nenvironmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and\npassengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.\nTypically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on\nhis/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips\nand contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long\ntrips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is\nnot used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering\nthis service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.\nDynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and\nincreasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling\nimpromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street\nand can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no\ndynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize\nsuch systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic\ncarpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of\ndynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It\nproposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic\ncarpooling systems.",

We present the feasibility of the proposed sensing\ntechnique using our implementation on Android phones with different realistic\nscenarios.

    "summary": "Preventive care service delivery faces immense challenges when it comes to\nthe level of coverage. Within this context, the case of child immunization is\npresented by applying operations management tools. This paper explores the\napplication of integer programming techniques to support the Expanded Programme\nof Immunization (EPI) service in the Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan. The\nmain concern here is equitable service delivery to decentralized localities\nbased on two criteria: (1) achieving the highest possible level of vaccination\namong the target population; and 2) ensuring equality among geographically\nscattered populations, especially in rural dwellings. For this purpose two\ninteger programming models have been applied on the basis of (1) sub-dividing\nhealth district into localities and allocating vaccinators to visit and\nvaccinate children within their administrative boundaries, and (2) within the\nlocalized planning system allowing vaccinators to visit and vaccinate children\nacross the administrative boundaries subject to savings in travel time. Both\nmodels show interesting results in terms of need satisfaction and travel-time\nsavings with a minimum level of deviation from equity. The solutions provide a\ntrade-off between alternative organizational tactics, and the argument is made\nthat rational planning methods applied interactively can contribute to the\ndelivery of an immunization service that is equitable and cost effective.",

    "publish": "2013-06-23T17:51:42Z", 
    "summary": "Are there qualitative and quantitative traits of system design that\ncontribute to the ability of people to further innovate? We propose that\nextrinsic adaptability, the ability given to secondary parties to change a\nsystem to match new requirements not envisioned by the primary provider, is\nsuch a trait. \"Extrinsic adaptation\" encompasses the popular concepts of\n\"workaround\", \"fast prototype extension\" or \"hack\", and extrinsic adaptability\nis thus a measure of how friendly a system is to tinkering by curious minds. In\nthis report, we give \"hackability\" or \"hacker-friendliness\" scientific\ncredentials by formulating and studying a generalization of the concept. During\nthis exercise, we find that system changes by secondary parties fall on a\nsubjective gradient of acceptability, with extrinsic adaptations on one side\nwhich confidently preserve existing system features, and invasive modifications\non the other side which are perceived to be disruptive to existing system\nfeatures. Where a change is positioned on this gradient is dependent on how an\nexternal observer perceives component boundaries within the changed system. We\nalso find that the existence of objective cost functions can alleviate but not\nfully eliminate this subjectiveness. The study also enables us to formulate an\nethical imperative for system designers to promote extrinsic adaptability.",

    "summary": "Digital technologies are constantly changing, and with it criminals are\nfinding new ways to abuse these technologies. Cybercrime investigators, then,\nmust also keep their skills and knowledge up to date. This work proposes a\nholistic training development model - specifically focused on cybercrime\ninvestigation - that is based on improving investigator capability while also\nconsidering the capacity of the investigator or unit. Along with a training\ndevelopment model, a cybercrime investigation capacity assessment framework is\ngiven for attempting to measure capacity throughout the education process.\nFirst, a training development model is proposed that focuses on the expansion\nof investigation capability as well as capacity of investigators and units.\nNext, a capacity assessment model is given to evaluate the effectiveness of the\ntraining program. A description of how the proposed model is being applied to\nthe development of training programs for cybercrime investigators in developing\ncountries will then be given, as well as already observed challenges. Finally,\nconcluding remarks as well as proposed future work is discussed.",

    "summary": "Over the years, the Internet has democratized the flow of information.\nUnfortunately, in parallel, authoritarian regimes and other entities (such as\nISPs) for their vested interests have curtailed this flow by partially or fully\ncensoring the web. The policy, mechanism, and extent of this censorship varies\nfrom country to country.\n  We present the first study of the cause, effect, and mechanism of web\ncensorship in Pakistan. Specifically, we use a publicly available list of\nblocked websites and check their accessibility from multiple networks within\nthe country. Our results indicate that the censorship mechanism varies across\nwebsites: some are blocked at the DNS level while others at the HTTP level.\nInterestingly, the government shifted to a centralized, Internet exchange level\ncensorship system during the course of our study, enabling our findings to\ncompare two generations of blocking systems. Furthermore, we report the outcome\nof a controlled survey to ascertain the mechanisms that are being actively\nemployed by people to circumvent censorship. Finally, we discuss some simple\nbut surprisingly unexplored methods of bypassing restrictions.",

    "summary": "The main purpose of this research is to determine the influence of culture on\ne-government (electronic government) acceptance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n(KSA). Citizens' transactional interactions (electronic transactions or\ne-transactions) with the government via the Internet are examined. Multiple\nmodels and theories in extant literature were referred to in identifying the\nresearch context requirements that enabled the analysis of e-transaction\nacceptance. A new research model that fits the research context was developed\nto predict and explain how acceptance is affected. A sample of 671 Saudi\ncitizens was recruited using an online survey. Structural equation modelling\nwas used to assess the impact on intention to use e-transactions. Preference\nfor using e-transactions as a communication method, perceptions of the\ncompatibility of e-transactions with values and citizens' needs,\ncommunicability of the results of using e-transactions, trust in the Internet\nas a medium of communication with the government, and conservation values are\npositive significant determinants of e-transaction acceptance. Conversely, the\ninfluence of trust in government agencies and motivation towards gaining\nprestige and possessing dominance over people and resources was negative. The\nfindings of this study include design and implementation strategies that can\nserve as guidance for the Saudi government, as well as for the developers and\nimplementers of e-transactions in the KSA.",

    "summary": "The rapid spread of mobile phones means that the number of mobile users may\nalready exceed the number of banked people in many low income countries. Mobile\nphones can also offer a communications channel for initiating and executing\non-line financial transactions. This channel may not only reduce the cost of\nfinancial transactions for provider and customer, but also allow new entrants\nto the financial sector, and new relationships to be formed for distributing\nservices. These changes hold the prospect of accelerating access to financial\nservices on the back of the mobile infrastructure. Mobile telephony offers\ntremendous promise to facilitate the flow of money among rural and poor\nfamilies at much lower transaction costs, bringing the bank to those currently\nunbanked. Realizing this promise will require close collaboration among all\nstakeholders. But most rural banks do not have mobile banking services for\ntheir customers. This made it difficult for the full potential and benefits of\nmobile money financial services to be realized. Most telecommunication service\nproviders run mobile money service solely for their subscribers without an\nintegrated approach of incorporating and integrating rural banking systems into\ntheir existing services this makes it difficult for a full fledge exploitation\nof the mobile financial market.

Through review of relevant literature and a\nsystem development methodology, this paper proposes an Automated Intelligent\nDecision Support Human Resource (AIDSS-HR) system that seeks to control and\nmanage employee activities by tracking the number of years a staff has been at\npost, keeping inventory on logistics, analyzing appraisal reports of an\nindividual staff and invoking real time prompts devoid of false alarm. The\nimplementation of AIDSS-HR will improve the performance management of employees\nand benefit the organization, employees and developing nations as a whole.",

    "publish": "2013-08-02T16:08:31Z", 
    "summary": "Gamification is an emerging design principle for information systems where\ngame design elements are applied to non-game contexts. IS researchers have\nsuggested that the IS discipline must study this area but there are other\napplications such as serious games, and simulations that also use games in\nnon-game contexts. Specifically, the management field has been using games and\nsimulations for years and these applications are now being supported by\ninformation systems. We propose in this paper that we must think beyond\ngamification, towards other uses of games in non-gaming contexts, which we call\npurposeful gaming.\n  In this paper we identify how the IS discipline can adapt to purposeful\ngaming. Specifically, we show how IT artifacts, IS design, and IS theories can\nbe used in the purposeful gaming area. We also provide three conceptual\ndimensions of purposeful gaming that can aid IS practitioners and researchers\nto classify and understand purposeful games.",

    "summary": "A Triple Helix (TH) of bi- and trilateral relations among universities,\nindustries, and governments can be considered as an ecosystem in which\nuncertainty can be reduced auto-catalytically. The correlations among the\ndistributions of relations span a vector space in which two vectors (P and Q)\nrepresent \"sending\" and \"receiving,\" respectively. These vectors can also be\nunderstood in terms of the generation versus reduction of uncertainty in the\ncommunication field that results from interactions among the three (bi-lateral)\ncommunication channels. We specify a set of Lotka-Volterra equations between\nthe vectors that can be solved. Redundancy generation can then be simulated and\nthe results can be decomposed in terms of the TH components. Among other\nthings, we show that the strength and frequency of the relations are\nindependent parameters. Different components in terms of frequencies in\ntriple-helix systems can also be distinguished and interpreted using Fourier\nanalysis of the empirical time-series. The case of co-authorship relations in\nJapan is analyzed as an empirical example; but \"triple contingencies\" in an\necosystem of relations can also be considered more generally as a model for\nredundancy generation by providing meaning to the (Shannon-type) information in\ninter-human communications.",

    "summary": ": Introduction-objectives: A virtual-reality learning environment dedicated\nto prostate biopsies was designed to overcome the limitations of current\nclassical teaching methods. The aim of this study was to validate reliability,\nface, content and construct of the simulator. Materials and methods: The\nsimulator is composed of a) a laptop computer, b) a haptic device with a stylus\nthat mimics the ultrasound probe, c) a clinical case database including three\ndimensional (3D) ultrasound volumes and patient data and d) a learning\nenvironment with a set of progressive exercises including a randomized 12-core\nbiopsy procedure. Both visual (3D biopsy mapping) and numerical (score)\nfeedback are given to the user. The simulator evaluation was conducted in an\nacademic urology department on 7 experts and 14 novices who each performed a\nvirtual biopsy procedure and completed a face and content validity\nquestionnaire. Results: The overall realism of the biopsy procedure was rated\nat a median of 9/10 by non-experts (7.1-9.8). Experts rated the usefulness of\nthe simulator for the initial training of urologists at 8.2/10 (7.9-8.3), but\nreported the range of motion and force feedback as significantly less realistic\nthan novices (p=0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Pearson's r correlation\ncoefficient between correctly placed biopsies on the right and left side of the\nprostate for each user was 0.79 (p<0.001). The 7 experts had a median score of\n64% (59-73), and the 14 novices a median score of 52% (43-67), without reaching\nstatistical significance (p=0,19). Conclusion: The newly designed virtual\nreality learning environment proved its versatility and its reliability, face\nand content were validated. Demonstrating the construct validity will require\nimprovements to the realism and scoring system used.",

While difficult, these issues must be addressed if\ngovernments are to engage with their citizens using Social Media.",

The\nsoftware is represented by installing windows server to implement the proposal\ndesign of DLMS4TEF, PHP script is used as web programming that supports the\nserver, where as the HTML and JavaScript are used to support the client side.\nThe dynamic DLMS4TEF will be based on relational database, which is created by\nusing MySQL, to support processing hundreds of queries per second, and the\nKurdish Unicode to support Kurdish fonts of GUI's, Moreover, for security\nDLMS4TEF allows each department in the Foundation to enter its own section and\nprevent accessing other sections by using HTAccessible program which allows the\nuser to access by using his IP address and his computer only. The important\nconclusions and advantages of applying DLMS4TEF are making backup to DLMS4TEF's\ndatabases using the option (zipped) which allows them to reach the size of (3%)\nof the original database size, sufficient security techniques, through\nachieving levels of security, hidden access to the administrator section, and\nfinally DLMS4TEF, when compared with the traditional methods and project of\nOman, shows the same efficiency of some, if not better, features of Oman.\nKeywords- E-management, Client-Server network, Fast-Ethernet, PHP, MySQL",

    "summary": "Human brain activity collected in the form of Electroencephalography (EEG),\neven with low number of sensors, is an extremely rich signal. Traces collected\nfrom multiple channels and with high sampling rates capture many important\naspects of participants' brain activity and can be used as a unique personal\nidentifier. The motivation for sharing EEG signals is significant, as a mean to\nunderstand the relation between brain activity and well-being, or for\ncommunication with medical services. As the equipment for such data collection\nbecomes more available and widely used, the opportunities for using the data\nare growing; at the same time however inherent privacy risks are mounting. The\nsame raw EEG signal can be used for example to diagnose mental diseases, find\ntraces of epilepsy, and decode personality traits. The current practice of the\ninformed consent of the participants for the use of the data either prevents\nreuse of the raw signal or does not truly respect participants' right to\nprivacy by reusing the same raw data for purposes much different than\noriginally consented to. Here we propose an integration of a personal\nneuroinformatics system, Smartphone Brain Scanner, with a general privacy\nframework openPDS. We show how raw high-dimensionality data can be collected on\na mobile device, uploaded to a server, and subsequently operated on and\naccessed by applications or researchers, without disclosing the raw signal.\nThose extracted features of the raw signal, called answers, are of\nsignificantly lower-dimensionality, and provide the full utility of the data in\ngiven context, without the risk of disclosing sensitive raw signal.

This is achieved by using web-based applications including Modern\nMedical Informatics Services which is easier, faster and less expensive. The\nrequired system implements the suitable informatics and electronics solutions\nefficiently for the Tele-medicine care. We proposed an approach to manage\ndifferent multimedia medical databases in the telemedicine system. In order to\nbe efficiently and effectively manage, search, and display database\ninformation, we define an information package for both of doctor and patient as\na concise data set of their medical information from each visit. The\nmethodology for accessing various types of medical records will be provided,\nalso we will design two web-based interfaces, high-quality data and display for\nmany medical service purposes.",

    "publish": "2014-03-20T21:16:55Z", 
    "summary": "In recent years, the amount of information collected about human beings has\nincreased dramatically. This development has been partially driven by\nindividuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online\nsocial networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes\n(quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies\ncollecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational\npower combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to\ninfer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much\nof the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most\nindividuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data\npublicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the\nindividuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts.\nOut of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts\ndirectly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the\nprivacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study\npurposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security\nand sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a\nsurvey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies\nthat collect detailed sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key\nproblems and recommendations for future work are included. We hope the overview\nof the privacy-related practices in massive data collection studies can be used\nas a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on\ndata collection in an academic context, we believe that many of the challenges\nand solutions we identify are also relevant and useful for other domains where\nmassive data collection takes place, including businesses and governments.",

However, how to turn big data\ninto deep insights with tremendous value still remains obscure. To meet the\nchallenge, universal knowledge discovery from big data (UKD) is proposed. The\nnew concept focuses on discovering universal knowledge, which exists in the\nstatistical analyses of big data and provides valuable insights into big data.\nUniversal knowledge comes in different forms, e.g., universal patterns, rules,\ncorrelations, models and mechanisms. To accelerate big data assisted universal\nknowledge discovery, a unified research paradigm should be built based on\ntechniques and paradigms from related research domains, especially big data\nmining and complex systems science. Therefore, I propose an iBEST@SEE\nmethodology. This study lays a solid foundation for the future development of\nuniversal knowledge discovery, and offers a pathway to the discovery of\n\"treasure-trove\" hidden in big data.",

To\nelicit discussion, we take a clean-slate approach and introduce a\nproof-of-concept smart home, dubbed Clome, that decouples non-trivial\ncomputation from home applications and transfers it to the cloud. We also\ndiscuss how a Clome-like smart home with decentralized processing and storage\ncan be enabled through OpenFlow programmable switches, home-centric programming\nplatforms, and thin-client computing.",

    "summary": "The ubiquity of technology in our daily lives and the economic stability of\nthe technology sector in recent years, especially in areas with a computer\nscience footing, has led to an increase in computer science enrollment in many\nparts of the world. To keep up with this trend, the undergraduate computer\nscience curriculum has undergone many revisions, analysis, and discussion.\nUnfortunately, the graduate level curriculum is lagging far behind in computer\nscience education literature and research. To remedy this, we present the\nblueprint and execution of a graduate level course in programming, designed\nspecifically to cater to the needs of graduate students with a diverse\nbackground both in CS and other fields. To this end, the course is divided into\ntwo halves.

    "title": "Improving Computer Assisted Speech Therapy Through Speech Based Emotion   Recognition", 
    "publish": "2014-05-30T08:29:29Z", 
    "summary": "Speech therapy consists in a wide range of services whose aim is to prevent,\ndiagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most\nimportant conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the\n\"immersing\" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at\nhome, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to\nbecome habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of\nhuman SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main\ndistinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based\nSpeech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The\ninability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to\ninadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this \"unresponsive\" behaviour is\nperceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children,\nleads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we\npropose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be\nintegrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality consists\nin both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only\nsubjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy\nrepresentation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task\na difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this\nis the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted\nspeech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our\nCBST.",

From the teacher's point of view, evaluation of learning\naims to determine whether the students have achieved the goals set for a\nparticular topic or course.

Many times the students may actually learn something\ncompletely different from those that are tested. Furthermore, testing does not\nnecessarily take the students' individual needs into account.

    "summary": "Each month, more attacks are launched with the aim of making web users\nbelieve that they are communicating with a trusted entity which compels them to\nshare their personal, financial information. Phishing costs Internet users\nbillions of dollars every year. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)\ncreated an anti-phishing landing page supported by Anti-Phishing Working Group\n(APWG) with the aim to train users on how to prevent themselves from phishing\nattacks. It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors,\ngovernment organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks\non a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the\nlanding page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two\ndatasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from\nSeptember 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April\n30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users\nagainst phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing\nURLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing\npage helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that\nphishers have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate\nlooking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We\nobserved that phishers are exploiting ICANN accredited registrars to launch\ntheir attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that phishers are trying\nto exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this\npaper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by phishers to lure victims\nin 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably\nover time. Phishers have adopted new techniques like sending promotional\ne-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs.",

    "summary": "Recently, it has been proposed to analyse the literary works, plays or\nnovels, using graphs to display the social network of their interacting\ncharacters. In this approach, the timeline of the literary work is lost,\nbecause the storyline is projected on a planar graph. However, timelines can be\nused to build some time series and analyse the work by means of vectors and\nmatrices. These series can be used to describe the presence and relevance, not\nonly of words in the text, but also of persons and places portrayed in the\ndrama or novel. In this framework, we discuss here an approach with\nco-occurrence matrices plotted over time, concerning the presence of characters\nin the pages of a novel. These matrices are similar to those appearing in\nrecurrence plots.",

    "publish": "2014-06-29T19:31:57Z", 
    "summary": "The principles of open collaboration for innovation (and production), once\ndistinctive to open source software, are now found in many other ventures. Some\nof these ventures are internet-based: Wikipedia, online forums and communities.\nOthers are off-line: in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures\nhave been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational\nform. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their\noperating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),\nthe underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for\ninnovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify\nfour defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and\nservices of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they\nlabor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to\ncontribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other\norganizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to\nperformance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational\nmodel, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.\nWe identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the\ncooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree\nto which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,\nwe find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when\ncooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or\ngoods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new\ndomains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms,\ncollaborative and communal.",

However, this is quite challenging to\nbe facilitated with learning technologies like Learning Management Systems\n(LMS) that lack an individualised approach as well as a right balance between\nthe learner's freedom and guidance. Personalisation and adaptive technologies\nhave a high potential to support SRL in Personal Learning Environments (PLE),\nwhich enable customisation and guidance of various strengths and at various\nlevels with SRL widgets. The main contribution of our paper is a framework that\nintegrates guidance and reflection support for SRL in PLEs. Therefore, we have\nelaborated an operational SRL model. On that basis we have implemented a system\nwith a learner model, SRL widgets, monitoring and analytic tools, as well as\nrecommendation functionalities.

Provisioning secondary\naccess to the underutilized spectrum could be beneficial to the incumbents if\nthey could gain significant value out of the fallow spectrum while ensuring\nprotection of their primary services. From an incumbent perspective, the\nspectrum sharing approach needs to be non-harmful as well as efficient. In\norder to make spectrum sharing efficient, it is necessary to maximize the\nspectrum available for secondary access as well as maximize its exploitation.\nWe examine the impact of the conservative assumptions that lead to lesser\navailability of spectrum for secondary access. The problem of joint scheduling\nand spectrum-access footprint allocation is at the heart of maximizing the\nexploitation. This problem is NP-hard and we present a suboptimal approach\nbased on the minimal spectrum consumption cost of a spectrum-access request. In\norder to improve the spectrum sharing potential, we investigate the impact of\nthe various design choices for a spectrum access mechanism.

Continuous monitoring of building occupancy and environment is\nessential to fault detection, intelligent control, and building commissioning.\nThough many solutions for environmental measuring based on wireless sensor\nnetworks exist, they are not easily accessible to households and building\nowners who may lack time or technical expertise needed to set up a system and\nget quick and detailed overview of environmental conditions.\n  Building-in-Briefcase (BiB) is a portable sensor network platform that is\ntrivially easy to deploy in any building environment. Once the sensors are\ndistributed, the environmental data is collected and communicated to the BiB\nrouter via TCP/IP protocol and WiFi technology which then forwards the data to\nthe central database securely over the internet through a 3G radio. The user,\nwith minimal effort, can access the aggregated data and visualize the trends in\nreal time on the BiB web portal. Paramount to the adoption and continued\noperation of an indoor sensing platform is battery lifetime. This design has\nachieved a multi-year lifespan by careful selection of components, an efficient\nbinary communications protocol and data compression. Our BiB sensor is capable\nof collecting a rich set of environmental parameters, and is expandable to\nmeasure others, such as CO2. This paper describes the power characteristics of\nBiB sensors and their occupancy estimation and activity recognition\nfunctionality. Our vision is large-scale deployment of BiB in thousands of\nbuildings, which would provide ample research opportunities and opportunities\nto identify ways to improve the building environment and energy efficiency.",

    "publish": "2014-09-08T09:46:26Z", 
    "summary": "In an era of software crisis, the move of firms towards\ngeographically-distributed software development teams is being challenged by\ncollaboration issues. On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some\nlight, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source\ncommunity have been recurrently reported. While practitioners move with\ndifficulties towards globally distributed software development, there is a lack\nof research addressing the collaboration dynamics of large-scale distributed\nsoftware projects. More particularly, even if there are empirical\nmanifestations of collaboration among software-houses that market\nrival-software products within the same market, there is a clear lack of\nresearch addressing the development of information systems by coopetitive\nmanners. While addressing a previous call for the advancement of methods and\ntechniques to support the visualization of temporal aspects to represent change\nand evolution in ecosystems, we combined and virtual-ethnography (VA) with a\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) over publicly-available and naturally-occurring\ndata that allowed us to re-construct and visualize the evolution of the WebKit\ncollaboration in a sequence of networks. We started by screening, publicly\navailable data such as company announcements, financial reports and\nspecialized-press that allowed us to gain insights of the industrial context.\nAfter attaining a better understanding of the the competitive dynamics of the\nmobile-devices and PC industries, we started extracting and analyzing the\nsocial network of the WebKit community leveraging SNA, which is an emergent\nmethod widely established across disciplines of social sciences in general.Our\ncase confirmed much of the established literature on coopetition, but more\ndetailed observations revealed that not all coopetition theoretical\npropositions can be generalized to the open-source arena.",

    "publish": "2014-09-14T08:48:21Z", 
    "summary": "With the rise of cheap small-cells in wireless cellular networks, there are\nnew opportunities for third party providers to service local regions via\nsharing arrangements with traditional operators. In fact, such arrangements are\nhighly desirable for large facilities---such as stadiums, universities, and\nmines---as they already need to cover property costs, and often have fibre\nbackhaul and efficient power infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new\nnetwork sharing arrangement between large facilities and traditional operators.\nOur facility network sharing arrangement consists of two aspects: leasing of\ncore network access and spectrum from traditional operators; and service\nagreements with users. Importantly, our incorporation of a user service\nagreement into the arrangement means that resource allocation must account for\nfinancial as well as physical resource constraints. This introduces a new\nnon-trivial dimension into wireless network resource allocation, which requires\na new evaluation framework---the data rate is no longer the only main\nperformance metric. Moreover, despite clear economic incentives to adopt\nnetwork sharing for facilities, a business case is lacking. As such, we develop\na general socio-technical evaluation framework based on ruin-theory, where the\nkey metric for the sharing arrangement is the probability that the facility has\nless than zero revenue surplus. We then use our framework to evaluate our\nfacility network sharing arrangement, which offers guidance for leasing and\nservice agreement negotiations, as well as design of the wireless network\narchitecture, taking into account network revenue streams.",

    "publish": "2014-09-18T03:24:49Z", 
    "summary": "Heart rate monitoring using wrist-type photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals\nduring subjects' intensive exercise is a difficult problem, since the signals\nare contaminated by extremely strong motion artifacts caused by subjects' hand\nmovements. So far few works have studied this problem. In this work, a general\nframework, termed TROIKA, is proposed, which consists of signal decomposiTion\nfor denoising, sparse signal RecOnstructIon for high-resolution spectrum\nestimation, and spectral peaK trAcking with verification. The TROIKA framework\nhas high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many\nvariants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental\nresults on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak\nspeed of 15 km/hour showed that the average absolute error of heart rate\nestimation was 2.34 beat per minute (BPM), and the Pearson correlation between\nthe estimates and the ground-truth of heart rate was 0.992. This framework is\nof great values to wearable devices such as smart-watches which use PPG signals\nto monitor heart rate for fitness.",

    "summary": "Games are a popular form of entertainment. However, many computer games\npresent unnecessary barriers to players with sensory, motor and cognitive\nimpairments. In order to overcome such pitfalls, an awareness of their impact\nand a willingness to apply inclusive design practice is often necessary. The\nGlobal Game Jam offers a potential avenue to promote inclusive design practices\nto students of game development. As such, this paper evaluates the impact of an\ninitiative to promote inclusive design practices during the 2014 Global Game\nJam. An attitude questionnaire was distributed to both participants and\nnon-participants at one event venue. The results indicate that, having enrolled\nin the initiative, students' attitudes improved. Furthermore, all attendees\nreported they were likely to pursue further learning opportunities and consider\naccessibility issues in their future games. This suggests that the Global Game\nJam, and other similar events, present an attractive avenue to promote\ninclusive design practice within the context of digital game development.\nHowever, further analysis of submitted games, additional qualitative inquiry\nand a large-scale trial are needed to determine impact on practice and to form\nrecommendations for future events.",

    "publish": "2014-11-19T16:31:38Z", 
    "summary": "Online Behavioural targeted Advertising (OBA) has risen in prominence as a\nmethod to increase the effectiveness of online advertising. OBA operates by\nassociating tags or labels to users based on their online activity and then\nusing these labels to target them. This rise has been accompanied by privacy\nconcerns from researchers, regulators and the press. In this paper, we present\na novel methodology for measuring and understanding OBA in the online\nadvertising market. We rely on training artificial online personas representing\nbehavioural traits like 'cooking', 'movies', 'motor sports', etc. and build a\nmeasurement system that is automated, scalable and supports testing of multiple\nconfigurations. We observe that OBA is a frequent practice and notice that\ncategories valued more by advertisers are more intensely targeted. In addition,\nwe provide evidences showing that the advertising market targets sensitive\ntopics (e.g, religion or health) despite the existence of regulation that bans\nsuch practices. We also compare the volume of OBA advertising for our personas\nin two different geographical locations (US and Spain) and see little\ngeographic bias in terms of intensity of OBA targeting. Finally, we check for\ntargeting with do-not-track (DNT) enabled and discovered that DNT is not yet\nenforced in the web.",

    "publish": "2014-11-24T19:01:39Z", 
    "summary": "Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every year.\nEmergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information,\nsuch as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The\nanalysis of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from\nthe mobile phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize\nhuman behavior during critical events. In this work, we investigate the\nviability of using CDR data combined with other sources of information to\ncharacterize the floods that occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map\nhas been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within\nthis frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have\nbeen analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the\nNASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to\neach cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected\nlocations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the\nfloods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population\ninformation awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has been assessed\nusing census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive\nvalidation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using\ncell tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency\nmanagement mechanisms.",

    "summary": "The Information Systems around patents are complex, their study coupled with\na creative vision of \"out of the box\", overcomes the strict basic functions of\nthe patent. We have, on several occasions, guiding research around the patent\nsolely-based on information, since the writing of new patents ; invalidation of\nexisting patents, the creation of value-added information and their links to\nother Information Systems. The traditional R&D based on heavy investments is\none type of technology transfer. But, patent information is also, another\npowerful tool of technology transfer, innovation and creativity. Indeed,\nconduct research on the patent, from an academic viewpoint, although not always\nfocusing only on financial revenue, can be considered as a form of \"Non\nPracticing Entities\" (NPE) activity, called rightly or wrongly \"Patent Trolls\".\nWe'll see why the term \"patent troll\" for this activity is controversial and\ninappropriate. The research we will describe in this paper falls within this\ncontext. We show two case studies of efficient use of patent information in\nEmerging countries, the first concern the pharmaceutical industry in Brazil and\nthe second, the oil industry in Algeria.",

    "summary": "The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector represents one of the\nfundamental pillars in the trade field. It contributes significantly to raising\nthe economies of countries by providing significant numbers of job\nopportunities, which are beneficial to directly supporting national economies.\nOne of the most important obstacles facing this sector in the information\ntechnology era is the lack of online trading channels with consumers, which\nrequire more financial support than the their capabilities. Therefore, e-Malls\nmight be one of the best low-cost solutions to overcome this obstacle. Also,\nthey provide electronic platforms that include most SME requirements for sales\nvia electronic channels as well as offer essential technical support. According\nto a report published in 2013 by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), the\npercentage of SMEs is equivalent to 90% of the total number of companies in\nSaudi Arabia, which is numbered at 848,500. The e-Mall is a modern idea in\nSaudi Arabia that requires the use of the Disunion Of Innovation (DOI) approach\nto diffuse e-Malls through determining companies requirements and difficulties.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on the factors that help SMEs to adopt e-Malls. A\nquantitative questionnaire was conducted on 108 companies in Saudi Arabia to\nfind what obstacles and requirements they face to adopt an e-Mall and focus on\nthe factors affecting the implementation of this system, which are divided into\norganizational, technical and cultural factors.",

    "summary": "Computer networking is an important specialization in Information and\nCommunication Technologies. However imparting the right knowledge to students\ncan be a challenging task due to the fact that there is not enough time to\ndeliver lengthy labs during normal lecture hours. Augmenting the use of\nphysical machines with software tools help the students to learn beyond the\nlimited lab sessions within the environment of higher Institutions of learning\nthroughout the world. The Institutions focus mostly on effective use of\navailable resources i.e. a lab may have few lab sessions scheduled within a day\nfor different courses. Hence a particular lab session must begin and end on\ntime. A slow student who did not complete his/her lab exercise must vacate the\nlab because another class is about to commence. Hence using free software tools\nsuch as OPNET IT guru, Packet trace and NS2 will help the student to learn\nbeyond the College time. A Student will gain an insight into Computer\nnetworking field by repeatedly doing the same labs at the comfort of his laptop\nor PC at home, hence increasing deeper understanding into the subject.

    "summary": "This paper discusses the general state of information technology in New\nZealand society, current issues, and policies. It is a qualitative study that\nreviews recent scholarly articles, periodicals, and surveys in order to create\nan understanding of some of the information technology issues and trends in New\nZealand. After reviewing previous research, it assesses the potential existence\nand nature of a 'digital divide' in New Zealand society whilst also evaluating\npossible strategic responses to the issue. New Zealand society has rapidly\naccepted emerging online trends as well as achieving an overall high level of\nInternet provision nationally. Through government policy and education, this\nsmall island nation has remained at the forefront of information technology and\ncan be considered somewhat of an e-democracy. However, despite these positives,\nthere is a risk of low-income communities being left behind as New Zealand\nsociety becomes increasingly dependent on IT in the workplace and in\ngovernmental administration.",

    "publish": "2015-04-27T17:58:16Z", 
    "summary": "For money-like informational commodities the notions of architectural\nadequacy and evolutionary adequacy are proposed as the first two stages of a\nmoneyness maturity hierarchy. Then three classes of informational commodities\nare distinguished: exclusively informational commodities, strictly\ninformational commodities, and ownable informational commodities. For each\nclass money-like instances of that commodity class, as well as monies of that\nclass may exist.\n  With the help of these classifications and making use of previous assessments\nof Bitcoin, it is argued that at this stage Bitcoin is unlikely ever to evolve\ninto a money. Assessing the evolutionary adequacy of Bitcoin is perceived in\nterms of a search through its design hull for superior design alternatives.\n  An extensive comparison is made between the search for superior design\nalternatives to Bitcoin and the search for design alternatives to a specific\nand unconventional view on the definition of fractions.",

Using a large sample of forum\ndata culled from 61 courses, we design a binary classifier to predict whether\nan instructor should intervene in a discussion thread or not. By incorporating\nnovel information about a forum's type into the classification process, we\nimprove significantly over the previous state-of-the-art.\n  We show how difficult this decision problem is in the real world by\nvalidating against indicative human judgment, and empirically show the\nproblem's sensitivity to instructors' intervention preferences.

    "publish": "2010-06-04T11:01:25Z", 
    "summary": "In today\\^as world designing adaptable course material requires new technical\nknowledge which involves a need for a uniform protocol that allows organizing\nresources with emphasis on quality and Learning. This can be achieved by\nbundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning\nobjects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely \"Learning\" and\n\"Object\". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since\nEducation is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be\nfacilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning\nobjects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into\nlearning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates\nto the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals\nwith the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs\nare analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy\nhelps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the\ndigital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as\nencapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be\nborrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the\naim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this\nresearch and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework\nfor adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to\nhighlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring.",

    "summary": "Software Development is a core second-year course currently offered to\nundergraduate students at Victoria University at its five local and\ninternational campuses. The project aims to redesign the existing course\ncurriculum to support student-centred teaching and learning. It is intended to\nprovide a learning context in which learners can reflect on new material,\ndiscuss their tentative understandings with others, actively search for new\ninformation, develop skills in communication and collaboration, and build\nconceptual connections to their existing knowledge base. The key feature of the\ncross-campus curriculum innovation is the use of Blackboard, short for\nBlackboard Learning System, to assist in course content organization and online\ndelivery. A well-defined and integrated case study is used throughout the\ncourse to provide realistic practical experience of software development. It\nallows students to take control of their own learning while at the same time\nproviding support to those students who have particular learning difficulties.\nIn this paper, the developed curriculum and the learning outcome are described.\nThe e-Learning material and various Blackboard tools used for teaching and\nlearning activities are presented. Finally, conclusion is drawn from classroom\nexperience.",

    "summary": "In a typical Event-Based Surveillance setting, a stream of web documents is\ncontinuously monitored for disease reporting. A structured representation of\nthe disease reporting events is extracted from the raw text, and the events are\nthen aggregated to produce signals, which are intended to represent early\nwarnings against potential public health threats.\n  To public health officials, these warnings represent an overwhelming list of\n\"one-size-fits-all\" information for risk assessment. To reduce this overload,\ntwo techniques are proposed. First, filtering signals according to the user's\npreferences (e.g., location, disease, symptoms, etc.) helps reduce the\nundesired noise. Second, re-ranking the filtered signals, according to an\nindividual's feedback and annotation, allows a user-specific, prioritized\nranking of the most relevant warnings.\n  We introduce an approach that takes into account this two-step process of: 1)\nfiltering and 2) re-ranking the results of reporting signals. For this,\nCollaborative Filtering and Personalization are common techniques used to\nsupport users in dealing with the large amount of information that they face.",

    "summary": "Digitally engaged communities can be described as communities created and\nevolved within Web 2.0 Websites such as Facebook, Bebo, and Twitter. The\ngrowing importance of digitally engaged communities calls for the need to\nefficiently manage the building blocks of sustaining a healthy community. The\ninitial operation of any digitally-engaged community depends on the existence\nof its own members, the beneficial values created and exchanged, and the\nrelationships interlinking both. However, the level of contribution and\ninvolvement might vary depending on the benefits being gratified from engaging\nin such communities. In other words, motivations for participating and getting\ninvolved are purposive; individuals are driven into joining and /or taking part\nin any digitallyengaged network for capturing and purtaining certain beneficial\nvalues. Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework that classifies the values\ncreated and exchanged within these communities as well as the roles adopted and\nplayed by users of these communities. Utilizing ethnography as the primay\nmethodological strategy to study Bebo digitally-engaged community, this\nresearch identifies five different roles of users: Newbie, Lurker, Novice,\nInsider, and Leader. Moreover, the research also identifies five value elements\nthat could be captured by different users: Social, Hedonic, Epistemic, Gift,\nand Utilitarian. The results of this study provides insights for decision and\npolicy makers, service providers, and developers; as it inspires them in\nknowing and meeting the needs and values of participants based on the roles\nadopted by users.",

    "summary": "Cyber-crime targeting children such as online pedophile activity are a major\nand a growing concern to society. A deep understanding of predatory chat\nconversations on the Internet has implications in designing effective solutions\nto automatically identify malicious conversations from regular conversations.\nWe believe that a deeper understanding of the pedophile conversation can result\nin more sophisticated and robust surveillance systems than majority of the\ncurrent systems relying only on shallow processing such as simple word-counting\nor key-word spotting.\n  In this paper, we study pedophile conversations from the perspective of\nonline grooming theory and perform a series of linguistic-based empirical\nanalysis on several pedophile chat conversations to gain useful insights and\npatterns. We manually annotated 75 pedophile chat conversations with six stages\nof online grooming and test several hypothesis on it. The results of our\nexperiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online\ngrooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used\nword-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of\nthe six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful\nto improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore,\nwe present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile\nconversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to\nanother, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online\ngrooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online\ngrooming stages.",

However, we are not seeing this loose coupling yet in the\ncurrent market. We argue that the reason for this is economical: a market\nframework in which loosely coupled software parties are adequately rewarded is\nnot yet in place. We describe a technical solution for creating the needed\nmarket framework, consisting of an automated micropayment system by which money\ncan flow from appcessory hardware makers to app software innovators. This\nsolution also has a broader applicability to the problem of innovation in the\nInternet of Things.",

The computing industry is witnessing a paradigm shift in the way\ncomputing is performed worldwide. There is a growing awareness among consumers\nand enterprises to access their IT resources extensively through a \"utility\"\nmodel known as \"cloud computing.\" Cloud computing was initially rooted in\ndistributed grid-based computing. It has become a significant technology trend\nand expect that cloud computing will reshape IT processes and the IT\nmarketplace. With the cloud computing technology, clients use a variety of\nsmart mobile devices to access programs, storage, and application-development\nplatforms over the network and internet, through services offered by cloud\ncomputing providers.An innovative new way to boost capacity and add\ncapabilities in computing without spending money on a new infrastructure,\ntraining new personnel or licensing software is one of the characteristics of a\ncloud computing. Demands for fastest access to information is changing and\nincreasing, therefore, the availability of cloud computing has made it easier\nfor organizations to share and store related data and information with their\nstakeholders.Moreover, cloud computing is the use of internet-based services to\nsupport business processes.Our research is to find out what the demand and main\nemphasized of cloud computing compared with efficiency, trendy and security\nthat leads to improved business processes within corporate as cloud user.",

Methods: The pilot course was set up on Moodle, an\nopen-source online learning environment, and facilitated by the author. The\nlessons and assignment were spread over six weeks, followed by a two-week\nextension period. Twenty-eight faculty members of the National University of\nRwanda enrolled themselves in the course. Results: Twenty-five of the 28\nlearners completed the course. After the course, these learners expressed high\nsatisfaction, e.g, 24 of them felt that they were ready to write a research\npaper for publication. Conclusion: The high completion rate (89%) is noteworthy\nfor two reasons: e-learning courses tend to have lower completion rates than\nclassroom courses, and 76% of the learners in the pilot course had not taken an\ne-learning course before. This result and the positive feedback indicate that\nonline courses can benefit researchers in developing countries who may not have\naccess to classroom courses on research writing.",

    "summary": "Latest study shows that MCL is highly focusing paradigm for research\nparticularity in distance and online education. MCL provides some features and\nfunctionalities for all participants to obtain the knowledge. Deployment of new\nemerging technologies and fast growing trends toward MCL boom attract people to\ndevelop learning management system, virtual learning environment and conference\nsystem with support of MCL. All these environments lack the most promising\nsupportive framework. In addition some of major challenges in open, large\nscale, dynamic and heterogeneous environments are not still handled in\ndeveloping MCL for education and other organizations. These issues includes\nsuch as knowledge sharing, faster delivery of contents, request for modified\ncontents, complete access to enterprise data warehouse, delivery of large rich\nmultimedia contents (video-on-demand), asynchronous collaboration, synchronous\ncollaboration, support for multi model, provision for archive updating, user\nfriendly interface, middleware support and virtual support.

Relationship quality (RQ) is replacing service quality as a key\nsource of superior performance and competitive advantage. Accordingly, this\nstudy investigates the dimensions of relationship quality from e-Banking\nservices and explores the differences among customers of Jordanian and foreign\nbanks. Many of the foreign banks in Jordan are equipped with large financial\ncapital, having high banking and financial experiences and are offering many\nmodern hi-tech banking services.

With the present and advances in information and communication\ntechnology, sharing information and exchanging of data across organizations has\nbecome more feasible in organization. However, information sharing has been a\ncomplex task over the years and identifying factors that influence information\nsharing across organization has becomes crucial and critical. Researchers have\ntaken several methods and approaches to resolve problems in information sharing\nat all levels without a lasting solution, as sharing is best understood as a\npractice that reflects behavior, social, economic, legal and technological\ninfluences. Due to the limitation of the conventional ISM3 standards to address\nculture, social, legislation and human behavior, the findings in this paper\nsuggest that, a centralized information structure without human practice,\ndistribution of information and coordination is not effective.

    "summary": "The notion of patient's consent plays a major role in granting access to\nmedical data. In typical healthcare systems, consent is captured by a form that\nthe patient has to fill in and sign. In e-Health systems, the paper-form\nconsent is being replaced by the integration of the notion of consent in the\nmechanisms that regulate the access to the medical data. This helps in\nempowering the patient with the capability of granting and revoking consent in\na more effective manner. However, the process of granting and revoking consent\ngreatly varies according to the situation in which the patient is. Our main\nargument is that such a level of detail is very difficult and error-prone to\ncapture as a set of authorisation policies. In this paper, we present ACTORS, a\ngoal-driven approach to manage consent. The main idea behind ACTORS is to\nleverage the goal-driven approach of Teleo-Reactive (TR) programming for\nmanaging consent that takes into account changes regarding the domains and\ncontexts in which the patient is providing her consent.",

    "summary": "Contemporary ways of doing business are heavily dependent on the\ne-Commerce/e-Business paradigm. The highest priority of an e-Commerce Web\nsite's management is to assure pertinent Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels of\ntheir Web services continually, in order to keep the potential e-Customers\nsatisfied. Otherwise, it faces an immense possibility of losing both\ne-Customers and revenues, along with a big possibility of gaining bad\nreputation due to either poor performance or unavailability of the e-Commerce\nWeb site. In order to avoid numerous unpleasant consequences, by designing and\nimplementing e-Commerce Web sites that will always meet e-Customer's high\nexpectations, a relevant performance models have to be utilized to obtain\nappropriate performance metrics. A continuous assessment of current\nperformances and especially predicting future needs are the subjects of\ncapacity planning methodologies. Within this paper, such a predictive model has\nbeen described and evaluated by using discrete-event simulation of both the\nclient-side and server-side processes involved. In addition, the paper\ndiscusses the performance metrics obtained as a function of the intensity and\nquality of the workload parameters.",

    "summary": "With an upsurge in financial accounting fraud in the current economic\nscenario experienced, financial accounting fraud detection (FAFD) has become an\nemerging topic of great importance for academic, research and industries. The\nfailure of internal auditing system of the organization in identifying the\naccounting frauds has lead to use of specialized procedures to detect financial\naccounting fraud, collective known as forensic accounting. Data mining\ntechniques are providing great aid in financial accounting fraud detection,\nsince dealing with the large data volumes and complexities of financial data\nare big challenges for forensic accounting. This paper presents a comprehensive\nreview of the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the\ndetection of financial accounting fraud and proposes a framework for data\nmining techniques based accounting fraud detection. The systematic and\ncomprehensive literature review of the data mining techniques applicable to\nfinancial accounting fraud detection may provide a foundation to future\nresearch in this field. The findings of this review show that data mining\ntechniques like logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian belief network, and\ndecision trees have been applied most extensively to provide primary solutions\nto the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent\ndata.",

Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and\nleverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered abundant\nvirtual landmarks, to reset the accumulated error and achieve accurate\nlocalization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only\nenergy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other\npurposes. We present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing\nto automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation\nresults from implementation on different android devices in both city and\nhighway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4m median\nerror in city roads and 16.6m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other\nstate-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%,\nachieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging\nin-city driving conditions.",

    "summary": "The need for process improvement is an important target that does affect as\nwell the government processes. Specifically in the public sector there are\nspecific challenges to face.New technology approaches within government\nprocesses such as cloud services are necessary to address these challenges.\nFollowing the current discussion of cloudification of business processes all\nprocesses are considered similar in regards to their usability within the\ncloud. The truth is, that neither all processes have the same usability for\ncloud services not do they have the same importance for a specific company.The\nmost comprehensive process within a company is the corporate value chain. In\nthis article one key proposition is to use the corporate value chain as the\nfundamental structuring backbone for all business process analysis and\nimprovement activities. It is a pre-requisite to identify the core elements of\nthe value chain that are essential for the individual companys business and the\nroot cause for any company success. In this paper we propose to use the\ncompany-specific value-creation for the cloud-affinity and the cloud-usability\nof a business process in public sector considering the specific challenges of\naddressing processes in cloud services. Therefor it is necessary to formalize\nthe way the processes with its interdependencies are documented in context of\ntheir company-specific value chain (as part of the various deployment- and\ngovernance alternatives. Moreover, it is essential in the public sector to\ndescribe in detail the environmental and external restrictions of processes.\nWith the use of this proposed methodology it becomes relatively easy to\nidentify cloud-suitable processes within the public sector and thus optimize\nthe public companies value generation tightly focused with the use of this new\ntechnology.",

    "publish": "2013-10-10T15:59:07Z", 
    "summary": "Location-based services gained much popularity through providing users with\nhelpful information with respect to their current location. The search and\nrecommendation of nearby locations or places, and the navigation to a specific\nlocation are some of the most prominent location-based services. As a recent\ntrend, virtual location-based services consider webpages or sites associated\nwith a location as 'virtual locations' that online users can visit in spite of\nnot being physically present at the location. The presence of links between\nvirtual locations and the corresponding physical locations (e.g., geo-location\ninformation of a restaurant linked to its website), allows for novel types of\nservices and applications which constitute virtual location-based services\n(VLBS). The quality and potential benefits of such services largely depends on\nthe existence of websites referring to physical locations. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the usefulness of linking virtual and physical locations. For this,\nwe analyze the presence and distribution of virtual locations, i.e., websites\nreferring to places, for two Irish cities. Using simulated tracks based on a\nuser movement model, we investigate how mobile users move through the Web as\nvirtual space. Our results show that virtual locations are omnipresent in urban\nareas, and that the situation that a user is close to even several such\nlocations at any time is rather the normal case instead of the exception.",

Half a million data at firm level in 2011 were\nobtained from the Orbis database of Bureau Van Dijk. The firm level data were\naggregated at the levels of eight Federal Districts, the regional level of 83\nFederal Subjects, and the single level of the Russian Federation. Not\nsurprisingly, the knowledge base of the economy is concentrated in the Moscow\nregion (22.8%); St. Petersburg follows with 4.0%. Only 0.4% of the firms are\nclassified as high-tech, and 2.7% as medium-tech manufacturing (NACE, Rev. 2).\nExcept in Moscow itself, high-tech manufacturing does not add synergy to any\nother unit at any of the various levels of geographical granularity; instead it\ndisturbs regional coordination even in the region surrounding Moscow (\"Moscow\nRegion\"). In the case of medium-tech manufacturing, there is also synergy in\nSt. Petersburg. Knowledge-intensive services (KIS; including laboratories)\ncontribute 12.8% to the economy in terms of establishments and contribute to\nthe synergy in all Federal Districts (except the North-Caucasian Federal\nDistrict), but only in 30 of the 83 Federal Subjects. The synergy in KIS is\nconcentrated in centers of administration.

    "summary": "Land use classification is essential for urban planning. Urban land use types\ncan be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as\nreflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have\nbeen recognized as a vital method for urban land use classification because of\ntheir ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although\nsignificant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for\nurban land use classification, most techniques focus on physical\ncharacteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used.\nOwing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which\ncan be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to\nindicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the\nopportunity to derive land use information from mobile phone data. To verify\nthe application of this new data source to urban land use classification, we\nfirst construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize\nland use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly\nrelative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means\nclustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is\nvalidated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is\ndetermined with a detection rate of 58.03%. An analysis of the land use\nclassification results shows that the accuracy decreases as the heterogeneity\nof land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers\nincreases.",

    "summary": "Geospatial applications are becoming indispensible part of information\nsystems, they provides detailed informations regarding the attribute data of\nspatial objects in real world. Due to the rapid technological developments in\nweb based geographical information systems, the uses of web based geospatial\napplication varies from Geotagging to Geolocation capabilities. Therefore,\neffective utilization of web based information system can only be realized by\nrepresenting the world in its original view, where attributes data of spatial\nobjects are integrated with spatial object and available for the user on the\nweb, using integrated Google API and Google Earth API. In this study a city in\nthe south-western part of Nigeria called EDE is examined and used as a case\nstudy. Using Google Map API and Google Earth API, the attribute data of the\nstudy area stored in XML databases will be integrated with the corresponding\nexisting spatial data of the study area; to create a web based 3D geospatial\napplication. We envisage that this system will enhance the effectiveness of\nweb-based Geographical Information System (GIS) and the overall user\nexperience.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a collaborative 3D GIS to support public participation.\nRealizing that public-involved decision making is often a multi-stage process,\nthe proposed system is designed to provide coherent support for collaborations\nin the different stages. We differentiate ubiquitous participation and\nintensive participation, and identify their suitable application stages. The\nproposed system, then, supports both of the two types of participation by\nproviding synchronous and asynchronous collaboration functionalities. Applying\nthe concept of Digital Earth, the proposed system also features a virtual\nglobe-based user interface. Such an interface integrates a variety of data,\nfunctions and services into a unified virtual environment which is delivered to\nboth experts and public participants through the Internet. The system has been\ndesigned as a general software framework, and can be tailored for specific\nprojects. In this study, we demonstrate it using a scene modeling case and\nprovide a preliminary evaluation towards its usability.",

    "summary": "Literature has shown that countries such as Brazil and India have\nsuccessfully implemented electronic voting systems and other countries are at\nvarious piloting stages to address many challenges associated with manual paper\nbased system such ascosts of physical ballot paper and other overheads,\nelectoral delays, distribution of electoral materials, and general lack of\nconfidence in the electoral process. It is in this context that this study\nexplores how South African can leverage the opportunities that e-voting\npresents. Manual voting is often tedious, non-secure, and time-consuming, which\nleads us to think about using electronic facilities to make the process more\nefficient. This study proposes that the adoption of electronic voting\ntechnologies could perhaps mitigate some of these issues and challengesin the\nprocess improving the electoral process. The study used an on-line\nquestionnaire which was administered to a broader group of voters and an\nin-depth semi-structured interview with the Independent Electoral Commission\nofficials. The analysis is based on thematic analysis and diffusion of\ninnovations theory is adopted as a theoretical lens of analysis. The findings\nreveal that relative advantage, compatibility and complexity would determine\nthe intentions of South African voters and the Electoral Management Bodies\n(IEC) to adopt e-voting technologies. Moreover, the findings also reveal\nseveral other factorsthat could influence the adoption process. The study is\nlimited to only voters in Cape Town and these voters were expected to have some\naccess to the internet. The sample size limits the generalizability of the\nfindings of this study.",

    "publish": "2013-12-06T09:30:27Z", 
    "summary": "For a moment, imagine an active online learning community of writers,\nartists, and designers, many spending more than eight hours a week composing\nprojects. In this community, young people, primarily between the ages of 18-26,\nregularly critique, facilitate, and support each other in their composition\nactivities. They are motivated to participate by their shared interest and\naffinity for their creative work. In the age of Wikipedia, this might not seem\nparticularly novel, but what I am actually describing is an online discussion\nboard, RPGmakerVX.net. Elsewhere, I have presented a general outline of the\nkinds of individuals involved in this community and the way that the site as a\nwhole functions as an open learning environment (Owens, 2010). In this essay, I\npresent a case study of one participant in this community. His user name is Mr.\nMoo, and at the time I interviewed him, he was a 19 year old college student\nfrom Calgary, Canada. When he created his first role-playing game, Prelude of\nIdentity, he was eighteen. After providing a conceptual context for this case\nstudy in work on collective intelligence, I draw out the relationship between\nthe technical system of the discussion boards and the creative process of\nengaging with peers in the production of a video game. I suggest that the\ndiscussion board rules and interaction enable a dialogue around composition\nthat ultimately leaves Mr. Moo with a valuable learning experience while also\nproducing a role-playing game. Thinking about this system from the perspective\nof collective intelligence enables us to use these kinds of interest-driven,\nonline affinity communities as tools in an open education tool kit for\neducators in more formal learning environments. Ultimately, discussion boards\nin gaming communities, both the technical and social systems they represent,\ncould be thought of as instructional tools.",

Earlier, people were not very restrictive in sharing their\npersonal information, but now they are more cautious in sharing it with\nstrangers, either in person or online. With such privacy expectations and\nattitude of people, it is difficult to embrace the fact that a lot of\ninformation is publicly available on the web. Information portals in the form\nof the e-governance websites run by Delhi Government in India provide access to\nsuch PII without any anonymization. Several databases e.g., Voterrolls, Driving\nLicence number, MTNL phone directory, PAN card serve as repositories of\npersonal information of Delhi residents. This large amount of available\npersonal information can be exploited due to the absence of proper written law\non privacy in India. PII can also be collected from various social networking\nsites like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus etc. where the users share some\ninformation about them. Since users themselves put this information, it may not\nbe considered as a privacy breach, but if the information is aggregated, it may\ngive out much more information resulting in a bigger threat. To bring such\nissues to public notice, we developed Open-source Collation of eGovernment data\nAnd Networks (OCEAN), a system where the user enters little information (e.g.\nName) about a person and gets large amount of personal information about him /\nher like name, age, address, date of birth, mother's name, father's name, voter\nID, driving licence number, PAN.",

This paper depicts the\njourney of local self-governance from antediluvian time to 21st century.\nFurther, in the current scenario Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\nhas emerged as a successful tool for dissemination of various e-governance\nservices and in this regard the Government of India has formulated NeGP with\nadequate service delivery mechanism. With the inculcation of ICT, various\napplications were designed by central as well as state governments which lead\ntowards strengthening of PRIs for rural reform.

    "summary": "Shame has clear biological roots and its precise form of expression affects\nsocial cohesion and cultural characteristics. Here we explore the relative\nimportance between shame and guilt by using Google Translate to produce\ntranslation for the words shame, guilt, pain, embarrassment and fear to the 64\nlanguages covered. We also explore the meanings of these concepts among the\nYanomami, a horticulturist hunter-gatherer tribe in the Orinoquia. Results show\nthat societies previously described as 'guilt societies' have more words for\nguilt than for shame, but the large majority, including the societies\npreviously described as 'shame societies', have more words for shame than for\nguilt. Results are consistent with evolutionary models of shame which predict a\nwide scatter in the relative importance between guilt and shame, suggesting\nthat cultural evolution of shame has continued the work of biological\nevolution, and that neither provides a strong adaptive advantage to either\nshame or guilt. We propose that the study of shame will improve our\nunderstanding of the interaction between biological and cultural evolution in\nthe evolution of cognition and emotions.",

    "summary": "Elder people are becoming a predominant aspect of our societies. As such,\nsolutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. The approach\npursued so far to solve this problem used to increase the number of people\nworking in the health sector, e.g. doctors, nurses, etc. This increases the\ncosts, which is becoming a big burden for countries. In this paper we propose a\nnew concept in the health management of elder people, which we name as\n\"participant\". We propose the \"participant\" concept to encourage elder people\nto participate in those group activities that they are able to. Their roles in\nthese activities are not passively requesting help, but actively participating\nto some healthcare processes. Characteristics of the participant approach are\nthat medical resources are efficiently spared with this model, and the social\nnetwork of the elder people is kept. A \"virtual community\" for mutual\nassistance is set up in this paper, and the simulations demonstrate that the\n\"participant\" model could fully utilize the community resources.

    "summary": "With the increase of the populations, resources are becoming scarcer, and a\nsmarter way to make use of them becomes a vital necessity of our societies. On\nthe other hand, resource management is traditionally carried out through well\nestablished organizations, policies, and regulations that are often considered\nas impossible to restructure. Our position is that merely expanding the\ntraditional approaches might not be enough. Systems must be radically rethought\nin order to achieve a truly effective and rational use of the available\nresources. Classical concepts such as demand and supply need to be rethought as\nwell, as they operate artificial classifications that limit the true potential\nof systems and organizations. In what follows we propose our vision to future,\n\"smarter\" systems able to overcome the limitations of the status quo. Such\nsystems require what Boulding called \"gestalts,\" namely concepts able to\n\"directing research towards the gaps which they reveal\". In this paper we\nelaborate on this and show how such gestalts can pave the way towards novel\nreformulations of traditional services able to reach a better and more sensible\nmanagement of the available resources and cope with their scarcity. Our vision\nof a Service-oriented Community is also introduced. We believe that such\ncommunities---in heterarchical coexistence with traditional systems---provide\nthe necessary diversity and innovation orientation to prevent societal lock-ins\nsuch as the ones we are experiencing in assisting our elderly ones.",

    "summary": "Resilience is widely recognized as an important design goal though it is one\nthat seems to escape a general and consensual understanding. Often mixed up\nwith other system attributes; traditionally used with different meanings in as\nmany different disciplines; sought or applied through diverse approaches in\nvarious application domains, resilience in fact is a multi-attribute property\nthat implies a number of constitutive abilities. To further complicate the\nmatter, resilience is not an absolute property but rather it is the result of\nthe match between a system, its current condition, and the environment it is\nset to operate in. In this paper we discuss this problem and provide a\ndefinition of resilience as a property measurable as a system-environment fit.\nThis brings to the foreground the dynamic nature of resilience as well as its\nhard dependence on the context. A major problem becomes then that, being a\ndynamic figure, resilience cannot be assessed in absolute terms. As a way to\npartially overcome this obstacle, in this paper we provide a number of\nindicators of the quality of resilience. Our focus here is that of collective\nsystems, namely those systems resulting from the union of multiple individual\nparts, sub-systems, or organs. Through several examples of such systems we\nobserve how our indicators provide insight, at least in the cases at hand, on\ndesign flaws potentially affecting the efficiency of the resilience strategies.\nA number of conjectures are finally put forward to associate our indicators\nwith factors affecting the quality of resilience.",

    "summary": "Transit fare arbitrage is the scenario when two or more commuters agree to\nswap tickets during travel in such a way that total cost is lower than\notherwise. Such arbitrage allows pricing inefficiencies to be explored and\nexploited, leading to improved pricing models. In this paper we discuss the\nbasics of fare arbitrage through an intuitive pricing framework involving\npopulation density. We then analyze the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit\n(BART) system to understand underlying inefficiencies. We also provide source\ncode and comprehensive list of pairs of trips with significant arbitrage gain\nat github.com/asifhaque/transit-arbitrage. Finally, we point towards a uniform\npayment interface for different kinds of transit systems.",

    "summary": "Due to the evolving Cloud Computing paradigm, there is a prevailing concern\nthat in the near future data center managers may be in short supply. Cloud\ncomputing, as a whole, is becoming more prevalent into today s computing world.\nIn fact, cloud computing has become so popular that some are now referring to\ndata centers as cloud centers. How does this interest in cloud computing\ntranslate into employment rates for data center managers? The popularity of the\npublic and private cloud models are the prevailing force behind answering this\nquestion. Therefore, the skill set of the datacenter manager has evolved to\nharness the on demand self-services, broad network access, resource pooling,\nrapid elasticity, measured service, and multi tenacity characteristics of cloud\ncomputing. Using diverse sources ranging from the Bureau of Labor and\nStatistics to trade articles, this manuscript takes an in-depth look at these\nemployment rates related to the cloud and the determining factors behind them.\nBased on the information available, datacenter manager employment rates in the\ncloud computing era will continue to increase well into 2016.",

    "summary": "While Artificial Intelligence has successfully outperformed humans in complex\ncombinatorial games (such as chess and checkers), humans have retained their\nsupremacy in social interactions that require intuition and adaptation, such as\ncooperation and coordination games. Despite significant advances in learning\nalgorithms, most algorithms adapt at times scales which are not relevant for\ninteractions with humans, and therefore the advances in AI on this front have\nremained of a more theoretical nature. This has also hindered the experimental\nevaluation of how these algorithms perform against humans, as the length of\nexperiments needed to evaluate them is beyond what humans are reasonably\nexpected to endure (max 100 repetitions). This scenario is rapidly changing, as\nrecent algorithms are able to converge to their functional regimes in shorter\ntime-scales. Additionally, this shift opens up possibilities for experimental\ninvestigation: where do humans stand compared with these new algorithms? We\nevaluate humans experimentally against a representative element of these\nfast-converging algorithms. Our results indicate that the performance of at\nleast one of these algorithms is comparable to, and even exceeds, the\nperformance of people.",

    "publish": "2014-10-09T08:34:40Z", 
    "summary": "Interest has been revived in the creation of a \"bill of rights\" for Internet\nusers. This paper analyzes users' rights into ten broad principles, as a basis\nfor assessing what users regard as important and for comparing different\nmulti-issue Internet policy proposals. Stability of the principles is\ndemonstrated in an experimental survey, which also shows that freedoms of users\nto participate in the design and coding of platforms appear to be viewed as\ninessential relative to other rights. An analysis of users' rights frameworks\nthat have emerged over the past twenty years similarly shows that such\nproposals tend to leave out freedoms related to software platforms, as opposed\nto user data or public networks. Evaluating policy frameworks in a comparative\nanalysis based on prior principles may help people to see what is missing and\nwhat is important as the future of the Internet continues to be debated.",

    "summary": "The purpose of this study is to establish whether the use of information\ntechnology (IT) by elected municipal representatives, for constituency work,\nemboldens the adoption of e-service in municipals of a developing country. The\nresearch data was obtained through the completion of a questionnaire by a\nsample of respondents who serve as authorities of IT in South African\nmunicipals. The findings from both descriptive and inferential data analysis of\ncollected data confirm that the use of IT by elected municipal representatives\nfor constituency work impacts the adoption of e-service in municipals.\nFurthermore, the use of IT by elected municipal representatives for\nconstituency work correlated with both e-service laws and e-service security.\nThis study contributes to a better understanding of choices needed when\nplanning for the adoption of e-service initiatives in municipals of developing\ncountries. Given that 87.2% of respondents are aware of a high access to\ntelephone mobile, a further research is needed to clarify why most elected\nmunicipal representatives of a developing country choose not to exploit IT for\ntheir constituency work, and similarly why municipals of a developing country\ndo not exploit IT to provide services.",

    "publish": "2014-10-14T08:52:06Z", 
    "summary": "Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence,\nweb-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases,\nviable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. The popularity of these\nsystems stems from their ability to make education available to a large\ndemographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of\nthe personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:\nthey continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first\nsystematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.\nPersonalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided\npersonalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes\nalready taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific\ncontext, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching\nmaterials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be\nadapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,\nlikes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,\nis able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching\nmethodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a\nstudent) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the\ntime spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We\nillustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor\nplatform which is used for remedial training for a Digital Signal Processing\n(DSP) course.",

    "summary": "Several ICT studies give anecdotal evidences showing privacy to be an area of\nconcern that can influence adoption of technology in the developing world.\nHowever, in-depth understanding of end users' privacy attitudes and awareness\nis largely unexplored in developing countries such as India. We conducted a\nsurvey with 10,427 Indian citizens to bring forth various insights on privacy\nexpectations and perceptions of end users. Our study explores end-users'\nprivacy expectations on three ICT platforms - mobile phones, OSN (Online Social\nNetwork), and government projects. Our results, though preliminary, show that\nusers disproportionately consider financial details as personal information in\ncomparison to medical records. Users heavily use mobile phones to store\npersonal details and show high trust in mobile service providers for protecting\nthe private data. However, users show concerns that mobile service provider may\nallow improper access of their personal information to third parties and\ngovernment. We also find that female participants in the study were marginally\nmore conscious of their privacy than males. To the best of our knowledge, this\nwork presents the largest privacy study which benchmarks privacy perceptions\namong Indian citizens. Understanding users' privacy perceptions can help\nimprove technology adoption and develop policies and laws for improving\ntechnology experience and enabling development for a better life in India.",

For high-security labs, it can be utilized as an\nultra-portable and secure digital notebook solution, since it is functionally\nself-contained, and does not require any server-side process running on either\nthe local or a remote system. Finally, the W3C XML Schema language is used to\ndefine a list of rules, namely a data standard, that an SLN file must conform\nto in order to be valid. In this way, developers are able to implement their\nown validation functions in their projects, or use one of the freely available\ntools to check if a data file is properly structured.

This paper describes an experience in engaging a large\nnumber of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary\nresearch effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in\nComputer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical\nEngineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping),\nand Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a\nstudent project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires\ninteraction with at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long\nprojects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school,\nundergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical\nEngineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate\nstudent learning are real-world system development constraints, regular\ncross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student\nmentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches, a survey was\nconducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the approaches.

In fact, Big Data is like crude! It's valuable, but if unrefined it\ncannot be used. It must be broken down, analyzed for it to have value. But what\nabout Big Data generated by the Petroleum Industry and particularly its\nupstream segment?\n  Upstream is no stranger to Big Data. Understanding and leveraging data in the\nupstream segment enables firms to remain competitive throughout planning,\nexploration, delineation, and field development. Oil & Gas Companies conduct\nadvanced geophysics modeling and simulation to support operations where 2D, 3D\n& 4D Seismic generate significant data during exploration phases. They closely\nmonitor the performance of their operational assets. To do this, they use\nthousands sensors in subsurface wells and surface facilities to provide\ncontinuous and real-time monitoring of assets and environmental conditions.\nUnfortunately, this information comes in various and increasingly complex\nforms, making it a challenge to collect, interpret, and leverage the disparate\ndata.\n  Big Data technologies integrate common and disparate data sets to deliver the\nright information at the appropriate time to the correct decision-maker. These\ncapabilities help firms act on large volumes of data, transforming\ndecision-making from reactive to proactive and optimizing all phases of\nexploration, development and production. Furthermore, Big Data offers multiple\nopportunities to ensure safer, more responsible operations. Another invaluable\neffect of that would be shared learning.\n  The aim of this paper is to explain how to use Big Data technologies to\noptimize operations.

    "summary": "People treat smartphones as a second skin, having them around nearly 24/7 and\nconstantly interacting with them. Although smartphones are used mainly for\npersonal communication, social networking and web browsing, they have many\nconnectivity capabilities, and are at the same time equipped with a wide range\nof embedded sensors. Additionally, bluetooth connectivity can be leveraged to\ncollect data from external sensors, greatly extending the sensing capabilities.\nHowever, massive data-gathering using smartphones still poses many\narchitectural challenges, such as limited battery and processing power, and\npossibly connectivity costs.\n  This article describes SenseMyCity (SMC), an Internet of Things mobile urban\nsensor that is extensible and fully configurable. The platform consists of an\napp, a backoffice and a frontoffice. The SMC app can collect data from embedded\nsensors, like GPS, wifi, accelerometer, magnetometer, etc, as well as from\nexternal bluetooth sensors, ranging from On-Board Diagnostics gathering data\nfrom vehicles, to wearable cardiac sensors. Adding support for new internal or\nexternal sensors is straightforward due to the modular architecture. Data\ntransmission to our servers can occur either on-demand or in real-time, while\nkeeping costs down by only using the configured type of Internet connectivity.\nWe discuss our experience implementing the platform and using it to make\nlongitudinal studies with many users. Further, we present results on bandwidth\nutilization and energy consumption for different sensors and sampling rates.\nFinally, we show two use cases: mapping fuel consumption and user stress\nextracted from cardiac sensors.",

    "summary": "Daring predictions of the proximate future can establish shared discursive\nframeworks, mobilize capital, and steer complex processes. Among the prophetic\nvisions that encouraged and accompanied the development of new communication\ntechnologies was the \"Digital Earth,\" described in a 1998 speech by Al Gore as\na high-resolution representation of the planet to share and analyze detailed\ninformation about its state. This article traces a genealogy of the Digital\nEarth as a techno-scientific myth, locating it in a constellation of media\nfutures, arguing that a common subtext of these envisionments consists of a\ndream of wholeness, an afflatus to overcome perceived fragmentation among\nhumans, and between humans and the Earth.",

    "publish": "2014-12-06T15:49:02Z", 
    "summary": "Location and mobility patterns of individuals are important to environmental\nplanning, societal resilience, public health, and a host of commercial\napplications. Mining telecommunication traffic and transactions data for such\npurposes is controversial, in particular raising issues of privacy. However,\nour hypothesis is that privacy-sensitive uses are possible and often beneficial\nenough to warrant considerable research and development efforts. Our work\ncontends that peoples behavior can yield patterns of both significant\ncommercial, and research, value. For such purposes, methods and algorithms for\nmining telecommunication data to extract commonly used routes and locations,\narticulated through time-geographical constructs, are described in a case study\nwithin the area of transportation planning and analysis. From the outset, these\nwere designed to balance the privacy of subscribers and the added value of\nmobility patterns derived from their mobile communication traffic and\ntransactions data. Our work directly contrasts the current, commonly held\nnotion that value can only be added to services by directly monitoring the\nbehavior of individuals, such as in current attempts at location-based\nservices. We position our work within relevant legal frameworks for privacy and\ndata protection, and show that our methods comply with such requirements and\nalso follow best-practices",

    "summary": "Cloud computing in eHealth is an emerging area for only few years. There\nneeds to identify the state of the art and pinpoint challenges and possible\ndirections for researchers and applications developers. Based on this need, we\nhave conducted a systematic review of cloud computing in eHealth. We searched\nACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Inspec, ISI Web of Science and Springer as\nwell as relevant open-access journals for relevant articles. A total of 237\nstudies were first searched, of which 44 papers met the Include Criteria. The\nstudies identified three types of studied areas about cloud computing in\neHealth, namely (1) cloud-based eHealth framework design (n=13); (2)\napplications of cloud computing (n=17); and (3) security or privacy control\nmechanisms of healthcare data in the cloud (n=14). Most of the studies in the\nreview were about designs and concept-proof. Only very few studies have\nevaluated their research in the real world, which may indicate that the\napplication of cloud computing in eHealth is still very immature. However, our\npresented review could pinpoint that a hybrid cloud platform with mixed access\ncontrol and security protection mechanisms will be a main research area for\ndeveloping citizen centred home-based healthcare applications.",

    "summary": "In open collaborative projects like Wikipedia, interactions among users can\nproduce tension and misunderstandings. Complex disputes require more\nsophisticated mechanisms of conflict resolution. In this paper, we examine the\ncase of the Spanish Wikipedia and its Arbitration Committee, known as CRC, over\nits two years of activity. We postulate that the high percentage of rejections\nof cases presented by non-administrators, the lack of diversity inside the\ncommittee (composed only by administrators), and the high number of cases\ninvolving administrators played a central role in its eventual downfall. We\nconclude that mechanisms that fail to acknowledge the ecosystem they are part\nof cannot succceed.

    "summary": "The controllability of a factory is highly dependent on the capability of a\ngiven enterprise planning system to interact with the shop floor, and the\ncapability of any authorized user to review the operation plans, as well as the\nstatus of any sales order on the shop floor. We have called the concept\nE-manufacturing, which is a concept to improve the controllability of a factory\nby connecting the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to the shop floor\ncontrol (SFC) system through the Internet. Business systems and plant systems\nmust be coupled to reduce decision cycle times and increase plant productivity,\nas well as eliminating human intervention to improve accuracy and data\navailability speed. This paper is the output of a project funded by the\nEgyptian Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology, through the Electronic\nResearch Institute. The overall objective of the ministerial program is\nbridging the gap between R&D and manufacturing to fulfill the immediate\ntechnological needs of the Egyptian industry and economy, and building a\nnational technology know-how expertise. This is achieved, in this project, by\naddressing the development of an E-Manufacturing system using available RFID\nstate-of-the-art technology. The specific objective is developing an end\nproduct for Egyptian industry that manages real-time interaction with back end\nERP systems to correct delays on the shop floor, improving real-time operation,\nreducing cost, and allow real-time visibility, through the intelligent usage of\nthe RFID.The end product is a fully working system tested in the factory of the\nmanufacturing partner MOBICA. This report addresses the logical and technical\nstructure,as well as the technology constraints that should be considered in\nsuch systems, and the implementation stages of the project",

    "publish": "2014-12-22T12:55:48Z", 
    "summary": "Human and artificial organizations may be described as networks of\ninteracting parts. Those parts exchange data and control information and, as a\nresult of these interactions, organizations produce emergent behaviors and\npurposes -- traits the characterize \"the whole\" as \"greater than the sum of its\nparts\". In this chapter it is argued that, rather than a static and immutable\nproperty, emergence should be interpreted as the result of dynamic interactions\nbetween forces of opposite sign: centripetal (positive) forces strengthening\nemergence by consolidating the whole and centrifugal (negative) forces that\nweaken the social persona and as such are detrimental to emergence. The result\nof this interaction is called in this chapter as \"quality of emergence\". This\nproblem is discussed in the context of a particular class of organizations:\nconventional hierarchies. We highlight how traditional designs produce\nbehaviors that may severely impact the quality of emergence. Finally we discuss\na particular class of organizations that do not suffer from the limitations\ntypical of strict hierarchies and result in greater quality of emergence. In\nsome case, however, these enhancements are counterweighted by a reduced degree\nof controllability and verifiability.",

    "summary": "The Multi Agent Based programming, modeling and simulation environment of\nNetLogo has been used extensively during the last fifteen years for educational\namong other purposes. The learning subject, upon interacting with the Users\nInterface of NetLogo, can easily study properties of the simulated natural\nsystems, as well as observe the latters response, when altering their\nparameters. In this research, NetLogo was used under the perspective that the\nlearning subject (student or prospective teacher)interacts with the model in a\ndeeper way, obtaining the role of an agent. This is not achieved by obliging\nthe learner to program (write NetLogo code) but by interviewing them, together\nwith applying the choices that they make on the model. The scheme was carried\nout, as part of a broader research, with interviews, and web page like\ninterface menu selections, in a sample of 17 University students in Athens\n(prospective Primary School teachers) and the results were judged as\nencouraging. At a further stage, the computers were set as a network, where all\nthe agents performed together. In this way the learners could watch onscreen\nthe overall outcome of their choices and actions on the modeled ecosystem. This\nseems to open a new, small, area of research in NetLogo educational\napplications.",

    "summary": "Electricity market mechanisms designed to steer sustainable generation of\nelectricity play an important role for the energy transition intended to\nmitigate climate change. One of the major problems is to complement volatile\nrenewable energy sources by operationally flexible capacity reserves. In this\npaper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets taking\ninto account the operational flexibility of power plants, such that the costs\nof long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spot\nmarkets. For this purpose, a measure of operational flexibility is introduced\nenabling to compute an inflexibility fee charging each individual power plant\non a wholesale electricity spot market. The total sum of inflexibility fees\naccumulated on the spot markets then can be used to finance a capacity market\nkeeping the necessary reserves to warrant grid reliability. Here each reserve\npower plant then gets a reliability payment depending on its operational\nflexibility. The proposal is applied to a small exemplary grid, illustrating\nits main idea and also revealing the caveat that too high fees paradoxically\ncould create incentives to employ highly flexible power plants on the spot\nmarket rather than to run them as backup capacity.",

The evaluation is thus more\nfocused on how ready and usable these platforms are for IoT ecosystem players,\nrather than on the peculiarities of the underlying technological layers.

    "summary": "Teachable Agent (TA) is a special type of pedagogical agent which\ninstantiates the educational theory of Learning by Teaching. Soon after its\nemergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over\nscaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students\nto take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA\ndesign also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions\nwith students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of\nbelievability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive\nlearning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,\nAffective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and\nimplement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with\nstudents with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of\npedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory\nto design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors\nof students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to\nlearn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and\nAffectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage\nthem to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can\ninteract with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the\nagent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an\neducator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent\ncan perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators\ninto the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system,\nwhich can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a\nnatural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.",

    "summary": "Current outdoor localization techniques fail to provide the required accuracy\nfor estimating the car's lane. In this paper, we present LaneQuest: a system\nthat leverages the ubiquitous and low-energy inertial sensors available in\ncommodity smart-phones to provide an accurate estimate of the car's current\nlane. LaneQuest leverages hints from the phone sensors about the surrounding\nenvironment to detect the car's lane. For example, a car making a right turn\nmost probably will be in the right-most lane, a car passing by a pothole will\nbe in a specific lane, and the car's angular velocity when driving through a\ncurve reflects its lane. Our investigation shows that there are amble\nopportunities in the environment, i.e. lane \"anchors\", that provide cues about\nthe car's lane. To handle the ambiguous location, sensors noise, and fuzzy lane\nanchors; LaneQuest employs a novel probabilistic lane estimation algorithm.\nFurthermore, it uses an unsupervised crowd-sourcing approach to learn the\nposition and lane-span distribution of the different lane-level anchors.\n  Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices and\n260Km driving traces by 13 drivers in different cities shows that LaneQuest can\ndetect the different lane-level anchors with an average precision and recall of\nmore than 90%. This leads to an accurate detection of the exact car's lane\nposition 80% of the time, increasing to 89% of the time to within one lane.\nThis comes with a low-energy footprint, allowing LaneQuest to be implemented on\nthe energy-constrained mobile devices.",

Activity based models, which have been\ngaining popularity in recent years, are built from a large number of observed\ntrips and their purposes. However, data acquired through traditional\ninterview-based travel surveys lack the accuracy and quantity required by such\nmodels. Smartphones and interactive web interfaces have emerged as an\nattractive alternative to conventional travel surveys. A smartphone-based\ntravel survey, Future Mobility Survey (FMS), was developed and field-tested in\nSingapore and collected travel data from more than 1000 participants for\nmultiple days. To provide a more intelligent interface, inferring the\nactivities of a user at a certain location is a crucial challenge. This paper\npresents a learning model that infers the most likely activity associated to a\ncertain visited place. The data collected in FMS contain errors or noise due to\nvarious reasons, so a robust approach via ensemble learning is used to improve\ngeneralization performance.

    "summary": "Using time series of US patents per million inhabitants, knowledge-generating\ncycles can be distinguished. These cycles partly coincide with Kondratieff long\nwaves. The changes in the slopes between them indicate discontinuities in the\nknowledge-generating paradigms. The knowledge-generating paradigms can be\nmodeled in terms of interacting dimensions (for example, in\nuniversity-industry-government relations) that set limits to the maximal\nefficiency of innovation systems. The maximum values of the parameters in the\nmodel are of the same order as the regression coefficients of the empirical\nwaves. The mechanism of the increase in the dimensionality is specified as\nself-organization which leads to the breaking of existing relations into the\nmore diversified structure of a fractal-like network. This breaking can be\nmodeled in analogy to 2D and 3D (Koch) snowflakes. The boost of knowledge\ngeneration leads to newly emerging technologies that can be expected to be more\ndiversified and show shorter life cycles than before. Time spans of the\nknowledge-generating cycles can also be analyzed in terms of Fibonacci numbers.\nThis perspective allows for forecasting expected dates of future possible\nparadigm changes.

    "publish": "2015-02-22T14:22:41Z", 
    "summary": "Sales pipeline analysis is fundamental to proactive management of an\nenterprize's sales pipeline and critical for business success. In particular,\nwin propensity prediction, which involves quantitatively estimating the\nlikelihood that on-going sales opportunities will be won within a specified\ntime window, is a fundamental building block for sales management and lays the\nfoundation for many applications such as resource optimization and sales gap\nanalysis. With the proliferation of big data, the use of data-driven predictive\nmodels as a means to drive better sales performance is increasingly widespread,\nboth in business-to-client (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets.\nHowever, the relatively small number of B2B transactions (compared with the\nvolume of B2C transactions), noisy data, and the fast-changing market\nenvironment pose challenges to effective predictive modeling. This paper\nproposes a machine learning-based unified framework for sales opportunity win\npropensity prediction, aimed at addressing these challenges. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our proposed system using data from a top-500 enterprize in the\nbusiness-to-business market.",

    "publish": "2015-02-23T22:04:29Z", 
    "summary": "The development of technologies of multimedia, linked to that of Internet and\ndemocratization of high speed, has made henceforth E-learning possible for\nlearners being in virtual classes and geographically distributed. One benefit\nto taking course online is that the online course structure is typically more\nstudent focused than teacher centered and encouraging more active participation\nby students in collaborative learning activities. The quality and quantity of\nasynchronous and synchronous communications are the key elements for E-learning\nsuccess. A potential problem that has received little exploration is student's\nfeeling of isolation. It is important to have a propitious supervision to\nbreaking down learner feeling isolation in E learning environment. This feeling\nof isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of dropout in\nE-learning. It impacts on their levels of participation, satisfaction and\nlearning. To overcome this feeling of isolation, we aim, by this research, to\nprovide the trainer and each learner with an environment allowing them to\nbehave as if being face to face; in other words, to approach the pedagogy of\nclassroom teaching. Our contribution to reduce the feeling of isolation is to\nensure the presence of the teacher in the educational tools. These tools aim to\nestablish a real dialogue with the learner, forcing him to take an active part\nin their learning. Among the tools we offer, video conference Openmeeting\nintegrated in Moodle providing the possibility of using the notion of class and\nwhiteboard, the indicator of motivation quantification tool based hand gesture\nthat we developed and finally social networks web 2. 0 like Facebook, youtube,\ntwitter to promote collaboration, sharing and communication of the learner with\nhis peers.",

    "publish": "2015-02-24T09:11:19Z", 
    "summary": "The phenomenal success of certain crowdsourced online platforms, such as\nWikipedia, is accredited to their ability to tap the crowd's potential to\ncollaboratively build knowledge. While it is well known that the crowd's\ncollective wisdom surpasses the cumulative individual expertise, little is\nunderstood on the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced environment.\nA proper understanding of the dynamics of knowledge building in a crowdsourced\nenvironment would enable one in the better designing of such environments to\nsolicit knowledge from the crowd. Our experiment on crowdsourced systems based\non annotations shows that an important reason for the rapid knowledge building\nin such environments is due to variance in expertise. First, we used as our\ntest bed, a customized Crowdsourced Annotation System (CAS) which provides a\ngroup of users the facility to annotate a given document while trying to\nunderstand it. Our results showed the presence of different genres of\nproficiency amongst the users of an annotation system. We observed that the\necosystem in crowdsourced annotation system comprised of mainly four categories\nof contributors, namely: Probers, Solvers, Articulators and Explorers. We\ninferred from our experiment that the knowledge garnering mainly happens due to\nthe synergetic interaction across these categories. Further, we conducted an\nanalysis on the dataset of Wikipedia and Stack Overflow and noticed the\necosystem presence in these portals as well. From this study, we claim that the\necosystem is a universal characteristic of all crowdsourced portals.",

    "publish": "2015-02-12T19:19:41Z", 
    "summary": "Renewable energy systems are an increasingly popular way to generate\nelectricity around the world. As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to\nsupplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new\nchallenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized\npower generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring\ntechnologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data\nanalysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data\npertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power\nsources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation\nof intelligent grid infrastructure. However, the application space of remote\nmonitoring extends well beyond this. This paper details the development and\nimplementation of an open-source monitoring framework for remote solar energy\nsystems. The necessity for such a framework to be open is much better\nunderstood when considered through the lens of the theoretical potential for\nremote monitoring technologies in developing countries. The United States and\nother industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be\nslow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment\nand infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing\nelectrical grid. In countries where grid infrastructure is generally inadequate\nor nonexistent, this barrier is far less of a concern, and renewable energy\ntechnologies are viewed more as an enabling tool for progress than as a\ndisruptive and expensive technological tangent. In this context as well, remote\nmonitoring has a role to play.",

Motivated by the obesity epidemic in the\nUnited States, our aim is three-fold: (i) to assess the relationship between\nfast food and chain restaurants and obesity, (ii) to better understand people's\nthoughts on and perceptions of their daily dining experiences, and (iii) to\nreveal the nature of social reinforcement and approval in the context of\ndietary health on social media. When we correlate the prominence of fast food\nrestaurants in US counties with obesity, we find the Foursquare data to show a\ngreater correlation at 0.424 than official survey data from the County Health\nRankings would show. Our analysis further reveals a relationship between small\nbusinesses and local foods with better dietary health, with such restaurants\ngetting more attention in areas of lower obesity. However, even in such areas,\nsocial approval favors the unhealthy foods high in sugar, with donut shops\nproducing the most liked photos. Thus, the dietary landscape our study reveals\nis a complex ecosystem, with fast food playing a role alongside social\ninteractions and personal perceptions, which often may be at odds.",

It\nis generally acknowledged that any educational environment is highly dependent\nupon a wide range of resources or variables such as teaching staff, research\nand study areas, meeting and accommodation facilities, library services,\nrestaurant and leisure facilities, etc. The system we have devised using ICT\nand RFID technologies supports not only authentic transactions among all\nuniversity departments, but also interconnects all levels of academic life and\nactivity. Thus, the utility of the system ranges from access control (student/\nstaff/ visitor identification), attendance tracking, library check-out services\nand voting to grade book consulting, inventory, cashless vending, parking,\nlaundry and copying services. Physically, the system consists of several RFID\ngates/readers, a data server and some network stations, all of them requiring\nspecific structuring and integration solutions. The system is quite different\nfrom already existing ones in that it proposes an innovative access solution.\nThus, the search of the ID card holder in a database has been replaced by local\nprocessing. Since one and the same card is employed to perform a variety of\noperations, the system has immediate and numerous utilizations.",

E-learning deliver hypertext, text, audio,\nimages, animation and videos using desktop standalone computer, local area\nnetwork based intranet and internet based contents. While producing an\ne-learning content or course-ware, a major decision making factor is whether to\nuse audio for the benefit of the end users. Generally, three types of audio can\nbe used in e-learning: narration, music and sound effect. This paper shows that\nthe use of proper audio based on contents type and subject can make the content\nmore interesting as well as help the end users to better understand the\ncontents.",

The study was conducted\nusing qualitative approach interviewing 16 retailers in Saudi Arabia. It comes\nup with 22 factors that are believed the most influencing factors for retailers\nin Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, there seem to be differences between retailers\nin companies at different maturity stages in terms of having different\nattitudes regarding the issues of using e-commerce. The businesses that have\nreached a high stage of e-commerce maturity provide practical evidence of\npositive and optimistic attitudes and practices regarding use of e-commerce,\nwhereas the businesses that have not reached higher levels of maturity provide\npractical evidence of more negative and pessimistic attitudes and practices.\nThe study, therefore, should contribute to efforts leading to greater\ne-commerce development in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar\ncontext.",

    "summary": "Advances in sensing and computing capabilities are making it possible to\nembed increasing computing power in small devices. This has enabled the sensing\ndevices not just to passively capture data at very high resolution but also to\ntake sophisticated actions in response. Combined with advances in\ncommunication, this is resulting in an ecosystem of highly interconnected\ndevices referred to as the Internet of Things - IoT. In conjunction, the\nadvances in machine learning have allowed building models on this ever\nincreasing amounts of data. Consequently, devices all the way from heavy assets\nsuch as aircraft engines to wearables such as health monitors can all now not\nonly generate massive amounts of data but can draw back on aggregate analytics\nto \"improve\" their performance over time. Big data analytics has been\nidentified as a key enabler for the IoT. In this chapter, we discuss various\navenues of the IoT where big data analytics either is already making a\nsignificant impact or is on the cusp of doing so. We also discuss social\nimplications and areas of concern.",

    "summary": "The process of electronic approach to writing and sending medical\nprescription promises to improve patient safety, health outcomes, maintaining\npatients privacy, promoting clinician acceptance and prescription security when\ncompared with the customary paper method. Traditionally, medical prescriptions\nare typically handwritten or printed on paper and hand-delivered to\npharmacists. Paper-based medical prescriptions are generating major concerns as\nthe incidences of prescription errors have been increasing and causing minor to\nserious problems to patients, including deaths. In this paper, intelligent\neprescription model that comprises a knowledge base of drug details and an\ninference engine that can help in decision making when writing a prescription\nwas developed. The research implements the e-prescription model with\nmultifactor authentication techniques which comprises password and biometric\ntechnology. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, using C-Sharp programming language,\nand Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database were employed in developing the systems\nfront end and back end respectively. This work implements a knowledge base to\nthe e-prescription system which has added intelligence for validating doctors\nprescription and also added security feature to the e-prescription system.",

    "summary": "Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our daily life. Their\nimproved sensing and computing capabilities bring new opportunities for human\nbehavior monitoring and analysis. Most work so far has been focused on\ndetecting correlation rather than causation among features extracted from\nsmartphone data. However, pure correlation analysis does not offer sufficient\nunderstanding of human behavior. Moreover, causation analysis could allow\nscientists to identify factors that have a causal effect on health and\nwell-being issues, such as obesity, stress, depression and so on and suggest\nactions to deal with them. Finally, detecting causal relationships in this kind\nof observational data is challenging since, in general, subjects cannot be\nrandomly exposed to an event.\n  In this article, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of a\ngeneric quasi-experimental framework for conducting causation studies on human\nbehavior from smartphone data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nby investigating the causal impact of several factors such as exercise, social\ninteractions and work on stress level. Our results indicate that exercising and\nspending time outside home and working environment have a positive effect on\nparticipants stress level while reduced working hours only slightly impact\nstress.",

The major aim of this research paper is to find out how\ninnovative information systems were marketed in the decade from 1980 to 1990.\nThe paper uses a double-step content analysis and does not focus on one method\nof content analysis only. The reason for choosing this approach is to combine\nthe advantages of both quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The\nresults of the quantitative content analysis indicated that the focus of the\nmarketing material would be on information management / information supply. But\nthe qualitative analysis revealed that the focus is on monetary advantages. The\nstrong focus on monetary advantages of information technology seems typical for\nthe 1980s and 1990s.

    "summary": "We describe an exploratory study on the use of markers set during a\nsynchronous collaborative interaction (reflection-in-action) for later\nconstruction of reflection reports upon the collaboration that occurred\n(reflection-on-action). During two sessions, pairs of students used the Visu\nvideoconferencing tool for synchronous interaction and marker setting\n(positive, negative or free) and then individual report building on the\ninteraction (using markers or not). A quantitative descriptive analysis was\nconducted on the markers put in action, on their use to reflect on action and\non the reflection categories of the sentences in these reports. Results show\nthat the students (1) used the markers equally as a note-taking and reflection\nmeans during the interaction, (2) used mainly positive markers both to reflect\nin and on action; (3) paid more attention in identifying what worked in their\ninteraction (conservative direction) rather than in planning on how to improve\ntheir group work (progressive direction); (4) used mainly their own markers to\nreflect on action, with an increase in the use of their partners's markers in\nthe second reflection reports; (5) reflected mainly on their partner in the\nfirst reflection reports and more on themselves in the second reports to\njustify themselves and to express their satisfaction.",

    "summary": "Regional development classification is one way to look at differences in\nlevels of development outcomes. Some frequently used methods are the shift\nshare, Gain index, the Iindex Williamson and Klassen typology. The development\nof science in the field of data mining, offers a new way for regional\ndevelopment data classification. This study discusses how the decision tree is\nused to classify the level of development based on indicators of regional gross\ndomestic product (GDP). GDP Data Central Java and Banten used in this study.\nBefore the data is entered into the decision tree forming algorithm, both the\nprovincial GDP data are classified using Klassen typology. Three decision tree\nalgorithms, namely J48, NBTRee and REPTree tested in this study using\ncross-validation evaluation, then selected one of the best performing\nalgorithms. The results show that the J48 has a better accuracy rate which is\nequal to 85.18% compared to the algorithm NBTRee and REPTree. Testing the model\nis done to the six districts / municipalities in the province of Banten, and\nshows that there are two districts / cities are still at the development of the\nstatus quadrant relatively underdeveloped regions, namely Kota Tangerang and\nKabupaten Tangerang. As for the Central Java Province, Kendal, Magelang,\nPemalang, Rembang, Semarang and Wonosobo are an area with a quadrant of\ndevelopment also on the status of the region is relatively underdeveloped.\nClassification model that has been developed is able to classify the level of\ndevelopment fast and easy to enter data directly into the decision tree is\nformed. This study can be used as an alternative decision support for policy\nmakers in order to determine the future direction of development.",

    "summary": "Computer programming was once thought of as a skill required only by\nprofessional software developers. But today, given the ubiquitous nature of\ncomputation and data science it is quickly becoming necessary for all\nscientists and engineers to have at least a basic knowledge of how to program.\nTeaching how to program, particularly to those students with little or no\ncomputing background, is well-known to be a difficult task. However, there is\nalso a wealth of evidence-based teaching practices for teaching programming\nskills which can be applied to greatly improve learning outcomes and the\nstudent experience. Adopting these practices naturally gives rise to greater\nlearning efficiency - this is critical if programming is to be integrated into\nan already busy geoscience curriculum. This paper considers an undergraduate\ncomputer programming course, run during the last 5 years in the Department of\nEarth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. The teaching\nmethodologies that were used each year are discussed alongside the challenges\nthat were encountered, and how the methodologies affected student performance.\nAnonymised student marks and feedback are used to highlight this, and also how\nthe adjustments made to the course eventually resulted in a highly effective\nlearning environment.",

Can this data help us better\nunderstand, characterize and alleviate poverty in one of the poorest nations in\nthe world. Our study is an attempt in this direction. We discuss two concepts,\nwhich are both interconnected and immensely useful for securing the important\nlink between mobile accessibility and poverty.\n  First, we use the cellular-communications data to construct virtual\nconnectivity maps for Senegal, which are then correlated with the poverty\nindicators to learn a model. Our model predicts poverty index at any spatial\nresolution. Thus, we generate Poverty Maps for Senegal at an unprecedented\nfiner resolution. Such maps are essential for understanding what characterizes\npoverty in a certain region, and how it differentiates from other regions, for\ntargeted responses for the demographic of the population that is most needy. An\ninteresting fact, that is empirically proved by our methodology, is that a\nlarge portion of all communication, and economic activity in Senegal is\nconcentrated in Dakar, leaving many other regions marginalized.\n  Second, we study how user behavioral statistics, gathered from\ncellular-communications, correlate with the poverty indicators. Can this\nrelationship be learnt as a model to generate poverty maps at a finer\nresolution? Surprisingly, this relationship can give us an alternate poverty\nmap, that is solely based on the user behavior. Since poverty is a complex\nphenomenon, poverty maps showcasing multiple perspectives, such as ours,\nprovide policymakers with better insights for effective responses for poverty\neradication.",

    "summary": "Knowledge Management (KM) is an approach to achieving strategic objectives by\nvisualizing, sharing, and using intangible resources of an organization and its\nstakeholders. There are many studies that analyze specific factors for the\nsuccessful implementation of KM programs, and the evaluation of such factors is\nconsidered a strategic tool for Public Organizations (POs) for efficiently\ndirecting the implementation of a KM program. Nevertheless, there are cultural\nproblems such as weak trust, bad collaboration; technological problems as KM\nsystems difficult to use, nor interconnected or interoperable; and strategic\nproblems as political changes, not inter-administration continuity or lack of\npolitical willingness. In this research we provide an overview of the key\nfactors for facilitating the implementation of KM programs. To this end, we\nconducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of success factors to create a\nKM program for POs. Analyzing the twenty related studies we summarize benefits\nand quality attributes of KM. Moreover, we obtained from an ongoing project\nevaluation results of the KM factors ranked cultural, technological and\nstrategic. The results show that the Mexican POs have strategic and\ntechnological issues such as: a misalignment between knowledge management and\norganizational goals, it seems that POs are barely reusing their knowledge to\nexecute their daily activities or to take decisions, and is not possible to\nknow who and how a knowledge asset has been used. Finally, according to the\ngaps and difficulties of the SLR, we provide strategies to successfully\nimplement KM programs in Mexico.",

To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with\ninstitutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science\ncommunication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar\nwith the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject\nmatter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content\nanalysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several\nfactors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design\ntendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of\nmontage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to\nan increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of\ninstitutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed\namateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This\nstudy represents an important step in understanding the essence of current\npopular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a\nhelpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this\nkind of new media.",

    "publish": "2015-06-24T11:42:13Z", 
    "summary": "Nairobi is one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities and a major\nbusiness and technology powerhouse in Africa. However, Nairobi currently lacks\nmonitoring technologies to obtain reliable data on traffic and road\ninfrastructure conditions. In this paper, we investigate the use of mobile\ncrowdsourcing as means to gather and document Nairobi's road quality\ninformation. We first present the key findings of a city-wide road quality\nsurvey about the perception of existing road quality conditions in Nairobi.\nBased on the survey's findings, we then developed a mobile crowdsourcing\napplication, called CommuniSense, to collect road quality data. The application\nserves as a tool for users to locate, describe, and photograph road hazards. We\ntested our application through a two-week field study amongst 30 participants\nto document various forms of road hazards from different areas in Nairobi. To\nverify the authenticity of user-contributed reports from our field study, we\nproposed to use online crowdsourcing using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to\nverify whether submitted reports indeed depict road hazards. We found 92% of\nuser-submitted reports to match the MTurkers judgements. While our prototype\nwas designed and tested on a specific city, our methodology is applicable to\nother developing cities.",

Such sites, which we call \"Just Plain\nSites\" (JPSs) are likely to inadvertently represent greater privacy risks than\nhigh profile sites by virtue of being unable to afford privacy expertise. To\nassess the prevalence of the privacy risks to which JPSs may inadvertently be\nexposing their visitors, we analyzed a number of easily observed privacy\npractices of such sites. We found that many JPSs collect a great deal of\ninformation from their visitors, share a great deal of information about their\nvisitors with third parties, permit a great deal of tracking of their visitors,\nand use deprecated or unsafe security practices. Our goal in this work is not\nto scold JPS operators, but to raise awareness of these facts among both JPS\noperators and visitors, possibly encouraging the operators of such sites to\ntake greater care in their implementations, and visitors to take greater care\nin how, when, and what they share.",

As tremendous growth opportunities\nemerge, so do the challenges such as diverse devices spanning across multiple\nnetworks, the need to manage the exponential growth of sensor generated data\nand to make sense of the huge influx of data in meaningful ways. The multitude\nof diversity can best be addressed by fundamentally opening up systems,\narchitecture and applications.

    "summary": "The population of elderly people keeps increasing rapidly, which becomes a\npredominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and\ncost-effective need to be sought. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a new\napproach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient\nIntelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to\nconstruct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain\nindependent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL\nthat remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the\npower of human being, and the importance of social connections and social\nactivities is less noticed.

    "publish": "2015-07-31T13:24:55Z", 
    "summary": "While substantial effort has been devoted to understand fraudulent activity\nin traditional online advertising (search and banner), more recent forms such\nas video ads have received little attention. The understanding and\nidentification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for\nadvertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection\nmechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development\nof independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems\nare missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.\n  In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using\nour tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major\nonline video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system\nsignificantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation\nindicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we\nfind that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters\ndifferently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified\nas fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We\nspeculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to\ncompensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden\nof the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed.",

    "summary": "Digital maps have become a part of our daily life with a number of commercial\nand free map services. These services have still a huge potential for\nenhancement with rich semantic information to support a large class of mapping\napplications. In this paper, we present Map++, a system that leverages standard\ncell-phone sensors in a crowdsensing approach to automatically enrich digital\nmaps with different road semantics like tunnels, bumps, bridges, footbridges,\ncrosswalks, road capacity, among others. Our analysis shows that cell-phones\nsensors with humans in vehicles or walking get affected by the different road\nfeatures, which can be mined to extend the features of both free and commercial\nmapping services. We present the design and implementation of Map++ and\nevaluate it in a large city. Our evaluation shows that we can detect the\ndifferent semantics accurately with at most 3% false positive rate and 6% false\nnegative rate for both vehicle and pedestrian-based features. Moreover, we show\nthat Map++ has a small energy footprint on the cell-phones, highlighting its\npromise as a ubiquitous digital maps enriching service.",

    "summary": "Since the introduction of the Fortran programming language some 60 years ago,\nthere has been little progress in making error messages more user-friendly. A\nfirst step in this direction is to translate them into the natural language of\nthe students. In this paper we propose a simple script for Linux systems which\ngives word by word translations of error messages. It works for most\nprogramming languages and for all natural languages. Understanding the error\nmessages generated by compilers is a major hurdle for students who are learning\nprogramming, particularly for non-native English speakers. Not only may they\nnever become \"fluent\" in programming but many give up programming altogether.\nWhereas programming is a tool which can be useful in many human activities,\ne.g. history, genealogy, astronomy, entomology, in many countries the skill of\nprogramming remains confined to a narrow fringe of professional programmers. In\nall societies, besides professional violinists there are also amateurs. It\nshould be the same for programming. It is our hope that once translated and\nexplained the error messages will be seen by the students as an aid rather than\nas an obstacle and that in this way more students will enjoy learning and\npractising programming. They should see it as a funny game.",

    "summary": "We propose and implement a novel relative positioning system, WalkieLokie, to\nenable more kinds of Augmented Reality applications, e.g., virtual shopping\nguide, virtual business card sharing. WalkieLokie calculates the distance and\ndirection between an inquiring user and the corresponding target. It only\nrequires a dummy speaker binding to the target and broadcasting inaudible\nacoustic signals. Then the user walking around can obtain the position using a\nsmart device. The key insight is that when a user walks, the distance between\nthe smart device and the speaker changes; and the pattern of displacement\n(variance of distance) corresponds to the relative position. We use a\nsecond-order phase locked loop to track the displacement and further estimate\nthe position. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of our strategy, we\npropose a synchronization mechanism to synthesize all estimation results from\ndifferent timeslots. We show that the mean error of ranging and direction\nestimation is 0.63m and 2.46 degrees respectively, which is accurate even in\ncase of virtual business card sharing. Furthermore, in the shopping mall where\nthe environment is quite severe, we still achieve high accuracy of positioning\none dummy speaker, and the mean position error is 1.28m.",

Smart Card Data (SCD)\ncollected by the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems can reflect a general\nview of the mobility pattern of the whole bus and metro riders in urban area.\nSince the mobility and stability are temporally and spatially dynamic and\ntherefore difficult to measure, few work focuses on the transition of their\ntravel pattern between a long time interval. In this paper, an overview of the\nrelation between stability and regularity of public transit riders based on SCD\nof Beijing is presented first. To analyze the temporal travel pattern of urban\nresidents, travelers are classified into two categories, extreme and\nnon-extreme travelers. We have two lines for profiling all cardholders,\nrule-based approach for extreme and improved density-based clustering method\nfor non-extreme. Similar clusters are aggregated according their features of\nregularity and occasionality. By combining transition matrix of passenger's\ntemporal travel pattern and socioeconomic data of Beijing in the year of 2010\nand 2014, several analyses about resident's temporal mobility and stability are\npresented to shed lights on the interdependence between stability and mobility\nin the time dimension. The results indicate that passengers's regularity is\nhard to predict, extreme travel patterns are more vulnerable and overall\nnon-extreme travel patterns nearly stay the same.",

    "publish": "2015-08-27T16:33:52Z", 
    "summary": "Uber has recently been introducing novel practices in urban taxi transport.\nJourney prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary\ngeographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge\npricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open\ndatasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies\nthat emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more\ntransparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price\ncomparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover\nthat Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher\nfares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in\noccurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone\napplication, OpenStreetCab, that offers a personalized consultation to mobile\nusers on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months\nafter its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a\nsingle city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the\npotential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a\nhighlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per\ntaxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive\nexperiments to show how Uber's surge pricing is the driving factor of higher\njourney prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application's\nusers. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber's surge pricing is\noccurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction\ntask where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area's tendency to surge.\nUsing exogenous to Uber datasets we show how it is possible to estimate\ncustomer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high\naccuracy.",

Do they see it as an economic opportunity or a\nsecurity threat? In this paper, we answer this question by analyzing online\nnews reports about China published in Australia, France, Germany, Japan,\nRussia, South Korea, the UK and the US. More specifically, we first analyze the\nfrequency with which China has appeared in news headlines, which is a measure\nof China's influence in the world. Second, we build a Naive Bayes classifier to\nstudy the evolving nature of the news reports, i.e., whether they are economic\nor political. We then evaluate the friendliness of the news coverage based on\nsentiment analysis. Empirical results indicate that there has been increasing\nnews coverage of China in all the countries under study. We also find that the\nemphasis of the reports is generally shifting towards China's economy. Here\nJapan and South Korea are exceptions: they are reporting more on Chinese\npolitics. In terms of global sentiment, the picture is quite gloomy. With the\nexception of Australia and, to some extent, France, all the other countries\nunder examination are becoming less positive towards China.",

    "summary": "We describe a method of automatic feedback provision for students learning\nprogramming and computational methods in Python. We have implemented, used and\nrefined this system since 2009 for growing student numbers, and summarise the\ndesign and experience of using it. The core idea is to use a unit testing\nframework: the teacher creates a set of unit tests, and the student code is\ntested by running these tests. With our implementation, students typically\nsubmit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes\nafter submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is\nchosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very\nsignificantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a student's\nsolution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student\ncontact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced\nnature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning\napproach. Students can re-submit their work repeatedly and iteratively improve\ntheir solution, and enjoy using the system. We include an evaluation of the\nsystem and data from using it in a class of 425 students.",

    "summary": "Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport\nplanning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high\nquality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure\nand other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the\nright places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates\nthe need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'.\nFollowing a brief review of the policy and research context related to this\nquestion, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications\nof such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive\nplanning support system which was initially developed to explore and map\ncycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on\norigin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area,\ndesire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and\nfor scenario-based 'cycling futures'. Four scenarios are presented, including\n'Go Dutch' and 'Ebikes', which explore what would happen if English people\ncycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on\ncycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the\nnumber of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and\ncarbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level\nfor each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of\nadditional scenarios and its deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the\nPCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and\nraises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.",

    "summary": "The feasibility of using microcontrollers in real life applications is\nbecoming more widespread. These applications have grown from do-it-yourself\n(DIY) projects of computer enthusiasts or robotics projects to larger scale\nefforts and deployments. This project developed and deployed a prototype\napplication that allows the public to interact with features of a model and\nview videos from a first-person perspective on the train. Through testing the\nmicrocontrollers and their usage in a public setting, it was demonstrated that\ninteractive features could be implemented in model train exhibits, which are\nfeatured in traditional museum environments that lack technical infrastructure.\nSpecifically, the Arduino and Raspberry Pi provide the necessary linkages\nbetween the Internet and hardware, allowing for a greater interactive\nexperience for museum visitors. These results provide an important use-case\nscenario that cultural heritage institutions can utilize when implementing\nmicrocontrollers on a larger scale, for the purpose of increasing visitors\nexperience through greater interaction and engagement.",

We argue that, similar to customer rating systems found in banking\nsystems and many sharing economy apps (e.g., Uber and Airbnb), Quality of\nConsumption (QoC) should be introduced to capture different metrics about\nservice consumers. We show how the combination of QoS and QoC, dubbed QoX, can\nbe used by consumers and providers to improve the security and management of\ntheir infrastructure. In addition, we demonstrate how sharing information among\nother consumers and providers increase the value of QoX. To address the main\nchallenge with sharing information, namely sybil attacks and mis-information,\nwe describe how we can leverage cloud providers as vouching authorities to\nensure the integrity of information. We present initial results in prototyping\nthe appropriate abstractions and interfaces in a cloud environment, focusing on\nthe design impact on both service providers and consumers.",

However, the two core, non-functional\nrequirements were negated from the project due to lack of experience and strict\ntime constraints. This project aimed to investigate whether the application\nwould be more suited to a non-relational solution.\n  Method: The application was re-written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,\nExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), an open source, fully JavaScript stack and then\nperformance tests were carried out to compare the two applications. A\nscalability review was also conducted to assess the benefits and drawbacks of\neach technology in this aspect.\n  Results: The investigation proved that the non-relational solution was much\nmore efficient and performed faster. However, the choice of database was only a\nsmall part of the increase in efficiency and it was an all-round better design\nthat gave the new application its performance upper hand.\n  Conclusion: A proposal for a new application design is given that follows the\nmicroservice architecture used by companies such as Amazon and Netflix. The\napplication is to be split up into four parts; database, client application,\nserver application and content delivery network. These four, independently\nscalable and manageable services offer the greatest flexibility for future\ndevelopment at the low costs necessary for a start-up.",

    "publish": "2015-10-08T15:58:33Z", 
    "summary": "In a world where traditional notions of privacy are increasingly challenged\nby the myriad companies that collect and analyze our data, it is important that\ndecision-making entities are held accountable for unfair treatments arising\nfrom irresponsible data usage. Unfortunately, a lack of appropriate\nmethodologies and tools means that even identifying unfair or discriminatory\neffects can be a challenge in practice. We introduce the unwarranted\nassociations (UA) framework, a principled methodology for the discovery of\nunfair, discriminatory, or offensive user treatment in data-driven\napplications. The UA framework unifies and rationalizes a number of prior\nattempts at formalizing algorithmic fairness. It uniquely combines multiple\ninvestigative primitives and fairness metrics with broad applicability,\ngranular exploration of unfair treatment in user subgroups, and incorporation\nof natural notions of utility that may account for observed disparities. We\ninstantiate the UA framework in FairTest, the first comprehensive tool that\nhelps developers check data-driven applications for unfair user treatment. It\nenables scalable and statistically rigorous investigation of associations\nbetween application outcomes (such as prices or premiums) and sensitive user\nattributes (such as race or gender). Furthermore, FairTest provides debugging\ncapabilities that let programmers rule out potential confounders for observed\nunfair effects. We report on use of FairTest to investigate and in some cases\naddress disparate impact, offensive labeling, and uneven rates of algorithmic\nerror in four data-driven applications. As examples, our results reveal subtle\nbiases against older populations in the distribution of error in a predictive\nhealth application and offensive racial labeling in an image tagger.",

    "summary": "Map matching has been used to reduce the noisiness of the location estimates\nby aligning them to the road network on a digital map. A growing number of\napplications, e.g. energy-efficient localization and cellular provider side\nlocalization, depend on the availability of only sparse and coarse-grained\npositioning data; leading to a challenging map matching process.\n  In this paper, we present semMatch: a system that can provide accurate\nHMM-based map matching for challenging positioning traces. semMatch leverages\nthe smartphone's inertial sensors to detect different road semantics; such as\nspeed bumps, tunnels, and turns; and uses them in a mathe-matically-principled\nway as hints to overcome the sparse, noisy, and coarse-grained input\npositioning data, improving the HMM map matching accuracy and efficiency. To do\nthat, semMatch applies a series of preprocessing modules to handle the noisy\nlocations. The filtered location data is then processed by the core of semMatch\nsystem using a novel incremental HMM algorithm that combines a\nsemantics-enriched digital map and the car's ambient road semantics in its\nestimation process.\n  We have evaluated semMatch using traces collected from different cities\ncovering more than 150km under different harsh scenarios including\ncoarse-grained cellular-based positioning data, sparse GPS traces with\nextremely low sampling rate, and noisy traces with a large number of\nback-and-force transitions. The results show that semMatch significantly\noutperforms traditional map matching algorithms under all scenarios, with an\nenhancement of at least 416% and 894% in precision and recall respectively in\nthe most difficult cases. This highlights its promise as a next generation map\nmatching algorithm for challenging environments.",

    "summary": "In everyday life, the process of commuting to work from home happens every\nnow and then. And the research of commute characteristics is useful for urban\nfunction planning. For humans, the commute of an individual seems revealing no\nregular universal patterns, but it is true that people try to find a\nsatisfactory state of life regarding commute issues. Commute time and distance\nare most important indicators to measure the degree of this satisfaction.\nMarchetti states a certain regularity in human commute time distribution -\nspecifically, it states that no matter when, where and how far away people\nlive, they always tend to spend approximately the same average time for their\ndaily commute. However, will the rapid development of cities nowadays as well\nas serious challenges brought by economic development affect this constant? If\nthere are novel characteristics? We revisit these problems using fine grained\ncommunication data in two Chinese major cities during recent two years. The\nresults indicate that the commute time has been slightly increased from\nMarchetti's constant with the development of society. People's overall travel\nbudgets have been increased, more concretely speaking, for medium and long\ndistance commuters, their endurance limit for commute time is enhanced during\nthe passing years, and fluctuates around a constant; for short distance\ncommuters, their commute time increases with the distance. Moreover, the\npopulation distribution in every commute distance shows strong cross-city\nsimilarity and does not change much over two years.",

    "summary": "Big data is one of the most discussed, and possibly least understood, terms\nin use in business today. Big data is said to offer not only unprecedented\nlevels of business intelligence concerning the habits of consumers and rivals,\nbut also to herald a revolution in the way in which business are organized and\nrun. However, big data is not as straightforward as it might seem, particularly\nwhen it comes to the so-called dark data from social media. It is not simply\nthe quantity of data that has changed, it is also the speed and the variety of\nformats with which it is delivered. This article sets out to look at big data\nand debunk some of the myths that surround it. It focuses on the role of data\nfrom social media in particular and highlights two common myths about big data.\nThe first is that because a data set contains billions of items, traditional\nmethodological issues no longer matter. The second is the belief that big data\nis both a complete and unbiased source of data upon which to base decisions.",

    "summary": "Phishing is an online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information\nsuch as username, password and online banking details from its victims.\nPhishing education needs to be considered as a means to combat this threat.\nThis paper reports on a design and development of a mobile game prototype as an\neducational tool helping computer users to protect themselves against phishing\nattacks. The elements of a game design framework for avoiding phishing attacks\nwere used to address the game design issues. Game design principles served as\nguidelines for structuring and presenting information. Our mobile game design\naimed to enhance the users' avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect\nthemselves against phishing threats. A think-aloud study was conducted, along\nwith a pre- and post-test, to assess the game design framework though the\ndeveloped mobile game prototype. The study results showed a significant\nimprovement of participants' phishing avoidance behaviour in their post-test\nassessment. Furthermore, the study findings suggest that participants' threat\nperception, safeguard effectiveness, self-efficacy, perceived severity and\nperceived susceptibility elements positively impact threat avoidance behaviour,\nwhereas safeguard cost had a negative impact on it.",

    "summary": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder\nthat affects more that 6 million people worldwide. Motor dysfunction gradually\nincreases as the disease progress. It is usually mild in the early stages of\nthe disease but it relentlessly progresses to a severe or very severe\ndisability that is characterized by increasing degrees of bradykinesia,\nhypokinesia, muscle rigidity, loss of postural reflexes and balance control as\nwell as freezing of gait. In addition to a line of treatment based on\ndopaminergic PD-specific drugs, attending neurologists strongly recommend\nregular exercise combined with physiotherapy. However, the routine of\ntraditional rehabilitation often create boredom and loss of interest.\nOpportunities to liven up a daily exercise schedule may well take the form of\ncharacter-based virtual reality games which engage the player to physically\ntrain in a non-linear and looser fashion, providing an experience that varies\nfrom one game loop the next. Such \"exergames\", a word that results from the\namalgamation of the words \"exercise\" and \"game\" challenge patients into\nperforming movements of varying complexity in a playful and immersive virtual\nenvironment. In fact, today's game consoles using controllers like Nintendo's\nWii, Sony PlayStation Eye and the Microsoft Kinect sensor present new\nopportunities to infuse motivation and variety to an otherwise mundane\nphysiotherapy routine. But are these controllers and the games built for them\nappropriate for PD patients? In this paper we present some of these approaches\nand discuss their suitability for these patients mainly on the basis of demands\nmade on balance, agility and gesture precision.",

    "summary": "Social media have become a significant venue for information sharing of live\nupdates. Users of social media are producing and sharing large amount of\npersonal data as a part of the live updates. A significant percentage of this\ndata contains location information that can be used by other people for many\npurposes. Some of the social media users deliberately share their own location\ninformation with other social network users. However, a large number of social\nmedia users blindly or implicitly share their location without noticing it or\nits possible consequences. Implicit location sharing is investigated in the\ncurrent paper. We perform a large scale study on implicit location sharing for\none of the most popular social media platform, namely Twitter. After a careful\nstudy, we built a dataset of Turkish tweets and manually tagged them. Using\nmachine learning techniques we built classifiers that are able to classify\nwhether a given tweet contains implicit location sharing or not. The\nclassifiers are shown to be very accurate and efficient. Moreover, the best\nclassifier is employed as a browser add-on tool which warns the user whenever\nan implicit location sharing is predicted from to be released tweet. The paper\nprovides the methodology and the technical analysis as well. Furthermore, it\ndiscusses how these techniques can be extended to different social network\nservices and also to different languages.",

    "publish": "2015-12-02T17:57:13Z", 
    "summary": "This work discusses an important issue in the area of human resource\nmanagement by proposing a novel model for creation and evaluation of software\nteams. The model consists of several assessments, including a technical test, a\nquality of life test and a psychological-sociological test. Since the technical\ntest requires particular organizational specifications and cannot be examined\nwithout reference to a specific company, only the sociological test and the\nquality of life tests are extensively discussed in this work. Two strategies\nare discussed for assigning roles in a project. Initially, six software\nprojects were selected, and after extensive analysis of the projects, two\nprojects were chosen and correctives actions were applied. An empirical\nevaluation was also conducted to assess the model effectiveness. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the application of the model improved the\nproductivity of project teams.",

    "summary": "The development of information technology and Internet has led to rapidly\nprogressed in e-commerce and online shopping, due to the convenience that they\nprovide consumers. E-commerce and online shopping are still not able to fully\nreplace onsite shopping. In contrast, conventional online shopping websites\noften cannot provide enough information about a product for the customer to\nmake an informed decision before checkout. 3D virtual shopping environment show\ngreat potential for enhancing e-commerce systems and provide customers\ninformation about a product and real shopping environment. This paper presents\na new type of e-commerce system, which obviously brings virtual environment\nonline with an active 3D model that allows consumers to access products into\nreal physical environments for user interaction. Such system with easy process\ncan helps customers make better purchasing decisions that allows users to\nmanipulate 3D virtual models online. The stores participate in the 3D virtual\nmall by communicating with a mall management. The 3D virtual mall allows\nshoppers to perform actions across multiple stores simultaneously such as\nviewing product availability. The mall management can authenticate clients on\nall stores participating in the 3D virtual mall while only requiring clients to\nprovide authentication information once. 3D virtual shopping online mall\nconvenient and easy process allow consumers directly buy goods or services from\na seller in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. The\nvirtual mall with an active 3D model is implemented by using 3D Language (VRML)\nand asp.net as the script language for shopping online pages",

Here we test this hypothesis by looking at data on\nhistorical characters, and their occupations, as a proxy for the amount and\ntype of information we now remember from each historical period. We find that\nchanges in communication technologies, including the introduction of printing\nand the maturity of shorter forms of printed media-such as newspapers,\njournals, and pamphlets-were accompanied by sharp increases in the number of\nmemorable biographies from a time period that are present in current online and\noffline sources. Moreover, we find that changes in media technology, such as\nthe introduction of printing, film, radio, and television, coincide with sharp\nshifts in the occupations associated with the individuals present in both of\nthese biographical records. These findings suggest that communication\ntechnologies shape our species historical records by constraining the amount\nand types of information we can record.",

    "summary": "The literature on well being measurement seems to suggest that \"asking\" for a\nself-evaluation is the only way to estimate a complete and reliable measure of\nwell being. At the same time \"not asking\" is the only way to avoid biased\nevaluations due to self-reporting. Here we propose a method for estimating the\nwelfare perception of a community simply \"listening\" to the conversations on\nSocial Network Sites. The Social Well Being Index (SWBI) and its components are\nproposed through to an innovative technique of supervised sentiment analysis\ncalled iSA which scales to any language and big data. As main methodological\nadvantages, this approach can estimate several aspects of social well being\ndirectly from self-declared perceptions, instead of approximating it through\nobjective (but partial) quantitative variables like GDP; moreover\nself-perceptions of welfare are spontaneous and not obtained as answers to\nexplicit questions that are proved to bias the result.

The present article has\nas its primary objective the analysis of the presence of these courses and the\nrole that they represent in teacher training, and their knowledge and influence\non the future teachers that are currently being formed at university level. A\ncase study has been carried out with descriptive not experimental methodology,\nfrom a quantitative base. The sample study has been undertaken in Spain\n(n=200). Its main result being the determination of the minimal impact that the\nMOOC phenomenon has had on the students polled.

    "summary": "Really Simple Syndication (RSS) offers a means for university students to\nreceive timely updates from virtual learning environments. However, despite its\nutility, only 21% of students surveyed at a Lebanese university claim to have\never used the technology. To investigate whether a cultural influence is\naffecting intention to use RSS, the survey was extended to the British context\nto conduct a cross-cultural comparison. Using the Technology Adoption Model\n(TAM) as a research framework, 437 students responded to a questionnaire\ncontaining four constructs: intention to use (INT); attitude towards benefit\n(ATT); perceived usefulness (PU); and perceived ease of use (PEOU). Principle\ncomponents analysis (PCA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to\nexplore the psychometric qualities of the scale. The results show that adoption\nwas significantly higher, but also modest, in the British context at 36%.\nConfigural and metric invariance were fully supported, while scalar and\nfactorial invariance were partially supported. Analysis reveals that, as a\npotential consequence of culture, there are significant differences between PU\nand PEOU across the two contexts studied, potentially as a consequence of\nculture. It is recommended that faculty demonstrate to students how RSS can be\nused effectively in order to increase awareness and emphasise usefulness.",

Methods: We have developed HopkinsPD, a novel smartphone-based\nmonitoring platform, which measures symptoms actively (i.e. data are collected\nwhen a suite of tests is initiated by the individual at specific times during\nthe day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the\nbackground). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of\nfive key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,\nand reaction time. A random forest classifier is used to discriminate\nmeasurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the\nmedication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring\nwas established using HopkinsPD in July, 2014. This study used entirely remote,\nonline recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective\nscalability. In six months, 226 individuals (121 PD and 105 controls)\ncontributed over 46,000 hours of passive monitoring data and approximately\n8,000 instances of structured tests of voice, balance, gait, reaction, and\ndexterity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have\ncollected data at such a scale for remote PD monitoring. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the initial ability to discriminate treatment from baseline with\n71.0(+-0.4)% accuracy, which suggests medication response can be monitored\nremotely via smartphone-based measures.",

    "publish": "2016-01-18T22:11:29Z", 
    "summary": "There is often a fundamental mismatch between programmable privacy\nframeworks, on the one hand, and the ever shifting privacy expectations of\ncomputer system users, on the other hand. Based on the theory of contextual\nintegrity (CI), our paper addresses this problem by proposing a privacy\nframework that translates users' privacy expectations (norms) into a set of\nactionable privacy rules that are rooted in the language of CI. These norms are\nthen encoded using Datalog logic specification to develop an information system\nthat is able to verify whether information flows are appropriate and the\nprivacy of users thus preserved. A particular benefit of our framework is that\nit can automatically adapt as users' privacy expectations evolve over time.\n  To evaluate our proposed framework, we conducted an extensive survey\ninvolving more than 450 participants and 1400 questions to derive a set of\nprivacy norms in the educational context. Based on the crowdsourced responses,\nwe demonstrate that our framework can derive a compact Datalog encoding of the\nprivacy norms which can in principle be directly used for enforcing privacy of\ninformation flows within this context. In addition, our framework can\nautomatically detect logical inconsistencies between individual users' privacy\nexpectations and the derived privacy logic.",

    "summary": "Ameliorating elderly engagement is vital in rejuvenating independent living.\nHowever, recommended practices lack realization of personal traits despite\nsocio -economic promise. The recent proliferation of IoT with the advent of\nsmart-objects/things and personalized services pave the way for context-aware\nservice management. Eventually, the major goal of this paper is to develop a\ncontext-aware model in predicting engagement of elderly care. Hence, key\nrequirements are identified for elderly engagement, namely (a) discovery of\ncontexts, which are relevant (b) scaling up (over time) of engagement. However,\nparamount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as,\nun-observability, independence and composite relationship of contexts.\nTherefore, a Topic-model based model is proposed to address scalability of\ncontexts and its conjugal relationship with engagement. Eventually, systematic\nframework is demonstrated, which pinpoints key goals of context-aware services\nby participants' opinions, usage and feed-back.",

    "publish": "2016-01-24T11:51:45Z", 
    "summary": "Wine counterfeiting is not a new problem, however, the situation in China has\nbeen going worse even after Hong Kong manifested itself as a wine trading and\ndistribution center with abolishing all taxes on wine in 2008. The most basic\nmethod, printing a fake label with a subtly misspelled brand name or a slightly\ndifferent logo in hopes of fooling wine consumers, has been common to other\nluxury-goods markets prone to counterfeiting. More ambitious counterfeiters\nmight remove an authentic label and place it on a bottle with a similar shape,\nusually from the same vineyard, which contains a cheaper wine. Savvy buyers\ncould identify if the cork does not match the label, but how many normal\nconsumers like us could manage to identify the fake with only eye scanning?\n  NFC facilitates processing of wine products information, making it a\npromising technology for anti-counterfeiting. The proposed system is aimed at\nrelatively high-end consumer products like wine, and it helps protect genuine\nwine by maintaining the product pedigree such as the transaction records and\nthe supply chain integrity. As such, consumers can safeguard their stake by\nauthenticating a specific wine with their NFC-enabled smartphones before making\npayment at retail points.\n  NFC has emerged as a potential tool to combat wine and spirit counterfeiting,\nundermining international wine trading market and even the global economy\nhugely. Recently, a number of anti-counterfeiting approaches have been proposed\nand adopted utilising different authentication technologies for such purpose.\nThe project presents an NFC-enabled anti-counterfeiting system, and addresses\npossible implementation issues, such as tag selection, tag programming and\nencryption, setup of back-end database servers and the design of NFC mobile\napplication.",

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) systems were\nused, such as the OpenSimulator and various 3D renderers, to create a replica\nof the TUP-T campus in a simulated 3D world. The 3D-AVLE runs in a single\nserver that is connected to the learners' computers via a simply-wired local\narea network (LAN). The use of various networking optimization techniques was\nexperimented on to provide the learners and the instructors alike a seamless\nexperience and lag-less immersion within the 3D-AVLE. With the current LAN\nsetup in TUP-T, the optimal number of concurrent users that can be accommodated\nwithout sacrificing connectivity and the quality of virtual experience was\nfound to be at 30 users, exactly the mean class size in TUP-T. The 3D-AVLE\nallows for recording of the learners' experiences which provides the learners a\nfacility to review the lessons at a later time.

    "summary": "Functional technical performance usually follows an exponential dependence on\ntime but the rate of change (the exponent) varies greatly among technological\ndomains. This paper presents a simple model that provides an explanatory\nfoundation for these phenomena based upon the inventive design process.\n  The model assumes that invention - novel and useful design- arises through\nprobabilistic analogical transfers that combine existing knowledge by combining\nexisting individual operational ideas to arrive at new individual operating\nideas. The continuing production of individual operating ideas relies upon\ninjection of new basic individual operating ideas that occurs through coupling\nof science and technology simulations.\n  The individual operational ideas that result from this process are then\nmodeled as being assimilated in components of artifacts characteristic of a\ntechnological domain. According to the model, two effects (differences in\ninteractions among components for different domains and differences in scaling\nlaws for different domains) account for the differences found in improvement\nrates among domains whereas the analogical transfer process is the source of\nthe exponential behavior. The model is supported by a number of known empirical\nfacts: further empirical research is suggested to independently assess further\npredictions made by the model.",

    "publish": "2016-03-04T02:32:23Z", 
    "summary": "Today's geo-location estimation approaches are able to infer the location of\na target image using its visual content alone. These approaches exploit visual\nmatching techniques, applied to a large collection of background images with\nknown geo-locations. Users who are unaware that visual retrieval approaches can\ncompromise their geo-privacy, unwittingly open themselves to risks of crime or\nother unintended consequences. Private photo sharing is not able to protect\nusers effectively, since its inconvenience is a barrier to consistent use, and\nphotos can still fall into the wrong hands if they are re-shared. This paper\nlays the groundwork for a new approach to geo-privacy of social images: Instead\nof requiring a complete change of user behavior, we investigate the protection\npotential latent in users existing practices. We carry out a series of\nretrieval experiments using a large collection of social images (8.5M) to\nsystematically analyze where users should be wary, and how both photo taking\nand editing practices impact the performance of geo-location estimation. We\nfind that practices that are currently widespread are already sufficient to\nprotect single-handedly the geo-location ('geo-cloak') up to more than 50% of\nimages whose location would otherwise be automatically predictable. Our\nconclusion is that protecting users against the unwanted effects of visual\nretrieval is a viable research field, and should take as its starting point\nexisting user practices.",

    "summary": "As the Internet grows in importance, it is vital to develop methods and\ntechniques for educating end-users to improve their awareness of online\nprivacy. Web-based education tools have been proven effective in many domains\nand have been increasingly adopted by many online professional and educational\nservices.

    "summary": "The concern over global urbanization trend imposes smart-city as enabling\ninformation and communication technology (ICT) to improve urban governance.\nHowever, the light trance on better living space is stimulated by socioeconomic\nimpact of escalated senior generation. Hence, ambient assisted living (AAL)\nemerges for the autonomous provisioning of pervasive things or objects from\nrelevant perturbation for advanced scientific instrumentation. Meanwhile,\ncitizens are observed in being transfixed by lively stimuli of monotonous urban\nevents with the advent of virtual reality or augmented things. Thus, due to the\ninvolvement of situation-awareness or contextualization,\nengagement/participation information as a utility promises to improve urban\nexperience. However, it is complex to grapple meaningful concepts due to\npersonalization obstacles, such as citizen psychology, information gap,\nservice-visualization. Moreover, recommended practices deficit adaptation to\nmonochromatic choice, disparate impairments, mobility and annotation-richness\nin urban space. Hence, rejuvenation of engagement relates to monitoring and\nquantification of 'service consumption and graceful degradation' of experience.\nHowever, paramount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as,\nunobservability, independence and composite relationship of contexts.\nTherefore, a parametric Bayesian based model is envisioned to address\nobservability and scalability of contexts and its conjugal relationship with\nengagement.

    "summary": "Computational social scientists often harness the Web as a \"societal\nobservatory\" where data about human social behavior is collected. This data\nenables novel investigations of psychological, anthropological and sociological\nresearch questions. However, in the absence of demographic information, such as\ngender, many relevant research questions cannot be addressed. To tackle this\nproblem, researchers often rely on automated methods to infer gender from name\ninformation provided on the web. However, little is known about the accuracy of\nexisting gender-detection methods and how biased they are against certain\nsub-populations. In this paper, we address this question by systematically\ncomparing several gender detection methods on a random sample of scientists for\nwhom we know their full name, their gender and the country of their workplace.\nWe further suggest a novel method that employs web-based image retrieval and\ngender recognition in facial images in order to augment name-based approaches.\nOur findings show that the performance of name-based gender detection\napproaches can be biased towards countries of origin and such biases can be\nreduced by combining name-based an image-based gender detection methods.",

The absence of trust could affect the acceptance\nof sharing data in smart cities.

    "summary": "Science education will play a vital role in shaping the present and future of\nmodern societies. Thus, Europe needs all its talents to increase creativity and\ncompetitiveness. Young boys and girls especially have to be engaged to pursue\ncareers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). However,\nstatistics still show that enrolment rates in STEM-based degree programs are\ndecreasing. This will lead to a workforce problem in the industrial sector as\nwell as in research and development, especially in many of the new member\ncountries. This paper highlights a recently funded EU-research project\nSciChallenge (www.scichallenge.eu), which focuses on the development of novel\nconcepts to get young people excited about science education. It uses a\ncontest-based approach towards self-produced digital education materials from\nyoung people for young people. In cooperation with partner schools, teachers,\nand other youth-oriented institutions, the contest participants (individuals or\ngroups) between the ages of 10 and 20 years generate creative digital materials\n(videos, slides, or infographics). The participants upload their content in\nsocial media channels and the submissions are aggregated on the SciChallenge\nWeb Platform. The winners receive prizes funded by science-oriented industry\nand other stakeholders. Intelligent cross-sectoral positioning of various\nawareness modules on the SciChallenge Open Information Hub is expected to\nincrease awareness on science careers. Through a strong involvement of related\norganizations and industries, we expect to open new opportunities for young\npeople in regards to internships or taster days in STEM disciplines.\nAdditionally, aggregated information on science events (such as, slams, nights,\nfestivals) is shared. With this multi-level approach, SciChallenge may boost\nthe attractiveness of science education and careers among young people.",

    "summary": "The social conventions and expectations around the appropriate use of imaging\nand video has been transformed by the availability of video cameras in our\npockets. The impact on law enforcement can easily be seen by watching the\nnightly news; more and more arrests, interventions, or even routine stops are\nbeing caught on cell phones or surveillance video, with both positive and\nnegative consequences. This proliferation of the use of video has led law\nenforcement to look at the potential benefits of incorporating video capture\nsystematically in their day to day operations. At the same time, recognition of\nthe inevitability of widespread use of video for police operations has caused a\nrush to deploy all types of cameras, including body worn cameras. However, the\nvast majority of police agencies have limited experience in utilizing video to\nits full advantage, and thus do not have the capability to fully realize the\nvalue of expanding their video capabilities. In this white paper, we highlight\nsome of the technology needs and challenges of body-worn cameras, and we relate\nthese needs to the relevant state of the art in computer vision and multimedia\nresearch. We conclude with a set of recommendations.",
