    "summary": "Recent network traffic studies argue that network arrival processes are much\nmore faithfully modeled using statistically self-similar processes instead of\ntraditional Poisson processes [LTWW94,PF95]. One difficulty in dealing with\nself-similar models is how to efficiently synthesize traces (sample paths)\ncorresponding to self-similar traffic. We present a fast Fourier transform\nmethod for synthesizing approximate self-similar sample paths for one type of\nself-similar process, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and assess its performance and\nvalidity. We find that the method is as fast or faster than existing methods\nand appears to generate close approximations to true self-similar sample paths.\nWe also discuss issues in using such synthesized sample paths for simulating\nnetwork traffic, and how an approximation used by our method can dramatically\nspeed up evaluation of Whittle's estimator for H, the Hurst parameter giving\nthe strength of long-range dependence present in a self-similar time series."

    "summary": "The main goals of a switch scheme are high utilization, low queuing delay and\nfairness. To achieve high utilization the switch scheme can maintain non-zero\n(small) queues in steady state which can be used if the sources do not have\ndata to send. Queue length (delay) can be controlled if part of the link\ncapacity is used for draining queues in the event of queue build up. In most\nschemes a simple threshold function is used for queue control. Better control\nof the queue and hence delay can be achieved by using sophisticated queue\ncontrol functions. It is very important to design and analyze such queue\ncontrol functions. We study step, linear, hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic\nqueue control functions. Analytical explanation and simulation results\nconsistent with analysis are presented. From the study, we conclude that\ninverse hyperbolic is the best control function and to reduce complexity the\nlinear control function can be used since it performs satisfactorily in most\ncases."

We study the effect of such VBR traffic on ABR carrying TCP traffic.\nThe effect of such VBR traffic is that the ABR capacity is highly variant.

A crucial concern in\nthe case of multiple senders is how to define fairness within a multicast group\nand among groups and point-to-point connections. Fairness definition can be\ncomplicated since the multipoint connection can have the same identifier\n(VPI/VCI) on each link, and senders might not be distinguishable in this case.\nMany rate allocation algorithms implicitly assume that there is only one sender\nin each VC, which does not hold for multipoint-to-point cases. We give various\npossibilities for defining fairness for multipoint connections, and show the\ntradeoffs involved. In addition, we show that ATM bandwidth allocation\nalgorithms need to be adapted to give fair allocations for multipoint-to-point\nconnections."

A satellite ATM network consists of a space segment\nof satellites connected by inter-satellite crosslinks, and a ground segment of\nthe various ATM networks. A satellite-ATM interface module connects the\nsatellite network to the ATM networks and performs various call and control\nfunctions. A network control center performs various network management and\nresource allocation functions. Several issues such as the ATM service model,\nmedia access protocols, and traffic management issues must be considered when\ndesigning a satellite ATM network to effectively transport Internet traffic. We\nhave presented the buffer requirements for TCP/IP traffic over ATM-UBR for\nsatellite latencies. Our results are based on TCP with selective\nacknowledgments and a per-VC buffer management policy at the switches. A buffer\nsize of about 0.5 * RTT to 1 * RTT is sufficient to provide over 98% throughput\nto infinite TCP traffic for long latency networks and a large number of\nsources. This buffer requirement is independent of the number of sources. The\nfairness is high for a large numbers of sources because of the per-VC buffer\nmanagement performed at the switches and the nature of TCP traffic."

A number of algorithms have been developed for extending ABR congestion\navoidance algorithms to perform feedback consolidation at the branch points.\nThis paper discusses various design options and implementation alternatives for\nthe consolidation algorithms, and proposes a number of new algorithms. The\nperformance of the proposed algorithms and the previous algorithms is compared\nunder a variety of conditions.

IP integrated services over ATM poses further\nchallenges to ATM multicasting. Scalability and simplicity are the two main\nconcerns for ATM multicasting. This paper provides a survey of the current work\non multicasting problems in general, and ATM multicasting in particular.

One of the\narchitectural features in the ABR specification [tm4] is the Virtual\nSource/Virtual Destination (VS/VD) option. This option allows a switch to\ndivide an end-to-end ABR connection into separately controlled ABR segments by\nacting like a destination on one segment, and like a source on the other. The\ncoupling in the VS/VD switch between the two ABR control segments is\nimplementation specific. In this paper, we model a VS/VD ATM switch and study\nthe issues in designing coupling between ABR segments. We identify a number of\nimplementation options for the coupling. A good choice significantly improves\nthe stability and transient performance of the system and reduces the buffer\nrequirements at the switches."

The ATM Forum\ntraffic management group also incorporated open-loop control capabilities to\nmake the ABR service robust to temporary network failures and source\ninactivity. An important problem addressed was whether rate allocations of\nsources should be taken away if sources do not use them. The proposed\nsolutions, popularly known as the Use-It-or-Lose-It (UILI) policies, have had\nsignificant impact on the ABR service capabilities. In this paper we discuss\nthe design, development, and the final shape of these policies and their impact\non the ABR service. We compare the various alternatives through a performance\nevaluation."

The VBR background introduces variance in\nthe ABR capacity and the TCP traffic introduces variance in the ABR demand.\nSome simple switch schemes are unable to keep up with the combined effect of\nhighly varying demands and highly varying ABR capacity.

A simple definition for congestion based on supply and demand of\nresources is proposed and is then used to classify various congestion schemes.\nThe issues that make the congestion problem a difficult one are discussed, and\nthen the architectural decisions that affect the design of a congestion scheme\nare presented.

    "summary": "The size of computer networks, along with their bandwidths, is growing\nexponentially. To support these large, high-speed networks, it is neccessary to\nbe able to forward packets in a few microseconds. One part of the forwarding\noperation consists of searching through a large address databse. This problem\nis encountered in the design of bridges, routers, gateways and name servers.\n  Caching can reduce the lookup time if there is a locality in the address\nreference pattern. Using a destination reference trace measured on an extended\nlocal are a network, we attempt to see if the destination refernces do have a\nsignificant locality.\n  We compared the performance of MIN, LRU, FIFO, and random cache replacement\nalgorithms. We found that the interactive (terminal) traffic in our sample had\nquite different locality behavior than that of the noninteractive traffic. The\ninteractive traffic did not follow the LRU stack model while the\nnoninteractivetraffic did. Examples are shown of the environments in which\ncaching can help as well as those in which caching can hurt, unless the cache\nsize is large."

    "summary": "In heterogeneous networks, achieving congestion avoidance is difficult\nbecause the congestion feedback from one subnetwork may have no meaning to\nsource on other other subnetworks. We propose using changes in round-trip delay\nas an implicit feedback. Using a black-box model of the network, we derive an\nexpression for the optimal window as a function of the gradient of the\ndelay-window curve.\n  The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are also addressed. It is\nshown that without a careful design, it is possible to get into a race\ncondition during heavy congestion, where each user wants more resources than\nothers, thereby leading to a diverging congestion\n  It is shown that congestion avoidance using round trip delay is a promising\napproach. The aproach has the advantage that there is absolutely no overhead\nfor the network itself. It is exemplified by a simple scheme. The performance\nof the scheme is analyzed using a simulation model. The scheme is shown to be\nefficient, fair, convergent and adaptive to changes in network configuration.\n  The scheme as described works only for networks that can ne modelled with\nqueueing servers with constant service times. Further research is required to\nextend it for implementation in practical networks. Several directions for\nfuture research have beensuggested."

We compare\nthe concept of congestion avoidance with that of congestion control.\n  Briefly, congestion control is a recovery mechanism, while congestion\navoidance is a prevention mechanism. A congestion control scheme helps the\nnetwork to recover from the congestion state while a congestion avoidance\nscheme allows a network to operate in the region of low delay and high\nthroughput with minimal queuing, thereby preventing it from entering the\ncongested state in which packets are lost due to buffer shortage.\n  A number of possible alternatives for congestion avoidance were identified.\n  From these alternatives we selected one called the binary feedback scheme in\nwhich the network uses a single bit in the network layer header to feed back\nthe congestion information to its users, which then increase or decrease their\nload to make optimal use of the resources. The concept of global optimality in\na distributed system is defined in terms of efficiency and fairness such that\nthey can be independently quantified and apply to any number of resources and\nusers.\n  The proposed scheme has been simulated and shown to be globally efficient,\nfair, responsive, convergent, robust, distributed, and\nconfiguration-independent."

A congestion control scheme helps the network to recover\nfrom the congestion state. A congestion avoidance scheme allows a network to\noperate in the region of low delay and high throughput. Such schemes prevent a\nnetwork from entering the congested state. Congestion avoidance is a prevention\nmechanism while congestion control is a recovery mechanism. We compare the\nconcept of congestion avoidance with that of flow control and congestion\ncontrol. A number of possible alternative for congestion avoidance have been\nidentified. From these a few were selected for study. The criteria for\nselection and goals for these schemes have been described. In particular, we\nwanted the scheme to be globally efficient, fair, dynamic, convergent, robust,\ndistributed, configuration independent, etc. These goals and the test cases\nused to verify whether a particular scheme has met the goals have been\ndescribed. We model the network and the user policies for congestion avoidance\nas a feedback control system. The key components of a generic congestion\navoidance scheme are: congestion detection, congestion feedback, feedback\nselector, signal filter, decision function, and increase/decrease algorithms.\nThese components have been explained."

The\nresulting timeouts at the source provide an implicit mechanism to convey\ncongestion signals from the network to the source. On a timeout, a source\nshould not only retransmit the lost packet, but it should also reduce its load\non the network. Based on this realization, we have developed a simple\ncongestion control scheme using the acknowledgment timeouts as indications of\npacket loss and congestion. This scheme does not require any new message\nformats, therefore, it can be used in any network with window flow control,\ne.g., ARPAnet or ISO."

Also, the\nsource has to decide whether to send just one packet or to send all packets\nfollowing it. This leads to four different types of caching schemes.\nSimulations show, against our immediate intuition, that regardless of whether\nthe destination is caching or not, the source should retransmit only one\npacket.

It is independent of the amount of the\nresource. The fairness index always lies between 0 and 1. This boundedness aids\nintuitive understanding of the fairness index.

Flooding techniques have been used previously, e.g. for\nbroadcasting the routing table in the ARPAnet [1] and other special purpose\nnetworks [3][4][5]. However, sending data using flooding can often saturate the\nnetwork [2] and it is usually regarded as an inefficient broadcast mechanism.\nOur approach is to flood a very short packet to explore an optimal route\nwithout relying on a pre-established routing table, and an efficient flood\ncontrol algorithm to reduce the signalling traffic overhead. This is an\ninherently robust mechanism in the face of a network configuration change,\nachieves automatic load sharing across alternative routes and has potential to\nsolve many contemporary routing problems. An earlier version of this mechanism\nwas originally developed for virtual circuit establishment in the experimental\nCaroline ATM LAN [6][7] at Monash University."

We build on the\nconcept of embedded management application, proposed by Wellens and Auerbach,\nand present two models of network management application designs that rely on\nWeb technologies. First, the pull model is based on the request/response\nparadigm. It is typically used to perform data polling. Several commercial\nmanagement platforms already use Web technologies that rely on this model to\nprovide for ad hoc management; we demonstrate how to extend this to regular\nmanagement. Second, the push model is a novel approach which relies on the\npublish/subscribe/distribute paradigm. It is better suited to regular\nmanagement than the pull model, and allows administrators to conserve network\nbandwidth as well as CPU time on the management station. It can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the paradigm commonly used for notification delivery.\nFinally, we introduce the concept of the collapsed network management platform,\nwhere these two models coexist."

    "summary": "A TCP trunk is an IP tunnel under TCP control, capable of carrying packets\nfrom any number of user flows. By exploiting properties of TCP, a TCP trunk\nprovides elastic and reliable transmission over a network, and automatically\nshares the network fairly with other competing trunks. Moreover, by aggregating\nuser flows into a single trunk flow, TCP trunking can significantly reduce the\nnumber of flows that the network needs to manage, thereby allowing use of\nsimplified management to achieve improved perfor mance. For example, when\ndealing with only a small number of TCP trunk flows, a router with a simple\nFIFO buffer can experience low packet loss rates.\n  A TCP trunk is a \"soft\" circuit in the sense that it requires no flow states\nto be maintained inside the network. Setting up a TCP trunk involves only\nconfiguring the two end nodes. This is in contrast with traditional methods of\nconfiguring circuits via signaling of network nodes.\n  A simple packet-dropping mechanism based on packet accounting at the\ntransmitter of a TCP trunk assures that, when the trunk reduces its bandwidth\nin response to network congestion, user TCP flows carried by the trunk will\nreduce their bandwidths by the same proportion. Simu lation results have\ndemonstrated that TCP trunks can provide improved network performance to users,\nwhile achieving high network utilization."

It explains how\nthe AVNMP facilitates the management of an active network by allowing future\npredicted state information within an active network to be available to network\nmanagement algorithms. This is accomplished by coupling ideas from optimistic\ndiscrete event simulation with active networking. The optimistic discrete event\nsimulation method used is a form of self-adjusting Time Warp. It is\nself-adjusting because the system adjusts for predictions which are inaccurate\nbeyond a given tolerance. The concept of a streptichron and autoanaplasis are\nintroduced as mechanisms which take advantage of the enhanced flexibility and\nintelligence of active packets. Finally, it is demonstrated that the AVNMP is a\nfeasible concept."

    "summary": "This paper extends a stochastic theory for buffer fill distribution for\nmultiple ``on'' and ``off'' sources to a mobile environment. Queue fill\ndistribution is described by a set of differential equations assuming sources\nalternate asynchronously between exponentially distributed periods in ``on''\nand ``off'' states. This paper includes the probabilities that mobile sources\nhave links to a given queue. The sources represent mobile user nodes, and the\nqueue represents the capacity of a switch. This paper presents a method of\nanalysis which uses mobile parameters such as speed, call rates per unit area,\ncell area, and call duration and determines queue fill distribution at the ATM\ncell level. The analytic results are compared with simulation results."

    "summary": "This research concentrates on the design and analysis of an algorithm\nreferred to as Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) which uses predicted future\nstates of a system for faster network configuration and management. VNC is\napplied to the configuration of a wireless mobile ATM network. VNC is built on\ntechniques from parallel discrete event simulation merged with constraints from\nreal-time systems and applied to mobile ATM configuration and handoff.\n  Configuration in a mobile network is a dynamic and continuous process.\nFactors such as load, distance, capacity and topology are all constantly\nchanging in a mobile environment. The VNC algorithm anticipates configuration\nchanges and speeds the reconfiguration process by pre-computing and caching\nresults. VNC propagates local prediction results throughout the VNC enhanced\nsystem. The Global Positioning System is an enabling technology for the use of\nVNC in mobile networks because it provides location information and accurate\ntime for each node.\n  This research has resulted in well defined structures for the encapsulation\nof physical processes within Logical Processes and a generic library for\nenhancing a system with VNC. Enhancing an existing system with VNC is straight\nforward assuming the existing physical processes do not have side effects. The\nbenefit of prediction is gained at the cost of additional traffic and\nprocessing. This research includes an analysis of VNC and suggestions for\noptimization of the VNC algorithm and its parameters."

    "summary": "Many applications want to use TCP congestion control to regulate the\ntransmission rate of a data packet stream. A natural way to achieve this goal\nis to transport the data packet stream on a TCP connection. However, because\nTCP implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet\nstream directly using a TCP connection forces the data packet stream to be\nsubject to TCP's other properties caused by TCP error control, which may be\ninappropriate for these applications.\n  The TCP decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of\napplying TCP congestion control to a data packet stream without actually\ntransporting the data packet stream on a TCP connection. Instead, a TCP\nconnection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up\nseparately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then\nassociated with that of the TCP packets. Since the transmission rate of these\nTCP packets is under TCP congestion control, so is that of the data packet\nstream. Furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a TCP\nconnection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to TCP error\ncontrol.\n  Because of this flexibility, the TCP decoupling approach opens up many new\nopportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some\nexisting applications. All of these advantages will be demonstrated in the\nthesis.\n  This thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the TCP\ndecoupling approach, and its successful applications in TCP trunking, wireless\ncommunication, and multimedia streaming."

This system is a natural application of multicast because\nthere are a large number of receivers that should receive the same information\nsimultaneously.\n  The data requirements for the stock exchange are discussed. The current\nmulticast protocols lack the reliability, fairness, and scalability needed in\nthis application. We describe a distributed architecture together with a\nreliable multicast protocol, a modification of the RMP protocol, that has\ncharacteristics appropriate for this application.\n  The architecture is used in three applications: In the first, we construct a\nunified stock ticker of the transactions that are being conducted on the\nvarious physical and electronic exchanges. Our objective is to deliver the the\nsame combined ticker reliably and simultaneously to all receivers, anywhere in\nthe world. In the second, we construct a unified sequence of buy and sell\noffers that are delivered to a single exchange or a collection of exchanges.\nOur objective is to give all traders the same fair access to an exchange\nindependent of their relative distances to the exchange or the loss\ncharacteristics of the international network. In the third, we construct a\ndistributed, electronic trading floor that can replace the current exchanges.\nThis application uses the innovations from the first two applications to\ncombine their fairness attributes."

That is, as long as any one of them is true, the\nother can be derived from it, and {\\it vice versa}. Although these two laws are\nequivalent, they provide different ways to measure the exponents of their\ncorresponding power law relations. We also show that these two measures will\ngive equivalent results, but with different error bars. We argue that for nodes\nof not very large out-degree($\\leq 32$ in our simulation), the first Faloutsos'\nPower Law is superior to the second one in giving a better estimate of the\nexponent, while for nodes of very large out-degree($> 32$) the power law\nrelation may not be present, at least for the relation between the frequency of\nout-degree and node out-degree."

    "summary": "IP mobility addresses the problem of changing the network point-of-attachment\ntransparently during movement. Mobile IP is the proposed standard by IETF.\nSeveral studies, however, have shown that Mobile IP has several drawbacks, such\nas triangle routing and poor handoff performance. Multicast-based mobility has\nbeen proposed as a promising solution to the above problems, incurring less\nend-to-end delays and fast smooth handoff. Nonetheless, such architecture\nsuffers from multicast state scalability problems with the growth in number of\nmobile nodes. This architecture also requires ubiquitous multicast deployment\nand more complex security measures. To alleviate these problems, we propose an\nintra-domain multicast-based mobility solution. A mobility proxy allocates a\nmulticast address for each mobile that moves to its domain. The mobile uses\nthis multicast address within a domain for micro mobility. Also, aggregation is\nconsidered to reduce the multicast state. We conduct multicast state analysis\nto study the efficiency of several aggregation techniques. We use extensive\nsimulation to evaluate our protocol's performance over a variety of real and\ngenerated topologies. We take aggregation gain as metric for our evaluation.\n  Our simulation results show that in general leaky aggregation obtains better\ngains than perfect aggregation. Also, we notice that aggregation gain increases\nwith the increase in number of visiting mobile nodes and with the decrease in\nnumber of mobility proxies within a domain."

    "summary": "Recently the problem of indexing and locating content in peer-to-peer\nnetworks has received much attention. Previous work suggests caching index\nentries at intermediate nodes that lie on the paths taken by search queries,\nbut until now there has been little focus on how to maintain these intermediate\ncaches. This paper proposes CUP, a new comprehensive architecture for\nControlled Update Propagation in peer-to-peer networks. CUP asynchronously\nbuilds caches of index entries while answering search queries. It then\npropagates updates of index entries to maintain these caches. Under unfavorable\nconditions, when compared with standard caching based on expiration times, CUP\nreduces the average miss latency by as much as a factor of three. Under\nfavorable conditions, CUP can reduce the average miss latency by more than a\nfactor of ten.\n  CUP refreshes intermediate caches, reduces query latency, and reduces network\nload by coalescing bursts of queries for the same item. CUP controls and\nconfines propagation to updates whose cost is likely to be recovered by\nsubsequent queries. CUP gives peer-to-peer nodes the flexibility to use their\nown incentive-based policies to determine when to receive and when to propagate\nupdates. Finally, the small propagation overhead incurred by CUP is more than\ncompensated for by its savings in cache misses."

Traffic marking is an important component of this\nframework. In this paper, we propose two new aggregate markers that are\nstateless, scalable and fair. We leverage stateless Active Queue Management\n(AQM) algorithms to enable fair and efficient token distribution among\nindividual flows of an aggregate. The first marker, Probabilistic Aggregate\nMarker (PAM), uses the Token Bucket burst size to probabilistically mark\nincoming packets to ensure TCP-friendly and proportionally fair marking. The\nsecond marker, Stateless Aggregate Fair Marker (F-SAM) approximates fair\nqueueing techniques to isolate flows while marking packets of the aggregate. It\ndistributes tokens evenly among the flows without maintaining per-flow state.\nOur simulation results show that our marking strategies show upto 30%\nimprovement over other commonly used markers while marking flow aggregates.\nThese improvements are in terms of better average throughput and fairness\nindices, in scenarios containing heterogeneous traffic consisting of TCP (both\nlong lived elephants and short lived mice) and misbehaving UDP flows. As a\nbonus, F-SAM helps the mice to win the war against elephants."

Wireless networks are spatial\ngraphs that are usually much more clustered than random networks and have much\nhigher path length characteristics. We observe that by adding only few random\nlinks, path length of wireless networks can be reduced drastically without\naffecting clustering. What is even more interesting is that such links need not\nbe formed randomly but may be confined to a limited number of hops between the\nconnected nodes. This has an important practical implication, as now we can\nintroduce a distributed algorithm in large-scale wireless networks, based on\nwhat we call contacts, to improve the performance of resource discovery in such\nnetworks, without resorting to global flooding. We propose new contact-based\nprotocols for adding logical short cuts in wireless networks efficiently. The\nnew protocols take advantage of mobility in order to increase reachability of\nthe search. We study the performance of our proposed contact-based\narchitecture, and clarify the context in which large-scale wireless networks\ncan be turned into small world networks."

    "summary": "In this paper we propose a novel architecture, CARD, for resource discovery\nin large scale Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANets) which, may scale up to thousands\nof nodes and may span wide geographical regions. Unlike previously proposed\nschemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding\nas well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy. CARD is also\nindependent of any external source of information such as GPS. In our\narchitecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the\nneighborhood of that node. Resources within the neighborhood can be readily\naccessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood. For\naccessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few\ndistant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the\nnetwork and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the\nneighborhood. As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view\n(reachability) of the node increases. Paths to contacts are validated\nperiodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection\nand maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing\noverhead. Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in\nreachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the\nother. Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable\nreachability distribution for different network sizes. Comparisons with other\nschemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our\narchitecture to be much more efficient and scalable."

    "summary": "One of the most important metrics in the design of IP mobility protocols is\nthe handover performance. The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown\nto exhibit poor handover performance. Most other work attempts to modify MIP to\nslightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to\nreplace MIP. Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new\narchitecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to\nco-exist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an\nintra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is\nassigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient\nhandover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms. Two\napproaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept\nproxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the\nmulticast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping\napproach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms\nto support it. Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme\nand compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.\nThe proactive handover results show that both M&M and CIP shows low handoff\ndelay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&M's\ncomparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.\nThe M&M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.\nWe also provide a handover algorithm leveraging the proactive path setup\ncapability of M&M, which is expected to outperform CIP in case of reactive\nhandover."

    "summary": "Conventional optical networks are based on SONET rings, but since rings are\nknown to use bandwidth inefficiently, there has been much research into shared\nmesh protection, which promises significant bandwidth savings. Unfortunately,\nmost shared mesh protection schemes cannot guarantee that failed traffic will\nbe restored within the 50 ms timeframe that SONET standards specify. A notable\nexception is the p-cycle scheme of Grover and Stamatelakis. We argue, however,\nthat p-cycles have certain limitations, e.g., there is no easy way to adapt\np-cycles to a path-based protection scheme, and p-cycles seem more suited to\nstatic traffic than to dynamic traffic. In this paper we show that the key to\nfast restoration times is not a ring-like topology per se, but rather the\nability to pre-cross-connect protection paths. This leads to the concept of a\npre-cross-connected trail or PXT, which is a structure that is more flexible\nthan rings and that adapts readily to both path-based and link-based schemes\nand to both static and dynamic traffic. The PXT protection scheme achieves fast\nrestoration speeds, and our simulations, which have been carefully chosen using\nideas from experimental design theory, show that the bandwidth efficiency of\nthe PXT protection scheme is comparable to that of conventional shared mesh\nprotection schemes."

    "summary": "Many ad hoc routing protocols are based on some variant of flooding. Despite\nvarious optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We\npropose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with\nsome probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping\nexhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions,\nthe gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the\nremaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The\nfraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the\ngossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have\nconsidered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure\nthat almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large\nnetworks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than\nflooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with\nvarious optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show\nthat adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement,\neven in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should\nbe even more significant in larger networks."

    "summary": "The topology of a wireless multi-hop network can be controlled by varying the\ntransmission power at each node. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of\na cone-based distributed topology control algorithm. This algorithm, introduced\nin [16], does not assume that nodes have GPS information available; rather it\ndepends only on directional information. Roughly speaking, the basic idea of\nthe algorithm is that a node $u$ transmits with the minimum power\n$p_{u,\\alpha}$ required to ensure that in every cone of degree $\\alpha$ around\n$u$, there is some node that $u$ can reach with power $p_{u,\\alpha}$. We show\nthat taking $\\alpha = 5\\pi/6$ is a necessary and sufficient condition to\nguarantee that network connectivity is preserved. More precisely, if there is a\npath from $s$ to $t$ when every node communicates at maximum power, then, if\n$\\alpha <= 5\\pi/6$, there is still a path in the smallest symmetric graph\n$G_\\alpha$ containing all edges $(u,v)$ such that $u$ can communicate with $v$\nusing power $p_{u,\\alpha}$. On the other hand, if $\\alpha > 5\\pi/6$,\nconnectivity is not necessarily preserved. We also propose a set of\noptimizations that further reduce power consumption and prove that they retain\nnetwork connectivity. Dynamic reconfiguration in the presence of failures and\nmobility is also discussed. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the algorithm and the optimizations."

A node may decide not to cooperate\nto save its resources while still using the network to relay its traffic. If\ntoo many nodes exhibit this behavior, network performance degrades and\ncooperating nodes may find themselves unfairly loaded. Most previous efforts to\ncounter this behavior have relied on further cooperation between nodes to\nexchange reputation information about other nodes. If a node observes another\nnode not participating correctly, it reports this observation to other nodes\nwho then take action to avoid being affected and potentially punish the bad\nnode by refusing to forward its traffic. Unfortunately, such second-hand\nreputation information is subject to false accusations and requires maintaining\ntrust relationships with other nodes. The objective of OCEAN is to avoid this\ntrust-management machinery and see how far we can get simply by using direct\nfirst-hand observations of other nodes' behavior. We find that, in many\nscenarios, OCEAN can do as well as, or even better than, schemes requiring\nsecond-hand reputation exchanges. This encouraging result could possibly help\nobviate solutions requiring trust-management for some contexts."

Using these basic concepts, we analyze the architectural\nimplications on the network structure: in a nutshell, if we want that\n-theodolites- serve as a reference, than the contribution to the relevant\nnetwork metrics due to the -monitoring domain- infrastructure must be\nnegligible with respect to contributions of the inter-domain infrastructure. In\naddition all -theodolites- of a -monitoring domain- must give an image of the\ninter-domain infrastructure that is consistent with that experienced by network\napplications. We conclude giving a running SQL example of how information about\n-monitoring domains- and -theodolites- could be organized, and we outline the\napplication of such framework in the GLUE schema activity for the network\nelement"

    "summary": "It starts out innocently enough - users want to monitor Online data and so\nrun their own copies of the detector control GUIs in their offices and at home.\nBut over time, the number of processes making requests for values to display on\nGUIs, webpages and stripcharts can grow, and affect the performance of an\nInput/Output Controller (IOC) such that it is unable to respond to requests\nfrom requests critical to data-taking. At worst, an IOC can hang, its CPU\nhaving been allocated 100% to responding to network requests.\n  For the BaBar Online Detector Control System, we were able to eliminate this\nproblem and make great gains in security by moving all of the IOCs to a\nnon-routed, virtual LAN and by enlisting a workstation with two network\ninterface cards to act as the interface between the virtual LAN and the public\nBaBar network. On the interface machine, we run the Experimental Physics\nIndustrial Control System (EPICS) Channel Access (CA) gateway software\n(originating from Advanced Photon Source). This software accepts as inputs, all\nthe channels which are loaded into the EPICS databases on all the IOCs. It\npolls them to update its copy of the values. It answers requests from\napplications by sending them the currently cached value.\n  We adopted the requirement that data-taking would be independent of the\ngateway, so that, in the event of a gateway failure, data-taking would be\nuninterrupted. In this way, we avoided introducing any new risk elements to\ndata-taking. Security rules already in use by the IOC were propagated to the\ngateway's own security rules and the security of the IOCs themselves was\nimproved by removing them from the public BaBar network."

    "summary": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are one of the most challenging threats to\nInternet security. An attacker typically compromises a large number of\nvulnerable hosts and uses them to flood the victim's site with malicious\ntraffic, clogging its tail circuit and interfering with normal traffic. At\npresent, the network operator of a site under attack has no other resolution\nbut to respond manually by inserting filters in the appropriate edge routers to\ndrop attack traffic. However, as DoS attacks become increasingly sophisticated,\nmanual filter propagation becomes unacceptably slow or even infeasible.\n  In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering, a new automatic\nfilter propagation protocol. We argue that this system provides a guaranteed,\nsignificant level of protection against DoS attacks in exchange for a\nreasonable, bounded amount of router resources. We also argue that the proposed\nsystem cannot be abused by a malicious node to interfere with normal Internet\noperation. Finally, we argue that it retains its efficiency in the face of\ncontinued Internet growth."

In this paper, we propose the\nOptimized Flooding Protocol (OFP), based on a variation of The Covering Problem\nthat is encountered in geometry, to minimize the unnecessary transmissions\ndrastically and still be able to cover the whole region. OFP does not need\nhello messages and hence OFP saves a significant amount of wireless bandwidth\nand incurs lesser overhead. We present simulation results to show the\nefficiency of OFP in both ideal cases and randomly distributed networks.\nMoreover, OFP is scalable with respect to density; in fact OFP requires lesser\nnumber of transmissions at higher densities. OFP is also resilient to\ntransmission errors."

In this paper, we define a set of applications that require a\nnew form of distributed knowledge about the environment, referred to as\nnon-uniform information granularity. By non-uniform information granularity we\nmean that the required accuracy or precision of information is proportional to\nthe distance between a source node (information producer) and current sink node\n(information consumer). That is, as the distance between the source node and\nsink node increases, loss in information precision is acceptable.

    "summary": "The ability of a sensor node to determine its physical location within a\nnetwork (Localization) is of fundamental importance in sensor networks.\nInterpretating data from sensors will not be possible unless the context of the\ndata is known; this is most often accomplished by tracking its physical\nlocation. Existing research has focused on localization in static sensor\nnetworks where localization is a one-time (or low frequency) activity. In\ncontrast, this paper considers localization for mobile sensors: when sensors\nare mobile, localization must be invoked periodically to enable the sensors to\ntrack their location. The higher the frequency of localization, the lower the\nerror introduced because of mobility. However, localization is a costly\noperation since it involves both communication and computation. In this paper,\nwe propose and investigate adaptive and predictive protocols that control the\nfrequency of localization based on sensor mobility behavior to reduce the\nenergy requirements for localization while bounding the localization error. We\nshow that such protocols can significantly reduce the localization energy\nwithout sacrificing accuracy (in fact, improving accuracy for most situations).\nUsing simulation and analysis we explore the tradeoff between energy efficiency\nand localization error due to mobility for several protocols."

    "summary": "There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the\ninterface level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is\ncurrently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not\nexamined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a\nnetwork-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that\nend. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter)\nare quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a\nconcern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic\nthat they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of\nredundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are\nimportant. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two\nkinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in\nconflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an\nalgorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and\nend systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to\nand from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe\neach path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can\nreduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while\npermitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links. We then show\nhow to enable efficient communication between monitors through the use of Bloom\nfilters."

    "summary": "The multiplication of architecture description languages, component models\nand platforms implies a serious dilemma for component based software\narchitects. On the one hand, they have to choose a language to describe\nconcrete configurations which will be automatically deployed on execution\nplatforms. On the other hand, they wish to capitalize their software\narchitectures independently of any description languages or platforms. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a multi personalities environment for the\nconfiguration and the deployment of component based applications. This\nenvironment is composed of a core capturing a canonical model of configuration\nand deployment, and a set of personalities tailored to languages and platforms.\nThis paper details the architecture of such an environment and describes the\npersonalities for the CORBA and Fractal component models."

    "summary": "Internet is growing at a fast pace. The link speeds are surging toward 40\nGbps with the emergence of faster link technologies. New applications are\ncoming up which require intelligent processing at the intermediate routers.\nSwitches and routers are becoming the bottlenecks in fast communication. On one\nhand faster links deliver more packets every second and on the other hand\nintelligent processing consumes more CPU cycles at the router. The conflicting\ngoals of providing faster but computationally expensive processing call for new\napproaches in designing routers.\n  This survey takes a look at the core functionalities, like packet\nclassification, buffer memory management, switch scheduling and output link\nscheduling performed by a router in its data path processing and discusses the\nalgorithms that aim to reduce the performance bound for these operations. An\nimportant requirement for the routers is to provide Quality of Service\nguarantees. We propose an algorithm to guarantee QoS in Input Queued Routers.\nThe hardware solution to speed up router operation was Application Specific\nIntegrated Circuits (ASICs). But the inherent inflexibility of the method is a\ndemerit as network standards and application requirements are constantly\nevolving, which seek a faster turnaround time to keep up with the changes. The\npromise of Network Processors (NP) is the flexibility of general-purpose\nprocessors together with the speed of ASICs. We will study the architectural\nchoices for the design of Network Processors and focus on some of the\ncommercially available NPs. There is a plethora of NP vendors in the market.\nThe discussion on the NP benchmarks sets the normalizing platform to evaluate\nthese NPs."

Most of these\nservices, like voice over WLAN, media streaming etc., generate delay and\nbandwidth sensitive traffic. These traffic flows require undisrupted network\nconnectivity with some QoS guarantees. Unfortunately, there is no adequate\nsupport built into these wireless LANs towards QoS provisioning. Further, the\nnetwork layer handoff latency incurred by mobile nodes in these wireless LANs\nis too high for real-time applications to function properly. In this paper, we\ndescribe a QoS mechanism, called Rether, to effectively support bandwidth\nguarantee on wireless LANs. Rether is designed to support the current wireless\nLAN technologies like 802.11b and 802.11a with a specific capability of being\ntailored for QoS oriented technology like 802.11e.

    "summary": "Software components turn out to be a convenient model to build complex\napplications for scientific computing and to run them on a computational grid.\nHowever, deploying complex, component-based applications in a grid environment\nis particularly arduous. To prevent the user from directly dealing with a large\nnumber of execution hosts and their heterogeneity within a grid, the\napplication deployment phase must be as automatic as possible. This paper\ndescribes an architecture for automatic deployment of component-based\napplications on computational grids. In the context of the CORBA Component\nModel (CCM), this paper details all the steps to achieve an automatic\ndeployment of components as well as the entities involved: a grid access\nmiddleware and its grid information service (like OGSI), a component deployment\nmodel, as specified by CCM, an enriched application description and a\ndeployment planner in order to select resources and map components onto\ncomputers."

We\npropose an integrated tool allowing system administrators to deploy critical\nsecurity updates on the fly on applications running remotly without end-user\nintervention. Our approach is based on an aspect weaving system, Arachne, that\ndynamicaly rewrites binary code. Hence updated applications are still running\nwhile they are updated. Our second tool Minerve integrates Arachne within the\nstandart updating process: Minerve takes a patch produced by dif and eventually\nbuilds a dynamic patch that can later be woven to update the application on the\nfly. In addition, Minerve allows to consult patches translated in a dedicated\nlanguage and hence eases auditing tasks."

We contribute a detailed mathematical\nanalysis of one of the heuristics and provide extensive simulation results on\nrandom graphs for both of them.

    "summary": "Network-Wide Broadcast (NWB) is a common operation in Mobile Ad hoc Networks\n(MANETs) used by routing protocols to discover routes and in group\ncommunication operations. NWB is commonly performed via flooding, which has\nbeen shown to be expensive in dense MANETs because of its high redundancy.\nSeveral efforts have targeted reducing the redundancy of floods. In this work,\nwe target another problem that can substantially impact the success of NWBs:\nsince MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, it is possible for critical\nrebroadcasts to be lost, leading to a significant drop in the node coverage.\nThis is especially true under heavy load and in sparse topologies. We show that\nthe techniques that target reducing the overhead of flooding, reduce its\ninherent redundancy and harm its reliability. In addition, we show that static\napproaches are more vulnerable to this problem. We then present a selective\nrebroadcast approach to improve the robustness of NWBs. We show that our\napproach leads to considerable improvement in NWB coverage relative to a\nrecently proposed solution to this problem, with a small increase in overhead.\nThe proposed approaches do not require proactive neighbor discovery and are\ntherefore resilient to mobility. Finally, the solution can be added to\nvirtually all NWB approaches to improve their reliability."

Solutions exist to reduce the amount of spam\nseen by end users, but cannot withstand sophisticated attacks. Worse yet, many\nwill occasionally misclassify and silently drop legitimate email. Spammers take\nadvantage of the near-zero cost of sending email to flood the network, knowing\nthat success even a tiny fraction of the time means a profit. End users,\nhowever, have proven unwilling to pay money to send email to friends and\nfamily.\n  We show that it is feasible to extend the existing mail system to reduce the\namount of unwanted email, without misclassifying email, and without charging\nwell-behaved users. We require that bulk email senders accurately classify each\nemail message they send as an advertisement with an area of interest or else be\ncharged a small negative incentive per message delivered.

A modified version of betweenness centrality is\nintroduced and shown to be very relevant for the respective modeling. The\ncalculated optimized network structures lead to a significant increase of the\nend-to-end throughput. The discussion of the resulting structural properties\nreveals that it will be almost impossible to construct these optimized\ntopologies in a technologically efficient distributive manner.

    "summary": "This paper is concerned with the characterization of the relationship between\ntopology and traffic dynamics. We use a model of network generation that allows\nthe transition from random to scale free networks. Specifically, we consider\nthree different topological types of network: random, scale-free with \\gamma =\n3, scale-free with \\gamma = 2. By using a novel LRD traffic generator, we\nobserve best performance, in terms of transmission rates and delivered packets,\nin the case of random networks. We show that, even if scale-free networks are\ncharacterized by shorter characteristic-path- length (the lower the exponent,\nthe lower the path-length), they show worst performances in terms of\ncommunication. We conjecture this could be explained in terms of changes in the\nload distribution, defined here as the number of shortest paths going through a\ngiven vertex. In fact, that distribu- tion is characterized by (i) a decreasing\nmean (ii) an increas- ing standard deviation, as the networks becomes\nscale-free (especially scale-free networks with low exponents). The use of a\ndegree-independent server also discriminates against a scale-free structure. As\na result, since the model is un- controlled, most packets will go through the\nsame vertices, favoring the onset of congestion."

    "summary": "Most MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork) research assumes idealized propagation\nmodels. Experimental results have shown significant divergence from simulation\nresults due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication\nchannels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol\nperformance. We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show\nthat its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that\neliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading.\nWe also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the\npresence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions\nbetween the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and\nmake observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example,\nthe criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link\nstatus but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on\nMAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route\nfailure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level\nbroadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze\nthese effects and outline preliminary solutions to them."

    "summary": "In large-scale wireless networks such as mobile ad hoc and sensor networks,\nefficient and robust service discovery and data-access mechanisms are both\nessential and challenging. Rendezvous-based mechanisms provide a valuable\nsolution for provisioning a wide range of services. In this paper, we describe\nRendezvous Regions (RRs) - a novel scalable rendezvous-based architecture for\nwireless networks. RR is a general architecture proposed for service location\nand bootstrapping in ad hoc networks, in addition to data-centric storage,\nconfiguration, and task assignment in sensor networks. In RR the network\ntopology is divided into geographical regions, where each region is responsible\nfor a set of keys representing the services or data of interest. Each key is\nmapped to a region based on a hash-table-like mapping scheme. A few elected\nnodes inside each region are responsible for maintaining the mapped\ninformation. The service or data provider stores the information in the\ncorresponding region and the seekers retrieve it from there. We run extensive\ndetailed simulations, and high-level simulations and analysis, to investigate\nthe design space, and study the architecture in various environments including\nnode mobility and failures. We evaluate it against other approaches to identify\nits merits and limitations. The results show high success rate and low overhead\neven with dynamics. RR scales to large number of nodes and is highly robust and\nefficient to node failures. It is also robust to node mobility and location\ninaccuracy with a significant advantage over point-based rendezvous mechanisms."

    "summary": "Geocasting is the delivery of packets to nodes within a certain geographic\narea. For many applications in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, geocasting\nis an important and frequent communication service. The challenging problem in\ngeocasting is distributing the packets to all the nodes within the geocast\nregion with high probability but with low overhead. According to our study we\nnotice a clear tradeoff between the proportion of nodes in the geocast region\nthat receive the packet and the overhead incurred by the geocast packet\nespecially at low densities and irregular distributions. We present two novel\nprotocols for geocasting that achieve high delivery rate and low overhead by\nutilizing the local location information of nodes to combine geographic routing\nmechanisms with region flooding. We show that the first protocol\nGeographic-Forwarding-Geocast (GFG) has close-to-minimum overhead in dense\nnetworks and that the second protocol Geographic-Forwarding-Perimeter-Geocast\n(GFPG) provides guaranteed delivery without global flooding or global network\ninformation even at low densities and with the existence of region gaps or\nobstacles. An adaptive version of the second protocol (GFPG*) has the desirable\nproperty of perfect delivery at all densities and close-to-minimum overhead at\nhigh densities. We evaluate our mechanisms and compare them using simulation to\nother proposed geocasting mechanisms. The results show the significant\nimprovement in delivery rate (up to 63% higher delivery percentage in low\ndensity networks) and reduction in overhead (up to 80% reduction) achieved by\nour mechanisms. We hope for our protocols to become building block mechanisms\nfor dependable sensor network architectures that require robust efficient\ngeocast services."

Many proposed models are based on\ntopologies derived from RouteViews BGP table dumps (BTDs). However, BTDs do not\ncapture all AS-links of the Internet topology and most importantly the number\nof the hidden AS-links is unknown, resulting in AS-graphs of questionable\nquality. As a first step to address this problem, we introduce a new\nAS-topology discovery methodology that results in more complete and accurate\ngraphs. Moreover, we use data available from existing measurement facilities,\ncircumventing the burden of additional measurement infrastructure. We deploy\nour methodology and construct an AS-topology that has at least 61.5% more\nAS-links than BTD-derived AS-topologies we examined.

    "summary": "We conduct the most comprehensive study of WLAN traces to date. Measurements\ncollected from four major university campuses are analyzed with the aim of\ndeveloping fundamental understanding of realistic user behavior in wireless\nnetworks. Both individual user and inter-node (group) behaviors are\ninvestigated and two classes of metrics are devised to capture the underlying\nstructure of such behaviors.\n  For individual user behavior we observe distinct patterns in which most users\nare 'on' for a small fraction of the time, the number of access points visited\nis very small and the overall on-line user mobility is quite low. We clearly\nidentify categories of heavy and light users. In general, users exhibit high\ndegree of similarity over days and weeks.\n  For group behavior, we define metrics for encounter patterns and friendship.\nSurprisingly, we find that a user, on average, encounters less than 6% of the\nnetwork user population within a month, and that encounter and friendship\nrelations are highly asymmetric. We establish that number of encounters follows\na biPareto distribution, while friendship indexes follow an exponential\ndistribution. We capture the encounter graph using a small world model, the\ncharacteristics of which reach steady state after only one day.\n  We hope for our study to have a great impact on realistic modeling of network\nusage and mobility patterns in wireless networks."

However, attacker traceback in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) is a\nchallenging problem due to the dynamic topology, and limited network resources.\nIt is especially difficult to trace back attacker(s) when they are moving to\navoid traceback. In this paper, we introduce the ATTENTION protocol framework,\nwhich pays special attention to MAC layer abnormal activity under attack.\nATTENTION consists of three classes, namely, coarse-grained traceback,\nfine-grained traceback and spatio-temporal fusion architecture. For\nenergy-efficient attacker searching in MANETs, we also utilize small-world\nmodel. Our simulation analysis shows 79% of success rate in DoS attacker\ntraceback with coarse-grained attack signature. In addition, with fine-grained\nattack signature, it shows 97% of success rate in DoS attacker traceback and\n83% of success rate in DDoS attacker traceback. We also show that ATTENTION has\nrobustness against node collusion and mobility."

However, by adapting the physical\nlayer channel coding, different rate-reliability tradeoffs can be achieved on\neach link and for each end user. Consider a network where each user has a\nutility function that depends on both signal quality and data rate, and each\nlink may provide a `fatter' (`thinner') information `pipe' by allowing a higher\n(lower) decoding error probability. We propose two distributed, pricing-based\nalgorithms to attain optimal rate-reliability tradeoff, with an interpretation\nthat each user provides its willingness to pay for reliability to the network\nand the network feeds back congestion prices to users. The proposed algorithms\nconverge to a tradeoff point between rate and reliability, which is proved to\nbe globally optimal for codes with sufficiently large codeword lengths and user\nutilities with sufficiently negative curvatures."

Worse, continuing empirical trends of the existing routing and\ntopology structure of the Internet are alarming: the foundational principles of\nthe current routing and addressing architecture are an inherently bad match for\nthe naturally evolving structure of Internet interdomain topology. We are\nfortunate that a sister discipline, theory of distributed computation, has\ndeveloped routing algorithms that offer promising potential for genuinely\nscalable routing on realistic Internet-like topologies. Indeed, there are many\nrecent breakthroughs in the area of compact routing, which has been shown to\ndrastically outperform, in terms of efficiency and scalability, even the\nboldest proposals developed in networking research. Many open questions remain,\nbut we believe the applicability of compact routing techniques to Internet\ninterdomain routing is a research area whose potential payoff for the future of\nnetworking is too high to ignore."

A well studied issue is the estimation of statistical\nparameters characterizing traffic self-similarity and LRD, such as the Hurst\nparameter H. In this paper, we propose to adapt the Modified Allan Variance\n(MAVAR), a time-domain quantity originally conceived to discriminate fractional\nnoise in frequency stability measurement, to estimate the Hurst parameter of\nLRD traffic traces and, more generally, to identify fractional noise components\nin network traffic. This novel method is validated by comparison to one of the\nbest techniques for analyzing self-similar and LRD traffic: the logscale\ndiagram based on wavelet analysis. Both methods are applied to pseudo-random\nLRD data series, generated with assigned values of H. The superior spectral\nsensitivity of MAVAR achieves outstanding accuracy in estimating H, even better\nthan the logscale method. The behaviour of MAVAR with most common deterministic\nsignals that yield nonstationarity in data under analysis is also studied.\nFinally, both techniques are applied to a real IP traffic trace, providing a\nsound example of the usefulness of MAVAR also in traffic characterization, to\ncomplement other established techniques as the logscale method."

    "summary": "Decoupling the permanent identifier of a node from the node's\ntopology-dependent address is a promising approach toward completely scalable\nself-organizing networks. A group of proposals that have adopted such an\napproach use the same structure to: address nodes, perform routing, and\nimplement location service. In this way, the consistency of the routing\nprotocol relies on the coherent sharing of the addressing space among all nodes\nin the network. Such proposals use a logical tree-like structure where routes\nin this space correspond to routes in the physical level. The advantage of\ntree-like spaces is that it allows for simple address assignment and\nmanagement. Nevertheless, it has low route selection flexibility, which results\nin low routing performance and poor resilience to failures. In this paper, we\npropose to increase the number of paths using incomplete hypercubes. The design\nof more complex structures, like multi-dimensional Cartesian spaces, improves\nthe resilience and routing performance due to the flexibility in route\nselection. We present a framework for using hypercubes to implement indirect\nrouting. This framework allows to give a solution adapted to the dynamics of\nthe network, providing a proactive and reactive routing protocols, our major\ncontributions. We show that, contrary to traditional approaches, our proposal\nsupports more dynamic networks and is more robust to node failures."

    "summary": "Current directions in network routing research have not kept pace with the\nlatest developments in network architectures, such as peer-to-peer networks,\nsensor networks, ad-hoc wireless networks, and overlay networks. A common\ncharacteristic among all of these new technologies is the presence of highly\ndynamic network topologies. Currently deployed single-path routing protocols\ncannot adequately cope with this dynamism, and existing multi-path algorithms\nmake trade-offs which lead to less than optimal performance on these networks.\nThis drives the need for routing protocols designed with the unique\ncharacteristics of these networks in mind.\n  In this paper we propose the notion of reachability routing as a solution to\nthe challenges posed by routing on such dynamic networks. In particular, our\nformulation of reachability routing provides cost-sensitive multi-path\nforwarding along with loop avoidance within the confines of the Internet\nProtocol (IP) architecture. This is achieved through the application of\nreinforcement learning within a probabilistic routing framework. Following an\nexplanation of our design decisions and a description of the algorithm, we\nprovide an evaluation of the performance of the algorithm on a variety of\nnetwork topologies. The results show consistently superior performance compared\nto other reinforcement learning based routing algorithms."

    "summary": "Geographical routing protocols have several desirable features for use in ad\nhoc and sensor networks but are susceptible to voids and localization errors.\nVirtual coordinate systems are an alternative solution to geographically based\nrouting protocols that works by overlaying a coordinate system on the sensors\nrelative to well chosen reference points. VC is resilient to localization\nerrors; however, we show that it is vulnerable to different forms of the void\nproblem and have no viable complementary approach to overcome them.\nSpecifically, we show that there are instances when packets reach nodes with no\nviable next hop nodes in the forwarding set. In addition, it is possible for\nnodes with the same coordinates to arise at different points in the network in\nthe presence of voids. This paper identifies and analyzes these problems. It\nalso compares several existing routing protocols based on Virtual Coordinate\nsystems. Finally, it presents a new routing algorithm that uses backtracking to\novercome voids to achieve high connectivity in the greedy phase, higher overall\npath quality and more resilience to localization errors.

However, routing benefits considerably if one\ncan take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. This paper addresses\nthis problem with a generic algorithm based on the use of a high-dimensional\nEuclidean space, that we call MobySpace, constructed upon nodes' mobility\npatterns. We provide here an analysis and the large scale evaluation of this\nrouting scheme in the context of ambient networking by replaying real mobility\ntraces. The specific MobySpace evaluated is based on the frequency of visit of\nnodes for each possible location. We show that the MobySpace can achieve good\nperformance compared to that of the other algorithms we implemented, especially\nwhen we perform routing on the nodes that have a high connection time.

    "summary": "We study in this paper the integration of elastic and streaming traffic on a\nsame link in an IP network. We are specifically interested in the computation\nof the mean bit rate obtained by a data transfer. For this purpose, we consider\nthat the bit rate offered by streaming traffic is low, of the order of\nmagnitude of a small parameter \\eps \\ll 1 and related to an auxiliary\nstationary Markovian process (X(t)). Under the assumption that data transfers\nare exponentially distributed, arrive according to a Poisson process, and share\nthe available bandwidth according to the ideal processor sharing discipline, we\nderive the mean bit rate of a data transfer as a power series expansion in\n\\eps. Since the system can be described by means of an M/M/1 queue with a\ntime-varying server rate, which depends upon the parameter \\eps and process\n(X(t)), the key issue is to compute an expansion of the area swept under the\noccupation process of this queue in a busy period. We obtain closed formulas\nfor the power series expansion in \\eps of the mean bit rate, which allow us to\nverify the validity of the so-called reduced service rate at the first order.\nThe second order term yields more insight into the negative impact of the\nvariability of streaming flows."

    "summary": "In the past few years, the network measurement community has been interested\nin the problem of internet topology discovery using a large number (hundreds or\nthousands) of measurement monitors. The standard way to obtain information\nabout the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number\nof monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of\nmonitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up\nthe number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to\nthe monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and\nclose to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a given\ndestination. In prior work, authors of this report proposed Doubletree, an\nalgorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the load on the\nnetwork, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost as\nmany nodes and links as standard approaches based on traceroute. This report\npresents our open-source and freely downloadable implementation of Doubletree\nin a tool we call traceroute@home. We describe the deployment and validation of\ntraceroute@home on the PlanetLab testbed and we report on the lessons learned\nfrom this experience. We discuss how traceroute@home can be developed further\nand discuss ideas for future improvements."

In this work we introduce novel heuristics for inferring AS\nrelationships. Our heuristics improve upon previous works in several technical\naspects, which we outline in detail and demonstrate with several examples.\nSeeking to increase the value and reliability of our inference results, we then\nfocus on validation of inferred AS relationships. We perform a survey with ASs'\nnetwork administrators to collect information on the actual connectivity and\npolicies of the surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new\nAS relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we\ncorrectly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer (p2p), and\n90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then cross-compare the\nreported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data contained in BGP tables.\nWe find that BGP tables miss up to 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the\nsurveyed ASs. The majority of the missing links are of the p2p type, which\nhighlights the limitations of present measuring techniques to capture links of\nthis type. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and practically\nuseful for the community, we open an AS relationship repository where we\narchive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly available the complete Internet\nAS-level topology annotated with AS relationship information for every pair of\nAS neighbors."

    "summary": "Positioning systems in self-organizing networks generally rely on\nmeasurements such as delay and received signal strength, which may be difficult\nto obtain and often require dedicated equipment. An alternative to such\napproaches is to use simple connectivity information, that is, the presence or\nabsence of a link between any pair of nodes, and to extend it to hop-counts, in\norder to obtain an approximate coordinate system. Such an approximation is\nsufficient for a large number of applications, such as routing. In this paper,\nwe propose Jumps, a positioning system for those self-organizing networks in\nwhich other types of (exact) positioning systems cannot be used or are deemed\nto be too costly. Jumps builds a multiple coordinate system based solely on\nnodes neighborhood knowledge. Jumps is interesting in the context of wireless\nsensor networks, as it neither requires additional embedded equipment nor\nrelies on any nodes capabilities. While other approaches use only three\nhop-count measurements to infer the position of a node, Jumps uses an arbitrary\nnumber. We observe that an increase in the number of measurements leads to an\nimprovement in the localization process, without requiring a high dense\nenvironment. We show through simulations that Jumps, when compared with\nexisting approaches, reduces the number of nodes sharing the same coordinates,\nwhich paves the way for functions such as position-based routing."

Distributed network algorithms\nwhere joint power control and routing are performed on a node-by-node basis are\npresented.

Next, we study refinements of the algorithms for more accurate link\ncapacity models, and extend the results to wireless networks where the\nphysical-layer achievable rate region is given by an arbitrary convex set, and\nthe link costs are strictly quasiconvex.

    "summary": "Recent proposals in multicast overlay construction have demonstrated the\nimportance of exploiting underlying network topology. However, these\ntopology-aware proposals often rely on incremental and periodic refinements to\nimprove the system performance. These approaches are therefore neither\nscalable, as they induce high communication cost due to refinement overhead,\nnor efficient because long convergence time is necessary to obtain a stabilized\nstructure. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable locating algorithm that\ngradually directs newcomers to their a set of their closest nodes without\ninducing high overhead. On the basis of this locating process, we build a\nrobust and scalable topology-aware clustered hierarchical overlay scheme,\ncalled LCC. We conducted both simulations and PlanetLab experiments to evaluate\nthe performance of LCC. Results show that the locating process entails modest\nresources in terms of time and bandwidth.

However, the\nperformance of these protocols is impacted by physical voids, and localization\nerrors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an\nalternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that\nnaturally routes around physical voids. However, we show that VCS is vulnerable\nto different forms of the void problem and the performance of greedy routing on\nVCS is worse than that of geographic forwarding. We show that these anomalies\nare due to the integral nature of VCS, which causes quantization noise in the\nestimate of connectivity and node location. We propose an aligned virtual\ncoordinate system (AVCS) on which the greedy routing success can be\nsignificantly improved. With our approach, and for the first time, we show that\ngreedy routing on VCS out-performs that on physical coordinate systems even in\nthe absence of localization errors. We compare AVCS against some of the most\npopular geographical routing protocols both on physical coordinate system and\nthe virtual coordinate systems and show that AVCS significantly improves\nperformance over the best known solutions."

It is widely used as an engineering tool, and also as a scientific\ntool, such as for discovery of the network topology at the IP level. In prior\nwork, authors on this technical report have shown how to improve the efficiency\nof route tracing from multiple cooperating monitors. However, it is not unusual\nfor a route tracing monitor to operate in isolation. Somewhat different\nstrategies are required for this case, and this report is the first systematic\nstudy of those requirements. Standard traceroute is inefficient when used\nrepeatedly towards multiple destinations, as it repeatedly probes the same\ninterfaces close to the source. Others have recognized this inefficiency and\nhave proposed tracing backwards from the destinations and stopping probing upon\nencounter with a previously-seen interface. One of this technical report's\ncontributions is to quantify for the first time the efficiency of this\napproach. Another contribution is to describe the effect of non-responding\ndestinations on this efficiency. Since a large portion of destination machines\ndo not reply to probe packets, backwards probing from the destination is often\ninfeasible. We propose an algorithm to tackle non-responding destinations, and\nwe find that our algorithm can strongly decrease probing redundancy at the cost\nof a small reduction in node and link discovery."

    "summary": "In grid networks, distributed resources are interconnected by wide area\nnetwork to support compute and data-intensive applications, which require\nreliable and efficient transfer of gigabits (even terabits) of data. Different\nfrom best-effort traffic in Internet, bulk data transfer in grid requires\nbandwidth reservation as a fundamental service. Existing reservation schemes\nsuch as RSVP are designed for real-time traffic specified by reservation rate,\ntransfer start time but with unknown lifetime. In comparison, bulk data\ntransfer requests are defined in terms of volume and deadline, which provide\nmore information, and allow more flexibility in reservation schemes, i.e.,\ntransfer start time can be flexibly chosen, and reservation for a single\nrequest can be divided into multiple intervals with different reservation\nrates. We define a flexible reservation framework using time-rate function\nalgebra, and identify a series of practical reservation scheme families with\nincreasing generality and potential performance, namely, FixTime-FixRate,\nFixTime-FlexRate, FlexTime-FlexRate, and Multi-Interval. Simple heuristics are\nused to select representative scheme from each family for performance\ncomparison. Simulation results show that the increasing flexibility can\npotentially improve system performance, minimizing both blocking probability\nand mean flow time. We also discuss the distributed implementation of proposed\nframework."

    "summary": "Where distributed agents must share voluminous set membership information,\nBloom filters provide a compact, though lossy, way for them to do so. Numerous\nrecent networking papers have examined the trade-offs between the bandwidth\nconsumed by the transmission of Bloom filters, and the error rate, which takes\nthe form of false positives, and which rises the more the filters are\ncompressed. In this paper, we introduce the retouched Bloom filter (RBF), an\nextension that makes the Bloom filter more flexible by permitting the removal\nof selected false positives at the expense of generating random false\nnegatives. We analytically show that RBFs created through a random process\nmaintain an overall error rate, expressed as a combination of the false\npositive rate and the false negative rate, that is equal to the false positive\nrate of the corresponding Bloom filters. We further provide some simple\nheuristics and improved algorithms that decrease the false positive rate more\nthan than the corresponding increase in the false negative rate, when creating\nRBFs. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of an RBF over a Bloom filter in a\ndistributed network topology measurement application, where information about\nlarge stop sets must be shared among route tracing monitors."

In order to enable seamless roaming it is necessary to\nminimize the impact of the vertical handoffs. Localized mobility management\nschemes such as FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 do not provide sufficient handoff\nperformance, since they have been designed for horizontal handoffs. In this\npaper, we propose the SafetyNet protocol, which allows a Mobile Node to perform\nseamless vertical handoffs. Further, we propose a handoff timing algorithm\nwhich allows a Mobile Node to delay or even completely avoid upward vertical\nhandoffs. We implement the SafetyNet protocol and compare its performance with\nthe Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 protocol in our wireless test bed and\nanalyze the results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed\nSafetyNet protocol can provide an improvement of up to 95% for TCP performance\nin vertical handoffs, when compared with FMIPv6 and an improvement of 64% over\nFMIPv6 with bicasting. We use numerical analysis of the protocol to show that\nits signaling and data transmission overhead is comparable to Fast Mobile IPv6\nand significantly smaller than that of FMIPv6 with bicasting."

The corresponding Dynamic Programming\nequations are solved using Value Iteration method and a stationary optimal\npolicy with neither convex nor concave type switching curve structure is\nobtained.

These policies significantly improve over a\nmodified threshold policy in [1] by about 17% in response time metrics. We\nfurther propose and evaluate a new improved switching policy that we call\nFS-DCH (at-least flow-size threshold on DCH) policy. This policy is biased\ntowards short TCP flows of few packets and is thus a cross-layer policy that\nimproves the performance of TCP by giving priority to the initial few packets\nof a flow on the fast DCH channel. Extensive simulation results confirm this\nimprovement for the case when number of TCP connections is low."

Two such strategies have been introduced by the\nBitTorrent protocol: the rarest first and choke algorithms. Whereas it is\ncommonly admitted that BitTorrent performs well, recent studies have proposed\nthe replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms in order to improve\nefficiency and fairness. In this paper, we use results from real experiments to\nadvocate that the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms cannot\nbe justified in the context of peer-to-peer file replication in the Internet.\nWe instrumented a BitTorrent client and ran experiments on real torrents with\ndifferent characteristics. Our experimental evaluation is peer oriented,\ninstead of tracker oriented, which allows us to get detailed information on all\nexchanged messages and protocol events. We go beyond the mere observation of\nthe good efficiency of both algorithms. We show that the rarest first algorithm\nguarantees close to ideal diversity of the pieces among peers. In particular,\non our experiments, replacing the rarest first algorithm with source or network\ncoding solutions cannot be justified. We also show that the choke algorithm in\nits latest version fosters reciprocation and is robust to free riders. In\nparticular, the choke algorithm is fair and its replacement with a bit level\ntit-for-tat solution is not appropriate. Finally, we identify new areas of\nimprovements for efficient peer-to-peer file replication protocols."

    "summary": "Most wireless terrestrial networks are designed based on the assumption that\nthe nodes are deployed on a two-dimensional (2D) plane. However, this 2D\nassumption is not valid in underwater, atmospheric, or space communications. In\nfact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints\nat the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the\ndesign of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D\nnetworks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture\nrequired centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D\ncounterparts are trivial to solve. In this paper, we consider the coverage and\nconnectivity issues of 3D networks, where the goal is to find a node placement\nstrategy with 100% sensing coverage of a 3D space, while minimizing the number\nof nodes required for surveillance. Our results indicate that the use of the\nVoronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results\nin the best strategy. In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the\ntransmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to\nmaintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142\nand 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy\nor a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the\nrequired number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron\nplacement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number\nof nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy. We verify by\nsimulation that our placement strategies indeed guarantee ubiquitous coverage.\nWe believe that our approach and our results presented in this paper could be\nused for extending the processes of 2D network design to 3D networks."

Routing protocols based on a self-organized\nstructure have been studied principally for the robustness and the scalability\nthey provide. On the other hand, self-organization schemes may decrease the\nnetwork capacity since they concentrate the traffic on privileged links. This\npaper presents four models for evaluating the capacity of a routing schemes on\n802.11 like networks. Our approach consists in modeling the radio resource\nsharing principles of 802.11 like MAC protocols as a set of linear constraints.\nWe have implemented two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes\nhave a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the\nradio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarii of\nspatial re-utilization of the medium, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound\non the network capacity for each fairness case. Our models are independent of\nthe routing protocols and provide therefore a relevant framework for their\ncomparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of the well-known\nshortest path base flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized\nstructure approaches, VSR, and Wu & Li's protocols. This study concludes on the\nrelevance of self-organized approaches from the network capacity point of view."

Low makespan is vital for achieving high throughput with a TCP-like\nwindow based sending scheme. In hierarchical reliable multicast methods, the\nnumber of repair servers and their locations influence the makespan. In this\npaper we propose a new method to decide the locations of repair servers that\ncan reduce the makespan in hierarchical reliable multicast networks. Our method\nhas a formulation based on mixed integer programming to analyze the makespan\nminimization problem. A notable aspect of the formulation is that heterogeneous\nlinks and packet losses are taken into account in the formulation. Three\ndifferent heuristics are presented to find the locations of repair servers in\nreasonable time in the formulation. Through simulations, three heuristics are\ncarefully analyzed and compared on networks with different sizes. We also\nevaluate our proposals on PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast) reliable multicast\nprotocol using ns-2 simulation.

In this\npaper an overall analysis of the networked control system is presented. First,\nthe procedure of obtaining the upper bound delay value for packet transmission\nin the switched Ethernet network is presented. Next, the obtained delay\nestimate is utilised in delay compensation for improving the Quality of\nPerformance (QoP) of the control systems. The presented upper bound delay\nalgorithm applies ideas from network calculus theory. For the improvement of\nQoP, two delay compensation strategies, the Smith predictor based and the\nrobust control based delay compensation strategies, are presented and compared."

    "summary": "High-speed photonic switching networks can switch optical signals at the rate\nof several terabits per second. However, they suffer from an intrinsic\ncrosstalk problem when two optical signals cross at the same switch element. To\navoid crosstalk, active connections must be node-disjoint in the switching\nnetwork. In this paper, we propose a sequence of decomposition and merge\noperations, called conjugate transformation, performed on each switch element\nto tackle this problem. The network resulting from this transformation is\ncalled conjugate network. By using the numbering-schemes of networks, we prove\nthat if the route assignments in the original network are link-disjoint, their\ncorresponding ones in the conjugate network would be node-disjoint. Thus,\ntraditional nonblocking switching networks can be transformed into\ncrosstalk-free optical switches in a routine manner. Furthermore, we show that\ncrosstalk-free multicast switches can also be obtained from existing\nnonblocking multicast switches via the same conjugate transformation."

Once the prototype has been\nextensively tested and thoroughly validated, and its functional design tuned\naccordingly, it is then ready for implementation. Prawn facilitates prototype\ndevelopment by providing: (i) a set of building blocks that implement common\nfunctions needed by a wide range of wireless protocols (e.g., neighbor\ndiscovery, link quality assessment, message transmission and reception), and\n(ii) an API that allows protocol designers to access Prawn primitives. We show\nthrough a number of case studies how Prawn supports prototyping as part of\nprotocol design and, as a result of enabling deployment and testing under\nreal-world scenarios, how Prawn provides useful feedback on protocol operation\nand performance."

The overlay abstraction introduces several benefits of\nwhich mobility and communication across heterogenous network structures are of\ninterest to this paper. We present implementations of several components and\nprotocols including gateways, Agents and the Open Device Access Protocol. Our\npresent identification network implementation exploits the current\nimplementation of the Handle System through the use of distributed, global and\npersistent identifiers called handles. Handles are used to identify and locate\ndevices and services abstracting any physical location or network association\nfrom the communicating ends. A communication framework is finally demonstrated\nthat would allow for mobile devices on the public Internet to have persistent\nidentifiers and thus be persistently accessible either directly or indirectly.\nThis application expands IP inter-operability beyond its current boundaries."

To avoid data loss when losing or\ndestroying a mobile device like a PDA or a cell phone, data is usually\nbacked-up to a fixed station. However, in the time between the last backup and\nthe failure, important data can have been produced and then lost. To handle\nthis issue, we propose a transparent collaborative backup system. Indeed, by\nsaving data on other mobile devices between two connections to a global\ninfrastructure, we can resist to such scenarios.

We present the first experimental\ninvestigation of the peer selection strategy of the popular BitTorrent protocol\nin an instrumented private torrent. By observing the decisions of more than 40\nnodes, we validate three BitTorrent properties that, though widely believed to\nhold, have not been demonstrated experimentally. These include the clustering\nof similar-bandwidth peers, the effectiveness of BitTorrent's sharing\nincentives, and the peers' high average upload utilization. In addition, our\nresults show that BitTorrent's new choking algorithm in seed state provides\nuniform service to all peers, and that an underprovisioned initial seed leads\nto the absence of peer clustering and less effective sharing incentives. Based\non our observations, we provide guidelines for seed provisioning by content\nproviders, and discuss a tracker protocol extension that addresses an\nidentified limitation of the protocol."

    "summary": "It is widely believed that the Internet's AS-graph degree distribution obeys\na power-law form. Most of the evidence showing the power-law distribution is\nbased on BGP data. However, it was recently argued that since BGP collects data\nin a tree-like fashion, it only produces a sample of the degree distribution,\nand this sample may be biased. This argument was backed by simulation data and\nmathematical analysis, which demonstrated that under certain conditions a tree\nsampling procedure can produce an artificail power-law in the degree\ndistribution. Thus, although the observed degree distribution of the AS-graph\nfollows a power-law, this phenomenon may be an artifact of the sampling\nprocess. In this work we provide some evidence to the contrary. We show, by\nanalysis and simulation, that when the underlying graph degree distribution\nobeys a power-law with an exponent larger than 2, a tree-like sampling process\nproduces a negligible bias in the sampled degree distribution. Furthermore,\nrecent data collected from the DIMES project, which is not based on BGP\nsampling, indicates that the underlying AS-graph indeed obeys a power-law\ndegree distribution with an exponent larger than 2. By combining this empirical\ndata with our analysis, we conclude that the bias in the degree distribution\ncalculated from BGP data is negligible."

    "summary": "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a major problem in the\nInternet today. In one form of a DDoS attack, a large number of compromised\nhosts send unwanted traffic to the victim, thus exhausting the resources of the\nvictim and preventing it from serving its legitimate clients. One of the main\nmechanisms that have been proposed to deal with DDoS is filtering, which allows\nrouters to selectively block unwanted traffic. Given the magnitude of DDoS\nattacks and the high cost of filters in the routers today, the successful\nmitigation of a DDoS attack using filtering crucially depends on the efficient\nallocation of filtering resources. In this paper, we consider a single router,\ntypically the gateway of the victim, with a limited number of available\nfilters. We study how to optimally allocate filters to attack sources, or\nentire domains of attack sources, so as to maximize the amount of good traffic\npreserved, under a constraint on the number of filters. We formulate the\nproblem as an optimization problem and solve it optimally using dynamic\nprogramming, study the properties of the optimal allocation, experiment with a\nsimple heuristic and evaluate our solutions for a range of realistic\nattack-scenarios. First, we look at a single-tier where the collateral damage\nis high due to the filtering at the granularity of domains. Second, we look at\nthe two-tier problem where we have an additional constraint on the number of\nfilters and the filtering is performed on the granularity of attackers and\ndomains."

    "summary": "It is now commonly accepted that the unit disk graph used to model the\nphysical layer in wireless networks does not reflect real radio transmissions,\nand that the lognormal shadowing model better suits to experimental\nsimulations. Previous work on realistic scenarios focused on unicast, while\nbroadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from\nunicast case. Therefore, broadcast protocols must be adapted in order to still\nbe efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the\nwell-known multipoint relay protocol (MPR). In the latter, each node has to\nchoose a set of neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2-hop\nneighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original method\nprovided to select the set of relays does not give good results with the\nrealistic model. We also provide three new heuristics in replacement and their\nperformances which demonstrate that they better suit to the considered model.\nThe first one maximizes the probability of correct reception between the node\nand the considered relays multiplied by their coverage in the 2-hop\nneighborhood. The second one replaces the coverage by the average of the\nprobabilities of correct reception between the considered neighbor and the\n2-hop neighbors it covers. Finally, the third heuristic keeps the same concept\nas the second one, but tries to maximize the coverage level of the 2-hop\nneighborhood: 2-hop neighbors are still being considered as uncovered while\ntheir coverage level is not higher than a given coverage threshold, many\nneighbors may thus be selected to cover the same 2-hop neighbors."

In this work, we propose to solve these problems by\nconnecting two or more local-area networks together via a Redundant Array of\nInternet Links (or RAIL) and by proactively replicating each packet over these\nlinks. In that sense, RAIL is for networks what RAID (Redundant Array of\nInexpensive Disks) was for disks. In this paper, we describe the RAIL approach,\npresent our prototype (called the RAILedge), and evaluate its performance.\nFirst, we demonstrate that using multiple Internet links significantly improves\nthe end-to-end performance in terms of network-level as well as\napplication-level metrics for Voice-over-IP and TCP. Second, we show that a\ndelay padding mechanism is needed to complement RAIL when there is significant\ndelay disparity between the paths. Third, we show that two paths provide most\nof the benefit, if carefully managed. Finally, we discuss a RAIL-network\narchitecture, where RAILedges make use of path redundancy, route control and\napplication-specific mechanisms, to improve WAN performance."

The dynamic changes in peer degree are studied as a time series in two\ndimensional phase space which is defined as the number of connected leaves and\nthe number of connected ultras. The reported degrees are concentrated in three\nspecial Software related regions that we named as Ultra Stable Region, Leaf\nStable Region and Transition Belt. A method is proposed to classify degree\ntraces in phase space into different classes. Connection churn then is studied\nalong with the churn in degree. It shows that the topological structure of\nGnutella is rather stable in its connection degree but not the topology itself.\nThe connection drop rate is estimated and the live time of connections is\ninferred afterwards. M/M/m/m loss queue system is introduced to model the\ndegree keeping process in Gnutella. This model revealed that the degree stable\nis ensured by large new connection efforts. In other words the stable in\ntopological structure of Gnutella is a results of essential unstable in its\ntopology. That opens a challenge to the basic design philosophy of this\nnetwork."

An attack on a network can be performed as an intrusion in the network\nor as sending a lot of fault information and disturbing the network flow. Such\nattacks can be detected by modelling the traffic flows in a network, by\ncounting the source destination packets and even by measuring counts over time\nand by drawing a comparison with this 'time series' for instance."

    "summary": "We address the design of opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) strategies that\nallow secondary users to independently search for and exploit instantaneous\nspectrum availability. Integrated in the joint design are three basic\ncomponents: a spectrum sensor that identifies spectrum opportunities, a sensing\nstrategy that determines which channels in the spectrum to sense, and an access\nstrategy that decides whether to access based on imperfect sensing outcomes.\n  We formulate the joint PHY-MAC design of OSA as a constrained partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP). Constrained POMDPs generally\nrequire randomized policies to achieve optimality, which are often intractable.\nBy exploiting the rich structure of the underlying problem, we establish a\nseparation principle for the joint design of OSA. This separation principle\nreveals the optimality of myopic policies for the design of the spectrum sensor\nand the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore,\ndecoupling the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor\nand the access strategy, the separation principle reduces the constrained POMDP\nto an unconstrained one, which admits deterministic optimal policies. Numerical\nexamples are provided to study the design tradeoffs, the interaction between\nthe spectrum sensor and the sensing and access strategies, and the robustness\nof the ensuing design to model mismatch."

This\npaper proposes to look forward to the results obtained in terms of TCP\nthroughput guarantee in the DiffServ Assured Forwarding (DiffServ/AF) service\nand to present an overview of the different proposals to solve the problem. It\nhas been demonstrated that the standardized IETF DiffServ conditioners such as\nthe token bucket color marker and the time sliding window color maker were not\ngood TCP traffic descriptors. Starting with this point, several propositions\nhave been made and most of them presents new marking schemes in order to\nreplace or improve the traditional token bucket color marker. The main problem\nis that TCP congestion control is not designed to work with the AF service.\nIndeed, both mechanisms are antagonists. TCP has the property to share in a\nfair manner the bottleneck bandwidth between flows while DiffServ network\nprovides a level of service controllable and predictable. In this paper, we\nbuild a classification of all the propositions made during these last years and\ncompare them. As a result, we will see that these conditioning schemes can be\nseparated in three sets of action level and that the conditioning at the\nnetwork edge level is the most accepted one.

One of the main\ngoals to study BPS is the possibility of its application in size-based\nscheduling, which is used in differentiation between Short and Long flows in\nthe Internet. In the case of hyper-exponential service time distribution we\nfind an analytical expression of the expected conditional response time for the\nBPS queue. We show, that the expected conditional response time is a concave\nfunction of the service time. We apply the received results to the Two Level\nProcessor-Sharing (TLPS) model with hyper-exponential service time distribution\nand find the expression of the expected response time for the TLPS model. TLPS\nscheduling discipline can be applied to size-based differentiation in TCP/IP\nnetworks and Web server request handling."

We build upon recent work, which demonstrated that network\ncoding can increase throughput over a broadcast medium, by mixing packets from\ndifferent flows into a single packet, thus increasing the information content\nper transmission. Our key insight is that, when the transmitted flows are video\nstreams, network codes should be selected so as to maximize not only the\nnetwork throughput but also the video quality. We propose video-aware\nopportunistic network coding schemes that take into account both (i) the\ndecodability of network codes by several receivers and (ii) the importance and\ndeadlines of video packets.

    "summary": "Multicast is a central challenge for emerging multi-hop wireless\narchitectures such as wireless mesh networks, because of its substantial cost\nin terms of bandwidth. In this report, we study one specific case of multicast:\nbroadcasting, sending data from one source to all nodes, in a multi-hop\nwireless network. The broadcast we focus on is based on network coding, a\npromising avenue for reducing cost; previous work of ours showed that the\nperformance of network coding with simple heuristics is asymptotically optimal:\neach transmission is beneficial to nearly every receiver. This is for\nhomogenous and large networks of the plan. But for small, sparse or for\ninhomogeneous networks, some additional heuristics are required. This report\nproposes such additional new heuristics (for selecting rates) for broadcasting\nwith network coding. Our heuristics are intended to use only simple local\ntopology information. We detail the logic of the heuristics, and with\nexperimental results, we illustrate the behavior of the heuristics, and\ndemonstrate their excellent performance."

We start by analyzing how the overlay\nproperties impact the efficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer\nset size (i.e., average number of neighbors), the time for a peer to reach its\nmaximum peer set size, and the diameter of the overlay. In particular, we show\nthat the later a peer arrives in a torrent, the longer it takes to reach its\nmaximum peer set size. Then, we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer set\nsize, the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer, and the number of\nNATed peers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a\nrobust overlay, but that this overlay is not a random graph. In particular, the\nconnectivity of a peer to its neighbors depends on its arriving order in the\ntorrent. We also show that a large number of NATed peers significantly\ncompromise the robustness of the overlay to attacks. Finally, we evaluate the\nimpact of peer exchange on the overlay properties, and we show that it\ngenerates a chain-like overlay with a large diameter, which will adversely\nimpact the efficiency of large torrents."

Updating the software code automatically on a huge number of\nsensors is a tremendous task, as ''by hand'' updates can obviously not be\nconsidered, especially when all participating sensors are embedded on mobile\nentities. In this paper, we investigate an approach to automatically update\nsoftware in mobile sensor-based application when no localization mechanism is\navailable. We leverage the peer-to-peer cooperation paradigm to achieve a good\ntrade-off between reliability and scalability of code propagation. More\nspecifically, we present the design and evaluation of GCP ({\\emph Gossip-based\nCode Propagation}), a distributed software update algorithm for mobile wireless\nsensor networks. GCP relies on two different mechanisms (piggy-backing and\nforwarding control) to improve significantly the load balance without\nsacrificing on the propagation speed. We compare GCP against traditional\ndissemination approaches. Simulation results based on both synthetic and\nrealistic workloads show that GCP achieves a good convergence speed while\nbalancing the load evenly between sensors."

    "summary": "This paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm within a\nwavelet domain Bayesian framework for semi-blind channel estimation of\nmultiband OFDM based UWB communications. A prior distribution is chosen for the\nwavelet coefficients of the unknown channel impulse response in order to model\na sparseness property of the wavelet representation. This prior yields, in\nmaximum a posteriori estimation, a thresholding rule within the EM algorithm.\nWe particularly focus on reducing the number of estimated parameters by\niteratively discarding ``unsignificant'' wavelet coefficients from the\nestimation process. Simulation results using UWB channels issued from both\nmodels and measurements show that under sparsity conditions, the proposed\nalgorithm outperforms pilot based channel estimation in terms of mean square\nerror and bit error rate and enhances the estimation accuracy with less\ncomputational complexity than traditional semi-blind methods."

We use analytic\narguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology\nchange cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also\nemploy simulations to confirm that logarithmic routing table size scaling gets\nbroken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular\nlocator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the\npresence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic\nfindings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of\nassumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a\nrouting architecture that would be able to scale ``indefinitely.''"

    "summary": "Each node in a wireless multi-hop network can adjust the power level at which\nit transmits and thus change the topology of the network to save energy by\nchoosing the neighbors with which it directly communicates. Many previous\nalgorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each\nnode to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the\ndistance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of\nlocation-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments\nwhere the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in\ndistance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal\npaths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be\nline-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring\nnode. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple\ndistributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while\npreserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of\nany location-based information. We show that the STC algorithm achieves the\nsame or better order of communication and computational complexity when\ncompared to other known algorithms that also preserve connectivity without the\nuse of location-based information. We also present a detailed simulation-based\ncomparative analysis of the energy savings and interference reduction achieved\nby the algorithms. The results show that, in spite of not incurring a higher\ncommunication or computational complexity, the STC algorithm performs better\nthan other algorithms in uniform wireless environments and especially better\nwhen path loss characteristics are non-uniform."

    "summary": "We propose Otiy, a node-centric location service that limits the impact of\nlocation updates generate by mobile nodes in IEEE802.11-based wireless mesh\nnetworks. Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the\nlocator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's\nlocation. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no\nclue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the\nsource/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and\nbandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy\nthat identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a\ndestination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending\non the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns\nof nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,\ndefined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent\nnodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying\nwhich locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a\nperiod of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of\nexact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases\nby 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what\nthey know about the network."

Using this ccdf, one can\naccurately find the probability that the network achieves a given lifetime. It\nis also shown that when the number of sensors, $N$, is large, with an error\nexponentially decaying with $N$, one can predict whether or not a certain\nlifetime can be achieved.

For the\nequilibrium synchronization case, it is shown that there is a close\nrelationship between the L2 norm of the error vector e and the H2 norm of the\ntransfer function G of the linearized network about the equilibrium point.\nConsequently, the effect of the network coupling topology on the H2 norm of the\ntransfer function G is analyzed.

    "summary": "For most wireless services with variable rate transmission, both average rate\nand rate oscillation are important performance metrics. The traditional\nperformance criterion, utility of average transmission rate, boosts the average\nrate but also results in high rate oscillations. We introduce a utility\nfunction of instantaneous transmission rates. It is capable of facilitating the\nresource allocation with flexible combinations of average rate and rate\noscillation. Based on the new utility, we consider the time and power\nallocation in a time-shared wireless network. Two adaptation policies are\ndeveloped, namely, time sharing (TS) and joint time sharing and power control\n(JTPC). An extension to quantized time sharing with limited channel feedback\n(QTSL) for practical systems is also discussed. Simulation results show that by\ncontrolling the concavity of the utility function, a tradeoff between the\naverage rate and rate oscillation can be easily made."

One of the principal methods for link protection\nused in optical WDM networks is pre-configured protection cycle (p-cycle). The\nmajor problem of this method of protection resides in finding the optimal set\nof p-cycles which protect the network for a given distribution of working\ncapacity. Existing heuristics generate a large set of p-cycle candidates which\nare entirely independent of the network state, and from then the good sub-set\nof p-cycles which will protect the network is selected. In this paper, we\npropose a new algorithm of generation of p-cycles based on the incremental\naggregation of the shortest cycles. Our generation of p-cycles depends on the\nstate of the network. This enables us to choose an efficient set of p-cycles\nwhich will protect the network. The set of p-cycles that we generate is the\nfinal set which will protect the network, in other words our heuristic does not\ngo through the additional step of p-cycle selection"

Starting from measurements carried\nout on the off-the-shelf radio, effective radio activation and link adaptation\npolicies are derived.

Impacts of both\nnon-ideal channel and capture effects, specially in an environment of high\ninterference, become important in terms of the actual observed throughput. As\nfar as the 4-way handshaking mechanism is concerned, we extend the\nmulti-dimensional Markovian state transition model characterizing the behavior\nat the MAC layer by including transmission states that account for packet\ntransmission failures due to errors caused by propagation through the channel.\nThis way, any channel model characterizing the physical transmission medium can\nbe accommodated, including AWGN and fading channels. We also extend the Markov\nmodel in order to consider the behavior of the contention window when employing\nthe basic 2-way handshaking mechanism.\n  Under the usual assumptions regarding the traffic generated per node and\nindependence of packet collisions, we solve for the stationary probabilities of\nthe Markov chain and develop expressions for the saturation throughput as a\nfunction of the number of terminals, packet sizes, raw channel error rates,\ncapture probability, and other key system parameters. The theoretical\nderivations are then compared to simulation results confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed models."

Applications include\nscientific data transfers and database backup. In this paper, we present two\nnew, on-line algorithms for advanced reservation, called BatchAll and BatchLim,\nthat are guaranteed to achieve optimal throughput performance, based on\nmulti-commodity flow arguments. Both algorithms are shown to have\npolynomial-time complexity and provable bounds on the maximum delay for\n1+epsilon bandwidth augmented networks. The BatchLim algorithm returns the\ncompletion time of a connection immediately as a request is placed, but at the\nexpense of a slightly looser competitive ratio than that of BatchAll. We also\npresent a simple approach that limits the number of parallel paths used by the\nalgorithms while provably bounding the maximum reduction factor in the\ntransmission throughput. We show that, although the number of different paths\ncan be exponentially large, the actual number of paths needed to approximate\nthe flow is quite small and proportional to the number of edges in the network.\nSimulations for a number of topologies show that, in practice, 3 to 5 parallel\npaths are sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance. The performance\nof the competitive algorithms are also compared to a greedy benchmark, both\nthrough analysis and simulation."

We attack these problems and set out routing in outer\nspace, a new routing mechanism that transforms any shortest path routing\nprotocol (or approximated versions of it) into a new protocol that, in case of\nuniform traffic, guarantees that every node of the network is responsible for\nrelaying the same number of messages, on expectation. We can show that a\nnetwork that uses routing in outer space does not have congested areas, does\nnot have the associated security-related issues, does not encourage selfish\npositioning, and, in spite of using more energy globally, lives longer of the\nsame network using the original routing protocol."

    "summary": "The Semantic Web drives towards the use of the Web for interacting with\nlogically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource\nDescription Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying\nrepresentation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the\nuse of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer\nquestions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of\nobjects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to\nconsider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to\nproblems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that\ninevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert\nanything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web\nenvironment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified\nvariables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the\nWeb, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of\nN3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same\nlanguage can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and\nillustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web."

First, it is shown\nthat adding one edge to a cycle definitely decreases the network\nsychronizability. Then, since sometimes the synchronizability can be enhanced\nby changing the network structure, the question of whether the networks with\nmore edges are easier to synchronize is addressed. It is shown by examples that\nthe answer is negative. This reveals that generally there are redundant edges\nin a network, which not only make no contributions to synchronization but\nactually may reduce the synchronizability. Moreover, an example shows that the\nnode betweenness centrality is not always a good indicator for the network\nsynchronizability. Finally, some more examples are presented to illustrate how\nthe network synchronizability varies following the addition of edges, where all\nthe examples show that the network synchronizability globally increases but\nlocally fluctuates as the number of added edges increases."

These algorithms and\nprotocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure\nreliable communication. Moreover, they have been successfully exploited to\nsupport group communication in distributed systems, broadcasting, multicasting\nand information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks. However, in most of\nthe existing work, the probability of infection is determined heuristically,\nwithout relying on any analytical model. This often leads to unnecessarily high\ntransmission overheads.\n  In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks\ncan be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of\ninformation in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by\nindividuals, i.e., human-based networks. The novelty of our idea resides in the\nevaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network\nfor the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the\nprotocol performance.

It is\ndemonstrated that the algorithm achieves about 90% of the Shannon capacities\ncorresponding to the optimum/near-optimum centralized frequency band\nassignments.

An\ninherent problem in current algorithms is their extensive use of heuristics.\nSuch heuristics incur unbounded errors which are spread over all inferred\nrelationships. We propose a near-deterministic algorithm for solving the ToR\ninference problem. Our algorithm uses as input the Internet core, which is a\ndense sub-graph of top-level ASes. We test several methods for creating such a\ncore and demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm to the core's size and\ndensity, the inference period, and errors in the core.\n  We evaluate our algorithm using AS-level paths collected from RouteViews BGP\npaths and DIMES traceroute measurements. Our proposed algorithm\ndeterministically infers over 95% of the approximately 58,000 AS topology\nlinks. The inference becomes stable when using a week worth of data and as\nlittle as 20 ASes in the core.

The optimality of this simple policy is\nestablished for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based\non numerical results.

If all\nthe three orthogonal frequency channels available in 11b and 11g are used, the\ncapacity can be nearly tripled by the call-admission scheme. This paper also\nproposes for the first time the use of coarse-grained time-division multiple\naccess (CoTDMA) in conjunction with the basic 802.11 CSMA to eliminate the\nperformance-degrading exposed-node and hidden-node problems. We find that\nCoTDMA can further increase the VoIP capacity in the multi-WLAN scenario by an\nadditional 35%."

    "summary": "Fast rate adaptation has been established as an effective way to improve the\nPHY-layer raw date rate of wireless networks. However, within the current IEEE\n802.11 legacy, MAC-layer throughput is dominated by users with the lowest data\nrates, resulting in underutilization of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose\nand analyze a novel distributed MAC strategy, referred to as Rate-aware DCF\n(R-DCF), to leverage the potential of rate adaptation in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The\nkey feature of R-DCF is that by introducing different mini slots according to\nthe instantaneous channel conditions, only contending stations with the highest\ndata rate can access the channel. In this way, the R-DCF protocol not only\nexploits multi-user diversity in a fully distributed manner but also reduces\nthe loss of throughput due to collisions. Through analysis, we develop an\nanalytical model to derive the throughput of R-DCF in general multi-rate WLANs.\nUsing the analytical model we investigate the performance of R-DCF protocol in\nvarious network settings with different rate adaptation strategies and channel\nvariations. Based on the analysis, we further derive the maximal throughput\nachievable by R-DCF. For practical implementation, an offline adaptive backoff\nmethod is developed to achieve a close-to-optimal performance at low runtime\ncomplexity. The superiority of R-DCF is proven via extensive analyses and\nsimulations."

    "summary": "This paper considers the requirements to ensure bounded mean queuing delay\nand non-starvation in a slotted Aloha network operating the exponential backoff\nprotocol. It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted\nAloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation\nthroughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r =\ne/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority\nof prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the\nEthernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r =\n2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise\nobjection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if\nmean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2\nis only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting\nof r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve\nsustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to\n1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the\nqueuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper\nalso delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived\nof service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.\nSpecifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that\nthe conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are\none of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when\nmean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained\nfrom simulation experiments may not converge. A quantitative discussion of this\nissue is provided in this paper."

All routing protocols are the same in this goal, but the way\nthey adopt to achieve it is different, so routing strategy has an egregious\nrole on the performance of an ad hoc network. Most of routing protocols\nproposed for ad hoc networks have a flat structure. These protocols expand the\ncontrol overhead packets to discover or maintain a route. On the other hand a\nnumber of hierarchical-based routing protocols have been developed, mostly are\nbased on layered design. These protocols improve network performances\nespecially when the network size grows up since details about remote portion of\nnetwork can be handled in an aggregate manner. Although, there is another\napproach to design a protocol called cross-layer design. Using this approach\ninformation can exchange between different layer of protocol stack, result in\noptimizing network performances.\n  In this paper, we intend to exert cross-layer design to optimize Cluster\nBased Routing Protocol (Cross-CBRP). Using NS-2 network simulator we evaluate\nrate of cluster head changes, throughput and packet delivery ratio.

This\npaper presents the results of real experiments with varying piece sizes on a\ncontrolled BitTorrent testbed.

    "summary": "To date, most analysis of WLANs has been focused on their operation under\nsaturation condition. This work is an attempt to understand the fundamental\nperformance of WLANs under unsaturated condition. In particular, we are\ninterested in the delay performance when collisions of packets are resolved by\nan exponential backoff mechanism. Using a multiple-vacation queueing model, we\nderive an explicit expression for packet delay distribution, from which\nnecessary conditions for finite mean delay and delay jitter are established. It\nis found that under some circumstances, mean delay and delay jitter may\napproach infinity even when the traffic load is way below the saturation\nthroughput. Saturation throughput is therefore not a sound measure of WLAN\ncapacity when the underlying applications are delay sensitive. To bridge the\ngap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require bounded mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively. The analytical model in this paper is general enough to cover\nboth single-packet reception (SPR) and multi-packet reception (MPR) WLANs, as\nwell as carrier-sensing and non-carrier-sensing networks. We show that the SBMD\nand SBDJ throughputs scale super-linearly with the MPR capability of a network.\nTogether with our earlier work that proves super-linear throughput scaling\nunder saturation condition, our results here complete the demonstration of MPR\nas a powerful capacity-enhancement technique for both delay-sensitive and\ndelay-tolerant applications."

    "summary": "Unlike traditional routing procedures that, at the best, single out a unique\nroute, multi-path routing protocols discover proactively several alternative\nroutes. It has been recognized that multi-path routing can be more efficient\nthan traditional one mainly for mobile ad hoc networks, where route failure\nevents are frequent. Most studies in the area of multi-path routing focus on\nheuristic methods, and the performances of these strategies are commonly\nevaluated by numerical simulations. The need of a theoretical analysis\nmotivates such a paper, which proposes to resort to the terminal-pair routing\nreliability as performance metric. This metric allows one to assess the\nperformance gain due to the availability of route diversity. By resorting to\ngraph theory, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the tolerance of\nmulti-path route discovery processes against route failures for mobile ad hoc\nnetworks. Moreover, we derive a useful bound to easily estimate the performance\nimprovements achieved by multi-path routing with respect to any traditional\nrouting protocol. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness\nof this performance analysis."

In a two-way relay network, relay nodes are used to relay two-way\ninformation flows between pairs of end nodes. This paper proposes a precise\ndefinition for PNC. Specifically, in PNC, a relay node does not decode the\nsource information from the two ends separately, but rather directly maps the\ncombined signals received simultaneously to a signal to be relayed. Based on\nthis definition, PNC can be further sub-classed into two categories - PNCF (PNC\nover finite field) and PNCI (PNC over infinite field) - according to whether\nthe network-code field (or groups, rings) adopted is finite or infinite. For\neach of PNCF and PNCI, we consider two specific estimation techniques for\ndealing with noise in the mapping process.

    "summary": "This paper studies the buffered Aloha with K-exponential backoff collision\nresolution algorithms. The buffered Aloha network is modeled as a multi-queue\nsingle-server system. We adopt a widely used approach in packet switching\nsystems to decompose the multi-queue system into independent first-in-first-out\n(FIFO) queues, which are hinged together by the probability of success of\nhead-of-line (HOL) packets. A unified method is devised to tackle the stability\nand throughput problems of K-exponential backoff with any cutoff phase K. For\nnetworks with a finite number of nodes, we show that the K-exponential backoff\nis stable if the retransmission factor is properly chosen from the stable\nregion. The maximum stable throughput is derived and demonstrated via examples\nof geometric retransmission (K=1) and exponential backoff (K=infinity). For\nnetworks with an infinite number of nodes, we show that geometric\nretransmission is unstable, and the stable network throughput of exponential\nbackoff can only be achieved at the cost of potential unbounded delay in each\ninput queue. Furthermore, we address the stability issue of the systems at the\nundesired stable point. All analytical results presented in this paper are\nverified and confirmed by simulations."

    "summary": "Web Service orchestrations are compositions of different Web Services to form\na new service. The services called during the orchestration guarantee a given\nperformance to the orchestrater, usually in the form of contracts. These\ncontracts can be used by the orchestrater to deduce the contract it can offer\nto its own clients, by performing contract composition. An implicit assumption\nin contract based QoS management is: \"the better the component services\nperform, the better the orchestration's performance will be\". Thus, contract\nbased QoS management for Web services orchestrations implicitly assumes\nmonotony. In some orchestrations, however, monotony can be violated, i.e., the\nperformance of the orchestration improves when the performance of a component\nservice degrades. This is highly undesirable since it can render the process of\ncontract composition inconsistent. In this paper we define monotony for\norchestrations modelled by Colored Occurrence Nets (CO-nets) and we\ncharacterize the classes of monotonic orchestrations. We show that few\norchestrations are indeed monotonic, mostly since latency can be traded for\nquality of data. We also propose a sound refinement of monotony, called\nconditional monotony, which forbids this kind of cheating and show that\nconditional monotony is widely satisfied by orchestrations. This finding leads\nto reconsidering the way SLAs should be formulated."

    "summary": "In the today's Internet and TCP/IP-networks, the queueing of packets is\ncommonly implemented using the protocol FIFO (First In First Out).\nUnfortunately, FIFO performs poorly in the Adversarial Queueing Theory. Other\nqueueing strategies are researched in this model and better results are\nperformed by alternative queueing strategies, e.g. LIS (Longest In System).\nThis article introduces a new queueing protocol called interval-strategy that\nis concerned with the reduction from dynamic to static routing. We discuss the\nmaximum system time for a packet and estimate with up-to-date results how this\ncan be achieved. We figure out the maximum amount of time where a packet can\nspend in the network (i.e. worst case system time), and argue that the\nuniversal instability of the presented interval-strategy can be reached through\nthese results. When a large group of queueing strategies is used for queueing,\nwe prove that the interval-strategy will be universally unstable. Finally, we\ncalculate the maximum time of the static routing to reach an universal stable\nand polynomial - in detail linear - bounded interval-strategy. Afterwards we\nclose - in order to check this upper bound - with up-to-date results about the\ndelivery times in static routing."

    "summary": "Two-tier networks, comprising a conventional cellular network overlaid with\nshorter range hotspots (e.g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired\nrelays), offer an economically viable way to improve cellular system capacity.\nThe capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier\ninterference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due\nto the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different\nfrequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users.\nCentralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and\ninefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a\ntwo-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized\nspectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division\nmultiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms\nof Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible Quality of\nService (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell\nusers attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of\nthis allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel\ninterference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. Design\ninterpretations of this result are provided."

    "summary": "This paper studies the network throughput and transport delay of a multihop\nwireless random access network based on a Markov renewal model of packet\ntransportation.

We\nestablish necessary and sufficient condition on the SD distance for scalable\nnetwork throughput, and address the optimal rate allocation issue with fairness\nand the QoS requirements taken into consideration. In respect to the end-to-end\nperformance, the transport delay is explored in this paper along with network\nthroughput. We characterize the transport delay by relating it to nodal\nqueueing behavior and the SD-distance distribution; the former is a local\nproperty while the latter is a global property. In addition, we apply the large\ndeviation theory to derive the tail distribution of transport delay. To put our\ntheory into practical network operation, several traffic scaling laws are\nprovided to demonstrate how network scalability can be achieved by localizing\nthe traffic pattern, and a leaky bucket scheme at the network access is\nproposed for traffic shaping and flow control."

    "summary": "Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems are becoming more and more\npopular in the field of ubiquitous computing, in particular for objects\nidentification. An RFID system is composed by one or more readers and a number\nof tags. One of the main issues in an RFID network is the fast and reliable\nidentification of all tags in the reader range. The reader issues some queries,\nand tags properly answer. Then, the reader must identify the tags from such\nanswers. This is crucial for most applications. Since the transmission medium\nis shared, the typical problem to be faced is a MAC-like one, i.e. to avoid or\nlimit the number of tags transmission collisions. We propose a protocol which,\nunder some assumptions about transmission techniques, always achieves a 100%\nperfomance. It is based on a proper recursive splitting of the concurrent tags\nsets, until all tags have been identified. The other approaches present in\nliterature have performances of about 42% in the average at most. The\ncounterpart is a more sophisticated hardware to be deployed in the manufacture\nof low cost tags."

    "summary": "Searching in P2P networks is fundamental to all overlay networks.\n  P2P networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are optimized for single\nkey lookups, whereas unstructured networks offer more complex queries at the\ncost of increased traffic and uncertain success rates. Our Distributed Tree\nConstruction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix\nsearch, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by\ncreating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only\ninformation available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning\ntree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of\nmessages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as\na regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime\nbehavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix\nsearch or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC\nalgorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the\nperformance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing\napplication-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30-250% fewer\nmessages than common solutions."

Content-analysis\ntechniques and blacklists, the most popular methods used to identify and block\nspam, are beginning to lose their edge in the battle. We argue here that one\nnot only needs to look into the network-related characteristics of spam\ntraffic, as has been recently suggested, but also to look deeper into the\nnetwork core, in order to counter the increasing sophistication of spam-ing\nmethods. Yet, at the same time, local knowledge available at a given server can\noften be irreplaceable in identifying specific spammers. To this end, in this\npaper we show how the local intelligence of mail servers can be gathered and\ncorrelated pas- sively at the ISP-level providing valuable network-wide\ninformation. Specifically, we use first a large network flow trace from a\nmedium size, national ISP, to demonstrate that the pre-filtering decisions of\nindividual mail servers can be tracked and combined at the flow level. Then, we\nargue that such aggregated knowledge not only can allow ISPs to develop and\nevaluate powerful new methods for fighting spam, but also to monitor remotely\nwhat their own servers are doing."

We qualitatively\ncharacterize the impact of the transmission power of secondary users on the\noccurrence of spectrum opportunities and the reliability of opportunity\ndetection. Based on a Poisson model of the primary network, we quantify these\nimpacts by showing that (i) the probability of spectrum opportunity decreases\nexponentially with respect to the transmission power of secondary users, where\nthe exponential decay constant is given by the traffic load of primary users;\n(ii) reliable opportunity detection is achieved in the two extreme regimes in\nterms of the ratio between the transmission power of secondary users and that\nof primary users. Such analytical characterizations allow us to study power\ncontrol for optimal transport throughput under constraints on the interference\nto primary users. Furthermore, we reveal the difference between detecting\nprimary signals and detecting spectrum opportunities, and demonstrate the\ncomplex relationship between physical layer spectrum sensing and MAC layer\nthroughput. The dependency of this PHY-MAC interaction on the application type\nand the use of handshake signaling such as RTS/CTS is illustrated."

Second, it\nestablishes the conditions under which a network constituted by $N$ stations,\neach station transmitting with its own bit rate, $R^{(s)}_d$, and packet rate,\n$\\lambda_s$, can be assumed loaded. Finally, it proposes a modified\nProportional Fairness (PF) criterion, suitable for mitigating the \\textit{rate\nanomaly} problem of multirate loaded IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, employing the\nmandatory DCF option. Compared to the widely adopted assumption of saturated\nnetwork, the proposed fairness criterion can be applied to general loaded\nnetworks.\n  The throughput allocation resulting from the proposed algorithm is able to\ngreatly increase the aggregate throughput of the DCF, while ensuring fairness\nlevels among the stations of the same order as the ones guaranteed by the\nclassical PF criterion.\n  Simulation results are presented for some sample scenarios, confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed criterion for optimized throughput allocation."

    "summary": "An ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of nodes that come together to\ndynamically create a network, with no fixed infrastructure or centralized\nadministration. An ad-hoc network is characterized by energy constrained nodes,\nbandwidth constrained links and dynamic topology. With the growing use of\nwireless networks (including ad-hoc networks) for real-time applications, such\nas voice, video, and real-time data, the need for Quality of Service (QoS)\nguarantees in terms of delay, bandwidth, and packet loss is becoming\nincreasingly important. Providing QoS in ad-hoc networks is a challenging task\nbecause of dynamic nature of network topology and imprecise state information.\nHence, it is important to have a dynamic routing protocol with fast re-routing\ncapability, which also provides stable route during the life-time of the flows.\n  In this thesis, we have proposed a novel, energy aware, stable routing\nprotocol named, Stability-based QoS-capable Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector\n(SQ-AODV), which is an enhancement of the well-known Ad-hoc On-demand Distance\nVector (AODV) routing protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks. SQ-AODV utilizes a\ncross-layer design approach in which information about the residual energy of a\nnode is used for route selection and maintenance. An important feature of\nSQ-AODV protocol is that it uses only local information and requires no\nadditional communication or co-operation between the network nodes. SQ-AODV\npossesses a make-before-break re-routing capability that enables near-zero\npacket drops and is compatible with the basic AODV data formats and operation,\nmaking it easy to adopt in ad-hoc networks."

This data transfer strategy combined with the\nproposed load balancing strategy have been implemented and tested on a super\ncomputer consisted of 86 CPUs using MPI as the middleware. The results show\nthat the proposed PFS achieves better performance in terms of computing time\nthan the existing Adaptive Contracting Within Neighborhood Strategy. We also\nshow that the combination of both the Proportional Fairness Strategy and the\nproposed data transferring strategy achieves additional 13~15% improvement in\nefficiency of parallelism."

    "summary": "This work calls into question a substantial body of past work on CSMA\nwireless networks. In the majority of studies on CSMA wireless networks, a\ncontention graph is used to model the carrier sensing relationships (CS) among\nlinks. This is a 0-1 model in which two links can either sense each other\ncompletely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not\nthe case: the CS relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can\nvary dynamically over time. This is the case even if the distance between the\nlinks is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore,\nthis partial carrier sensing relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide\nrange of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with\nthe 0-1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn\nfrom previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper\nestablishes a more accurate CS model with the objective of laying down a\nfoundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that\nend, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial carrier sensing\nphenomenon. We discuss the implications and the use of our partial carrier\nsensing model in network analysis."

    "summary": "This paper proposes a new reliability algorithm specifically useful when\nretransmission is either problematic or not possible. In case of multimedia or\nmulticast communications and in the context of the Delay Tolerant Networking\n(DTN), the classical retransmission schemes can be counterproductive in terms\nof data transfer performance or not possible when the acknowledgment path is\nnot always available. Indeed, over long delay links, packets retransmission has\na meaning of cost and must be minimized.In this paper, we detail a novel\nreliability mechanism with an implicit acknowledgment strategy that could be\nused either within these new DTN proposals, for multimedia traffic or in the\ncontext of multicast transport protocols. This proposal is based on a new\non-the-fly erasure coding concept specifically designed to operate efficient\nreliable transfer over bi-directional links. This proposal, named Tetrys,\nallows to unify a full reliability with an error correction scheme. In this\npaper, we model the performance of this proposal and demonstrate with a\nprototype, that we can achieve a full reliability without acknowledgment path\nconfirmation. Indeed, the main findings are that Tetrys is not sensitive to the\nloss of acknowledgments while ensuring a faster data availability to the\napplication compared to other traditional acknowledgment schemes. Finally, we\npave the first step of the integration of such algorithm inside a congestion\ncontrolled protocol."

    "summary": "There is a trend towards using wireless technologies in networked control\nsystems. However, the adverse properties of the radio channels make it\ndifficult to design and implement control systems in wireless environments. To\nattack the uncertainty in available communication resources in wireless control\nsystems closed over WLAN, a cross-layer adaptive feedback scheduling (CLAFS)\nscheme is developed, which takes advantage of the co-design of control and\nwireless communications. By exploiting cross-layer design, CLAFS adjusts the\nsampling periods of control systems at the application layer based on\ninformation about deadline miss ratio and transmission rate from the physical\nlayer. Within the framework of feedback scheduling, the control performance is\nmaximized through controlling the deadline miss ratio. Key design parameters of\nthe feedback scheduler are adapted to dynamic changes in the channel condition.\nAn event-driven invocation mechanism for the feedback scheduler is also\ndeveloped. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in\ndealing with channel capacity variations and noise interference, thus providing\nan enabling technology for control over WLAN."

    "summary": "In wireless sensor networks, bandwidth is one of precious resources to\nmultimedia applications. To get more bandwidth, multipath routing is one\nappropriate solution provided that inter-path interferences are minimized. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of interfering paths in the context of\nwireless multimedia sensor networks and consider both intra-session as well as\ninter-session interferences. Our main objective is to provide necessary\nbandwidth to multimedia applications through non-interfering paths while\nincreasing the network lifetime. To do so, we adopt an incremental approach\nwhere for a given session, only one path is built at once. Additional paths are\nbuilt when required, typically in case of congestion or bandwidth shortage.\nInterference awareness and energy saving are achieved by switching a subset of\nsensor nodes in a {\\em passive state} in which they do not take part in the\nrouting process. Despite the routing overhead introduced by the incremental\napproach we adopt, our simulations show that this can be compensated by the\noverall achieved throughput and the amount of consumed energy per correctly\nreceived packet especially for relatively long sessions such as multimedia\nones. This is mainly due to the fact that a small number of non-interfering\npaths allows for better performances than a large number of interfering ones."

The new CCID was implemented as a NS-2\nmodule. Comparisons were made with the TCP-like CCID and showed that the\nbandwidth utilization was improved by more than 30% and up to 50% in\nsignificant setups."

    "summary": "The sharing of network traces is an important prerequisite for the\ndevelopment and evaluation of efficient anomaly detection mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, privacy concerns and data protection laws prevent network\noperators from sharing these data. Anonymization is a promising solution in\nthis context; however, it is unclear if the sanitization of data preserves the\ntraffic characteristics or introduces artifacts that may falsify traffic\nanalysis results. In this paper, we examine the utility of anonymized flow\ntraces for anomaly detection. We quantitatively evaluate the impact of IP\naddress anonymization, namely variations of permutation and truncation, on the\ndetectability of large-scale anomalies. Specifically, we analyze three weeks of\nun-sampled and non-anonymized network traces from a medium-sized backbone\nnetwork. We find that all anonymization techniques, except prefix-preserving\npermutation, degrade the utility of data for anomaly detection. We show that\nthe degree of degradation depends to a large extent on the nature and mix of\nanomalies present in a trace. Moreover, we present a case study that\nillustrates how traffic characteristics of individual hosts are distorted by\nanonymization."

Deflection routing is used to resolve contention.\nBurst retransmission is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) by\nretransmitting dropped bursts.

    "summary": "In a two tier cellular network -- comprised of a central macrocell underlaid\nwith shorter range femtocell hotspots -- cross-tier interference limits overall\ncapacity with universal frequency reuse. To quantify near-far effects with\nuniversal frequency reuse, this paper derives a fundamental relation providing\nthe largest feasible cellular Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR),\ngiven any set of feasible femtocell SINRs. We provide a link budget analysis\nwhich enables simple and accurate performance insights in a two-tier network. A\ndistributed utility-based SINR adaptation at femtocells is proposed in order to\nalleviate cross-tier interference at the macrocell from cochannel femtocells.\nThe Foschini-Miljanic (FM) algorithm is a special case of the adaptation. Each\nfemtocell maximizes their individual utility consisting of a SINR based reward\nless an incurred cost (interference to the macrocell). Numerical results show\ngreater than 30% improvement in mean femtocell SINRs relative to FM. In the\nevent that cross-tier interference prevents a cellular user from obtaining its\nSINR target, an algorithm is proposed that reduces transmission powers of the\nstrongest femtocell interferers. The algorithm ensures that a cellular user\nachieves its SINR target even with 100 femtocells/cell-site, and requires a\nworst case SINR reduction of only 16% at femtocells. These results motivate\ndesign of power control schemes requiring minimal network overhead in two-tier\nnetworks with shared spectrum."

Unfortunately, there are no mobility\nmodels that capture the non-homogeneous behaviors in both space and time\ncommonly found in reality, while at the same time being easy to use and\nanalyze. Motivated by this, we propose a time-variant community mobility model,\nreferred to as the TVC model, which realistically captures spatial and temporal\ncorrelations. We devise the communities that lead to skewed location visiting\npreferences, and time periods that allow us to model time dependent behaviors\nand periodic re-appearances of nodes at specific locations.\n  To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the TVC model, we use it to\ngenerate synthetic traces that match the characteristics of a number of\nqualitatively different mobility traces, including wireless LAN traces,\nvehicular mobility traces, and human encounter traces. More importantly, we\nshow that, despite the high level of realism achieved, our TVC model is still\ntheoretically tractable. To establish this, we derive a number of important\nquantities related to protocol performance, such as the average node degree,\nthe hitting time, and the meeting time, and provide examples of how to utilize\nthis theory to guide design decisions in routing protocols."

    "summary": "How can we protect the network infrastructure from malicious traffic, such as\nscanning, malicious code propagation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)\nattacks? One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access\ncontrol lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP\nheader. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a\nscarce resource because they are stored in the expensive ternary content\naddressable memory (TCAM).\n  In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying\nfilter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we\nstudy five practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond\nto different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter\nselection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional\nknapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient,\nalgorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from\nDshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice.\nOur set of algorithms is a building block that can be immediately used by\noperators and manufacturers to block malicious traffic in a cost-efficient way."

In the considered P2P framework, the\nserver, which has the information of all the download bandwidths and upload\nbandwidths of the peers, minimizes the weighted average download time by\ndetermining the optimal transmission rate from the server to the peers and from\nthe peers to the other peers. This paper first defines the static P2P network,\nthe hierarchical P2P network and the strictly hierarchical P2P network. Any\nstatic P2P network can be decomposed into an equivalent network of sub-peers\nthat is strictly hierarchical. This paper shows that convex optimization can\nminimize the WADT for P2P networks by equivalently minimizing the WADT for\nstrictly hierarchical networks of sub-peers. This paper then gives an upper\nbound for minimizing WADT by constructing a hierarchical P2P network, and lower\nbound by weakening the constraints of the convex problem. Both the upper bound\nand the lower bound are very tight. This paper also provides several suboptimal\nsolutions for minimizing the WADT for strictly hierarchical networks, in which\npeer selection algorithms and chunk selection algorithm can be locally\ndesigned."

    "summary": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) locality has recently raised a lot of interest in the\ncommunity. Indeed, whereas P2P content distribution enables financial savings\nfor the content providers, it dramatically increases the traffic on inter-ISP\nlinks. To solve this issue, the idea to keep a fraction of the P2P traffic\nlocal to each ISP was introduced a few years ago. Since then, P2P solutions\nexploiting locality have been introduced. However, several fundamental issues\non locality still need to be explored. In particular, how far can we push\nlocality, and what is, at the scale of the Internet, the reduction of traffic\nthat can be achieved with locality? In this paper, we perform extensive\nexperiments on a controlled environment with up to 10 000 BitTorrent clients to\nevaluate the impact of high locality on inter-ISP links traffic and peers\ndownload completion time. We introduce two simple mechanisms that make high\nlocality possible in challenging scenarios and we show that we save up to\nseveral orders of magnitude inter-ISP traffic compared to traditional locality\nwithout adversely impacting peers download completion time. In addition, we\ncrawled 214 443 torrents representing 6 113 224 unique peers spread among 9 605\nASes. We show that whereas the torrents we crawled generated 11.6 petabytes of\ninter-ISP traffic, our locality policy implemented for all torrents would have\nreduced the global inter-ISP traffic by 40%."

    "summary": "When we represent a network of sensors in Euclidean space by a graph, there\nare two distances between any two nodes that we may consider. One of them is\nthe Euclidean distance. The other is the distance between the two nodes in the\ngraph, defined to be the number of edges on a shortest path between them. In\nthis paper, we consider a network of sensors placed uniformly at random in a\ntwo-dimensional region and study two conditional distributions related to these\ndistances. The first is the probability distribution of distances in the graph,\nconditioned on Euclidean distances; the other is the probability density\nfunction associated with Euclidean distances, conditioned on distances in the\ngraph. We study these distributions both analytically (when feasible) and by\nmeans of simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the\nfirst of their kind and open up the possibility of discovering improved\nsolutions to certain sensor-network problems, as for example sensor\nlocalization."

    "summary": "Researchers have proposed a variety of Internet topology models. However\nalmost all of them focus on generating one graph based on one single static\nsource graph. On the other hand, Internet topology is evolving over time\ncontinuously with the addition and deletion of nodes and edges. If a model is\nbased on all the topologies in the past, instead of one of them, it will be\nmore accurate and closer to the real world topology. In this paper, we study\nthe Internet As-level topology time-series from two different sources and find\nthat both of them obey four same dynamic graph patterns. Then we propose a mode\nthat can infer the topology in the future based on all the topologies in the\npast. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we prove the topology that\nour model generates can match both the static and dynamic graph patterns. In\naddition, the parameters in the model are meaningful. Finally, we theoretically\nand experimentally prove that these parameters are directly related to some\nimportant graph characteristics."

    "summary": "This thesis focuses on link scheduling in wireless mesh networks by taking\ninto account physical layer characteristics. The assumption made throughout is\nthat a packet is received successfully only if the Signal to Interference and\nNoise Ratio (SINR) at the receiver exceeds the communication threshold. The\nthesis also discusses the complementary problem of flow control. (1) We\nconsider various problems on centralized link scheduling in Spatial Time\nDivision Multiple Access (STDMA) wireless mesh networks. We motivate the use of\nspatial reuse as performance metric and provide an explicit characterization of\nspatial reuse. We propose link scheduling algorithms based on certain graph\nmodels (communication graph, SINR graph) of the network. Our algorithms achieve\nhigher spatial reuse than that of existing algorithms, with only a slight\nincrease in computational complexity. (2) We investigate random access\nalgorithms in wireless networks. We assume that the receiver is capable of\npower-based capture and propose a splitting algorithm that varies transmission\npowers of users on the basis of quaternary channel feedback. We model the\nalgorithm dynamics by a Discrete Time Markov Chain and consequently show that\nits maximum stable throughput is 0.5518. Our algorithm achieves higher maximum\nstable throughput and significantly lower delay than the First Come First Serve\n(FCFS) splitting algorithm with uniform transmission power. (3) We consider the\nproblem of flow control in packet networks from an information-theoretic\nperspective. We derive the maximum entropy of a flow which conforms to traffic\nconstraints imposed by a generalized token bucket regulator (GTBR), by taking\ninto account the covert information present in randomness of packet lengths."

    "summary": "It has been known that heterogeneous networks are vulnerable to the\nintentional removal of a small fraction of highly connected or loaded nodes,\nwhich implies that, to protect a network effectively, a few important nodes\nshould be allocated with more defense resources than the others. However, if\ntoo many resources are allocated to the few important nodes, the numerous\nless-important nodes will be less protected, which, when attacked all together,\nstill capable of causing a devastating damage. A natural question therefore is\nhow to efficiently distribute the limited defense resources among the network\nnodes such that the network damage is minimized whatever attack strategy the\nattacker may take. In this paper, taking into account the factor of attack\ncost, we will revisit the problem of network security and search for efficient\nnetwork defense against the cost-based attacks. The study shows that, for a\ngeneral complex network, there will exist an optimal distribution of the\ndefense resources, with which the network is well protected from cost-based\nattacks. Furthermore, it is found that the configuration of the optimal defense\nis dependent on the network parameters. Specifically, network that has a larger\nsize, sparser connection and more heterogeneous structure will be more\nbenefited from the defense optimization."

The reliability of this transmission may suffer\nfrom bursty packet losses - the predominant type of failures in today's\nInternet. An effective and well studied solution to this problem is to protect\nthe data by a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code and send the FEC packets over\nmultiple paths.\n  In this paper we show that the performance of such a multipath FEC scheme can\noften be further improved. Our key observation is that the propagation times on\nthe available paths often significantly differ, typically by 10-100ms.\n  We propose to exploit these differences by appropriate packet scheduling that\nwe call `Spread'. We evaluate our solution with a precise, analytical\nformulation and trace-driven simulations. Our studies show that Spread\nsubstantially outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. It typically achieves\ntwo- to five-fold improvement (reduction) in the effective loss rate. Or\nconversely, keeping the same level of effective loss rate, Spread significantly\ndecreases the observed delays and helps fighting the delay jitter."

    "summary": "Mobile wireless network research focuses on scenarios at the extremes of the\nnetwork connectivity continuum where the probability of all nodes being\nconnected is either close to unity, assuming connected paths between all nodes\n(mobile ad hoc networks), or it is close to zero, assuming no multi-hop paths\nexist at all (delay-tolerant networks). In this paper, we argue that a sizable\nfraction of networks lies between these extremes and is characterized by the\nexistence of partial paths, i.e. multi-hop path segments that allow forwarding\ndata closer to the destination even when no end-to-end path is available. A\nfundamental issue in such networks is dealing with disruptions of end-to-end\npaths. Under a stochastic model, we compare the performance of the established\nend-to-end retransmission (ignoring partial paths), against a forwarding\nmechanism that leverages partial paths to forward data closer to the\ndestination even during disruption periods. Perhaps surprisingly, the\nalternative mechanism is not necessarily superior. However, under a stochastic\nmonotonicity condition between current v.s. future path length, which we\ndemonstrate to hold in typical network models, we manage to prove superiority\nof the alternative mechanism in stochastic dominance terms. We believe that\nthis study could serve as a foundation to design more efficient data transfer\nprotocols for partially-connected networks, which could potentially help\nreducing the gap between applications that can be supported over disconnected\nnetworks and those requiring full connectivity."

Recognizing that the periodic erasure scheme usually used in the\ntechnical literature turns out to be quite inefficient when using real traffic\ntraces over a long period of time, we introduce a simple adaptive scheme that\nclosely follows the variations of traffic. When tested against real traffic\ntraces, the proposed on-line algorithm performs well in the sense that the\ndetection ratio of long flows by the algorithm over a long time period is quite\nhigh. Beyond the identification of elephants, this same class of algorithms is\napplied to the closely related problem of detection of anomalies in IP traffic,\ne.g., SYN flood due for instance to attacks. An algorithm for detecting SYN and\nvolume flood anomalies in Internet traffic is designed.

    "summary": "A new method of estimating some statistical characteristics of TCP flows in\nthe Internet is developed in this paper. For this purpose, a new set of random\nvariables (referred to as observables) is defined. When dealing with sampled\ntraffic, these observables can easily be computed from sampled data. By\nadopting a convenient mouse/elephant dichotomy also dependent on traffic, it is\nshown how these variables give a reliable statistical representation of the\nnumber of packets transmitted by large flows during successive time intervals\nwith an appropriate duration. A mathematical framework is developed to estimate\nthe accuracy of the method. As an application, it is shown how one can estimate\nthe number of large TCP flows when only sampled traffic is available. The\nalgorithm proposed is tested against experimental data collected from different\ntypes of IP networks."

Greedy geographical routing has many advantages, but suffers from\npacket losses occurring at the border of voids. In this paper, we propose a\nflexible greedy routing scheme that can be adapted to any variant of\ngeographical routing and works for any connectivity graph, not necessarily Unit\nDisk Graphs. The idea is to reactively detect voids, backtrack packets, and\npropagate information on blocked sectors to reduce packet loss. We also propose\nan extrapolating algorithm to reduce the latency of void discovery and to limit\nroute stretch. Performance evaluation via simulation shows that our modified\ngreedy routing avoids most of packet losses."

    "summary": "The stack in various forms has been widely used as an architectural template\nfor networking systems. Recently the stack has been subject to criticism for a\nlack of flexibility. However, when it comes right down to it nobody has offered\na truly compelling alternative. Various cross-layer optimizations have been\nproposed, but these optimizations are frequently hacks to achieve a particular\ngoal and offer no direct insight into why the existing network stack is\ninadequate. We propose that a fundamental problem with the existing network\nstack is that it attempts to layer functionality that is not well-suited to\nlayering. In this work we use a \"bottom up\" model of information computation,\nstorage, and transfer and the \"top down\" goals of networking systems to\nformulate a modular decomposition of networking systems. Based on this modular\ndecomposition we propose a semantic layered structure for networking systems\nthat eliminates many awkward cross-layer interactions that arise in the\ncanonical layered stack."

In a MANET, the energy\ndepletion of a node does not affect the node itself only, but the overall\nnetwork lifetime. In this paper, we present multipath and energy-aware on\ndemand source routing (MEA-DSR) protocol, which exploits route diversity and\ninformation about batteries-energy levels for balancing energy consumption\nbetween mobile nodes.

The optimality of sub-paths\nensures consistency of hop by hop forwarding although paths, calculated using\nDijkstra algorithm, are recursively composed.

Hence,\nit reduces potential benefits of multipath applications such as load balancing\nand fast rerouting. In this paper, we propose a low time complexity multipath\ncomputation algorithm able to calculate at least two paths with a different\nfirst hop between all pairs of nodes in the network if such next hops exist.\nUsing real and generated topologies, we evaluate and compare the complexity of\nour proposition with several techniques.

In this article we introduce\nthe concept of cognitive wireless mesh (CogMesh) networks and address the\nunique problem in such a network. CogMesh is a self-organized distributed\nnetwork architecture combining cognitive technologies with the mesh structure\nin order to provide a uniform service platform over a wide range of networks.\nIt is based on dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and featured by self-organization,\nself-configuration and self-healing. The unique problem in CogMesh is the\ncommon control channel problem, which is caused by the opportunistic spectrum\nsharing nature of secondary users (SU) in the network. More precisely, since\nthe channels of SUs are fluctuating according to the radio environment, it is\ndifficult to find always available global common control channels. This puts a\nsignificant challenge on the network design. We develop the control cloud based\ncontrol channel selection and cluster based network formation techniques to\ntackle this problem. Moreover, we show in this article that the swarm\nintelligence is a good candidate to deal with the control channel problem in\nCogMesh. Since the study of cognitive wireless networks (CWN) is still in its\nearly phase, the ideas provided in this article act as a catalyst to inspire\nnew solutions in this field."

    "summary": "Underwater communication is a challenging topic due to its singular channel\ncharacteristics. Most protocols used in terrestrial wireless communication can\nnot be directly applied in the underwater world. In this paper, we focus on the\nissue of energy efficient transmission in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs)\nand analyze this problem in a rigorous and theoretical way. We formalize an\noptimization problem which aims to minimize energy consumption and\nsimultaneously accounts for other performance metrics such as the data\nreliability and the communication delay. With the help of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions (KKT conditions), we derive a simple and explicit, but nevertheless\naccurate, approximate solution under reasonable assumptions. This approximate\nsolution provides theoretical guidelines for designing durable and reliable\nUWSNs. Our result also shows that reliability and communication delay are\ncrucial factors to the energy consumption for transmission."

The\nnetwork should preferably be as small (in the sense that the average, or\nmaximal, pathlength is short) as possible, it should be robust to failures, not\nconsume too much power, and so on. In this paper, we investigate simple models\nof how agents can choose their neighbors in such an environment. In our model\nof attachment, we can tune from one situation where agents prefer to attach to\nothers in closest proximity, to a situation where distance is ignored (and thus\nattachments can be made to agents further away). We evaluate this scenario with\nseveral performance measures and find that the optimal topologies, for most of\nthe quantities, is obtained for strategies resulting in a mix of most local and\na few random connections."

    "summary": "Swarming peer-to-peer systems play an increasingly instrumental role in\nInternet content distribution. It is therefore important to better understand\nhow these systems behave in practice. Recent research efforts have looked at\nvarious protocol parameters and have measured how they affect system\nperformance and robustness. However, the importance of the strategy based on\nwhich peers establish connections has been largely overlooked. This work\nutilizes extensive simulations to examine the default overlay construction\nstrategy in BitTorrent systems. Based on the results, we identify a critical\nparameter, the maximum allowable number of outgoing connections at each peer,\nand evaluate its impact on the robustness of the generated overlay. We find\nthat there is no single optimal value for this parameter using the default\nstrategy. We then propose an alternative strategy that allows certain new peer\nconnection requests to replace existing connections. Further experiments with\nthe new strategy demonstrate that it outperforms the default one for all\nconsidered metrics by creating an overlay more robust to churn. Additionally,\nour proposed strategy exhibits optimal behavior for a well-defined value of the\nmaximum number of outgoing connections, thereby removing the need to set this\nparameter in an ad-hoc manner."

The key idea of the physical network model we\npropose is to replace the discrete base stations (BS) entities by a continuum\nof transmitters which are spatially distributed in the network. This allows us\nto establish a closed form formula of the other-cell downlink interference\nfactor f, as a function of the location of the mobile. We define here f as the\nratio of outer cell received power (i.e. the power received from other cells)\nto the inner cell received power. This physical model allows calculating the\ninfluence of interference on any mobile in a cell, whatever its position.\nResults obtained with that closed-form formula are close to the ones obtained\nby simulations using a traditional hexagonal network model. Since the physical\nmodel allows to establish a closed form formula of the interference factor, it\nallows to do analytical studies of wireless networks such as outage\nprobability, quality of service, capacity."

Nowadays, jammers can be portable\ndevices that transmit intermittently at low power in order to conserve energy.\nIn this paper, we first conduct extensive experiments on an indoor 802.11\nnetwork to assess the ability of two physical layer functions, rate adaptation\nand power control, in mitigating jamming. In the presence of a jammer we find\nthat: (a) the use of popular rate adaptation algorithms can significantly\ndegrade network performance and, (b) appropriate tuning of the carrier sensing\nthreshold allows a transmitter to send packets even when being jammed and\nenables a receiver capture the desired signal. Based on our findings, we build\nARES, an Anti-jamming REinforcement System, which tunes the parameters of rate\nadaptation and power control to improve the performance in the presence of\njammers. ARES ensures that operations under benign conditions are unaffected.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of ARES, we evaluate it in\nthree wireless testbeds: (a) an 802.11n WLAN with MIMO nodes, (b) an 802.11a/g\nmesh network with mobile jammers and (c) an 802.11a WLAN.

    "summary": "A multi-channel MAC seems to be an interesting approach for improving network\nthroughput by multiplexing transmissions over orthogonal channels. In\nparticular, Molecular MAC has recently proposed to modify the standard IEEE\n802.11 DCF access method to use dynamic channel switching for efficient packet\nforwarding over multiple hops. However, this MAC layer requires role and\nchannel assignment to nodes: some of them use a static channel, while others\ndynamically switch to neighbor channels on-demand. To assign roles and\nchannels, we extend the notion of the Weakly Connected Dominating Set, the\nstructure already used in clustering. More precisely, we adapt the WCDS\nstructure and introduce new constraints to define what we call a reversible\nWCDS (r-WCDS), which is particularly suitable for wireless mesh networks\noperating under Molecular MAC. We propose a divide-and-conquer scheme that\npartitions the network into clusters with one leader per cluster solving a MILP\nformulation to assign roles in its cluster. By appropriately defining the roles\nat the border of clusters, we maintain global connectivity in the r-wcds.\nFinally, our simulations show that the performance of the propose scheme is\nclose to a centralized algorithm."

Research in this area has concentrated on the\ntheoretical analysis of Ethernet topology as well as developing tools and\nmethods for mapping the network layout. These efforts have brought us to a\ncrucial juncture for Ethernet topology measurement infrastructures: while,\npreviously, these were both small (in terms of number of measurement points),\nwe are starting to see the deployment of large-scale distributed systems\ncomposed of hundreds or thousands of monitors. As we look forward to this next\ngeneration of systems, we take stock of what has been achieved so far.

First, through the cross-layer approach that provides a new service\ndifferentiation approach to the fully distributed UWB systems, we support\ntraffic with quality of service (QoS) guarantee in a multi-user context.\nSecond, we exploit the effective SINR method that represents the\ncharacteristics of multiple sub-carrier SINRs in the multi-band WiMedia\nsolution proposed for UWB systems, in order to provide the channel state\ninformation needed for the multi-user sub-band allocation. This new approach\nimproves the system performance and optimizes the spectrum utilization with a\nlow cost data exchange between the different users while guaranteeing the\nrequired QoS. In addition, this new approach solves the problem of the\ncohabitation of more than three users in the same WiMedia channel."

Part I focuses on\nstability and throughput analysis and Part II presents the delay analysis.\n  In Part I, the buffered Aloha network is modeled as a multi-queue\nsingle-server system. We adopt a widely used approach in packet switching\nsystems to decompose the multi-queue system into independent first-in-first-out\n(FIFO) queues, which are hinged together by the probability of success of\nhead-of-line (HOL) packets. A unified method is devised to tackle the stability\nand throughput problems of K-Exponential Backoff with any cutoff phase K. We\ndemonstrate that a network with K-Exponential Backoff can be stabilized if the\nretransmission factor q is properly selected. The stable region of q is\ncharacterized and illustrated via examples of Geometric Retransmission (K=1)\nand Exponential Backoff (K=infinity). With an increasing number of nodes n, we\nshow that the stable region of Geometric Retransmission rapidly shrinks, and\nvanishes as n goes to infinity. In contrast, the stable region of Exponential\nBackoff does not vary with the network population n, implying that a stable\nthroughput can be achieved in networks with Exponential Backoff even with an\ninfinite number of nodes. All the analytical results presented in this paper\nseries are verified by simulations."

Mean access delay and mean queueing delay are derived\nand demonstrated via the examples of Geometric Retransmission (K=1) and\nExponential Backoff (K=infinity). The comparison shows that higher delay is\nincurred with Geometric Retransmission when the aggregate input rate is small,\nand the delay gap is enlarged as the number of nodes n increases. With a high\ntraffic input rate, however, the delay performance with Exponential Backoff\nseverely deteriorates. The mean queueing delay will be unbounded if the\naggregate input rate exceeds 0.3.\n  We also extend the analysis to the contention-window-based backoff model\nwhich is widely adopted in practical MAC protocols. It will be revealed that\nboth the retransmission-probability-based and the contention-window-based\nmodels exhibit the same stable region and achieve similar queueing performance\nin most cases, which justifies the intuition that was taken but remained\nunverified in previous studies: the retransmission-probability-based backoff\nmodel can serve as a good approximation of the contention-window-based one."

    "summary": "We consider a wireless sensor network whose main function is to detect\ncertain infrequent alarm events, and to forward alarm packets to a base\nstation, using geographical forwarding. The nodes know their locations, and\nthey sleep-wake cycle, waking up periodically but not synchronously. In this\nsituation, when a node has a packet to forward to the sink, there is a\ntrade-off between how long this node waits for a suitable neighbor to wake up\nand the progress the packet makes towards the sink once it is forwarded to this\nneighbr. Hence, in choosing a relay node, we consider the problem of minimizing\naverage delay subject to a constraint on the average progress. By constraint\nrelaxation, involving a Lagrange multiplier, we formulate this next hop relay\nselection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The exact optimal\nsolution (BF (Best Forward)) can be found, but is computationally intensive.\nNext, we consider a mathematically simplified model for which the optimal\npolicy (SF (Simplified Forward)) turns out to be a simple one-step-look-ahead\nrule. Simulations show that SF is very close in performance to BF, even for\nreasonably small node density. We then study the end-to-end performance of SF\nin comparison with two extremal policies: Max Forward (MF), which makes the\nmaximum possible progress per hop and thus reduces network energy consumption,\nand First Forward (FF), which forwards the packet to the first node to wake up,\nand thus tends to make end-to-end forwarding delays small. We find that, with\nappropriate choice of one hop average progress constraint, SF can be tuned to\nprovide a favorable trade-off between end-to-end packet delay and the number of\nhops in the forwarding path."

On the other hand, less expensive, software-based systems exist that are\nwidely available and can be used to perform a number of simple analysis tasks.\nThe caveat with using such software systems is that application of standard\nanalysis methods cannot proceed blindly because inherent distortions exist in\nthe measurements obtained from software systems. The goal of this paper is to\nanalyze common Internet measurement systems to discover the effect of these\ndistortions on common analysis tasks. Then by selecting one specific task,\nperiodic signal detection, a more in-depth analysis is conducted which derives\na signal representation to capture the salient features of the measurement and\ndevelops a periodic detection mechanism designed for the measurement system\nwhich outperforms an existing detection method not optimized for the\nmeasurement system.

    "summary": "In Heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) congestion occurs with\nlimited resources. Due to the shared wireless channel and dynamic topology,\npacket transmissions suffer from interference and fading. In heterogeneous ad\nhoc networks, throughput via a given route is depending on the minimum data\nrate of all its links. In a route of links with various data rates, if a high\ndata rate node forwards more traffic to a low data rate node, there is a chance\nof congestion, which leads to long queuing delays in such routes. Since hop\ncount is used as a routing metric in traditional routing, it do not adapt well\nto mobile nodes. A congestion-aware routing metric for MANETs should\nincorporate transmission capability, reliability, and congestion around a link.\nIn this paper, we propose to develop a hop-by-hop congestion aware routing\nprotocol which employs a combined weight value as a routing metric, based on\nthe data rate, queuing delay, link quality and MAC overhead. Among the\ndiscovered routes, the route with minimum cost index is selected, which is\nbased on the node weight of all the in-network nodes. Simulation results prove\nthat our proposed routing protocol attains high throughput and packet delivery\nratio, by reducing the packet drop and delay."

We adopt a model used in a\nprevious work that characterizes the QoS requirements of clients by their delay\nconstraints, channel reliabilities, and delivery ratio requirements. In this\nwork, we assume that the utility of a client is a function of the delivery\nratio it obtains. We treat the delivery ratio for a client as a tunable\nparameter by the access point (AP), instead of a given value as in the previous\nwork. We then study how the AP should assign delivery ratios to clients so that\nthe total utility of all clients is maximized.\n  We apply the techniques introduced in two previous papers to decompose the\nutility maximization problem into two simpler problems, a CLIENT problem and an\nACCESS-POINT problem. We show that this decomposition actually describes a\nbidding game, where clients bid for the service time from the AP. We prove that\nalthough all clients behave selfishly in this game, the resulting equilibrium\npoint of the game maximizes the total utility. In addition, we also establish\nan efficient scheduling policy for the AP to reach the optimal point of the\nACCESS-POINT problem. We prove that the policy not only approaches the optimal\npoint but also achieves some forms of fairness among clients.

Thus, our model allow the treatment of more realistic fading\nchannels as well as scenarios with mobile nodes, and the usage of more general\ntransmission strategies.\n  We derive a sufficient condition for a scheduling policy to be feasibility\noptimal, and thereby establish a class of feasibility optimal policies. We\ndemonstrate the utility of the identified class by deriving a feasibility\noptimal policy for the scenario with rate adaptation, time-varying channels,\nand heterogeneous delay bounds. When rate adaptation is not available, we also\nderive a feasibility optimal policy for time-varying channels. For the scenario\nwhere rate adaptation is not available but clients have different delay bounds,\nwe describe a heuristic.

    "summary": "Passive network tomography uses end-to-end observations of network\ncommunication to characterize the network, for instance to estimate the network\ntopology and to localize random or adversarial glitches. Under the setting of\nlinear network coding this work provides a comprehensive study of passive\nnetwork tomography in the presence of network (random or adversarial) glitches.\nTo be concrete, this work is developed along two directions: 1. Tomographic\nupper and lower bounds (i.e., the most adverse conditions in each problem\nsetting under which network tomography is possible, and corresponding schemes\n(computationally efficient, if possible) that achieve this performance) are\npresented for random linear network coding (RLNC). We consider RLNC designed\nwith common randomness, i.e., the receiver knows the random code-books all\nnodes. (To justify this, we show an upper bound for the problem of topology\nestimation in networks using RLNC without common randomness.) In this setting\nwe present the first set of algorithms that characterize the network topology\nexactly. Our algorithm for topology estimation with random network errors has\ntime complexity that is polynomial in network parameters. For the problem of\nnetwork error localization given the topology information, we present the first\ncomputationally tractable algorithm to localize random errors, and prove it is\ncomputationally intractable to localize adversarial errors. 2. New network\ncoding schemes are designed that improve the tomographic performance of RLNC\nwhile maintaining the desirable low-complexity, throughput-optimal, distributed\nlinear network coding properties of RLNC. In particular, we design network\ncodes based on Reed-Solomon codes so that a maximal number of adversarial\nerrors can be localized in a computationally efficient manner even without the\ninformation of network topology."

This is usually accomplished by using a subset of these paths\nto forward redundant data units or combinations (if network coding is allowed)\nfrom S to T. Therefore, this enhancement in survivability reduces the useful\nS-T information rate. In this paper we present a new way to enhance the\nsurvivability of the S-T information flow without compromising the maximum\nachievable S-T information rate. To do this, bottleneck links (in the min-cut)\nshould only forward useful information, and not redundant data units. We\nintroduce the idea of extra source or destination connectivity with respect to\na certain S-T max-flow, and then we study two problems: namely, pre-cut\nprotection and post-cut protection. Although our objective in both problems is\nthe same, where we aim to maximize the number of protected paths, our analysis\nshows that the nature of these two problems are very different, and that the\npre-cut protection problem is much harder. Specifically, we prove the hardness\nof the pre-cut protection problem, formulate it as an integer linear program,\nand propose a heuristic approach to solve it. Simulations show that the\nperformance of the heuristic is acceptable even on relatively large networks.\nIn the post-cut problem we show that all the data units, forwarded by the\nmin-cut edges not incident to T, can be post-cut-protected."

    "summary": "A few months ago, the BitTorrent developers announced that the transfer of\ntorrent data in the official client was about to switch to uTP, an\napplication-layer congestion-control protocol using UDP at the transport-layer.\nThis announcement immediately raised an unmotivated buzz about a new, imminent\ncongestion collapse of the whole Internet. Though this reaction was not built\non solid technical foundation, nevertheless a legitimate question remains:\ni.e., whether this novel algorithm is a necessary building block for future\nInternet applications, or whether it may result in an umpteenth addition to the\nalready well populated world of Internet congestion control algorithms.\n  In this paper, we tackle precisely this issue. The novel protocol is now\nunder discussion at the IETF LEDBAT working group, and has been defined in a\ndraft document in March 2009, whose adoption decision will be taken at the\nbeginning of August 2009. Adhering to the IETF draft definition, we implement\nthe LEDBAT congestion control algorithm and investigate its performance by\nmeans of packet-level simulations. Considering a simple bottleneck scenario\nwhere LEDBAT competes against either TCP or other LEDBAT flows, we evaluate the\nfairness of the resource share as well as its efficiency. Our preliminary\nresults show that indeed, there is an undoubted appeal behind the novel\napplication-layer congestion-control protocol. Yet, care must be taken in order\nto ensure that some important points, such as intra-protocol fairness, are\nfully clarified in the draft specification -- which we hope that this work can\ncontribute to."

    "summary": "Wireless Multiuser receivers suffer from their relatively higher\ncomputational complexity that prevents widespread use of this technique. In\naddition, one of the main characteristics of multi-channel communications that\ncan severely degrade the performance is the inconsistent and low values of SNR\nthat result in high BER and poor channel capacity. It has been shown that the\ncomputational complexity of a multiuser receiver can be reduced by using the\ntransformation matrix (TM) algorithm [4]. In this paper, we provide\nquantification of SNR based on the computational complexity of TM algorithm. We\nshow that the reduction of complexity results high and consistent values of SNR\nthat can consequently be used to achieve a desirable BER performance. In\naddition, our simulation results suggest that the high and consistent values of\nSNR can be achieved for a desirable BER performance. The performance measure\nadopted in this paper is the consistent values of SNR."

This trend is motivated mostly by increasing number of carrier Ethernet\nnetworks as well as the size of these networks, and consequently the increasing\nsales of these networks. To manage these networks efficiently, detailed and\naccurate knowledge of their topology is needed. Knowledge of a network's\nentities and the physical connections between them can be useful in various\nprospective. Administrators can use topology information for network planning\nand fault detecting. Topology information can also be used during protocol and\nrouting algorithm development, for performance prediction and as a basis for\naccurate network simulations. From a network security perspective, threat\ndetection, network monitoring, network access control and forensic\ninvestigations can benefit from accurate network topology information. In this\npaper, we analyze market trends and investigate current tools available for\nboth research and commercial purposes."

It is well understood how these protocols behave under FIFO\nqueuing and what the network congestion effects. However, no comprehensive\nanalysis is available when flow-aware mechanisms such as per-flow scheduling\nand dropping policies are deployed. Previous simulation and experimental\nresults leave a number of unanswered questions. In the paper, we tackle this\nissue by modeling via a set of fluid non-linear ODEs the instantaneous\nthroughput and the buffer occupancy of N long-lived TCP sources under three\nper-flow scheduling disciplines (Fair Queuing, Longest Queue First, Shortest\nQueue First) and with longest queue drop buffer management. We study the system\nevolution and analytically characterize the stationary regime: closed-form\nexpressions are derived for the stationary throughput/sending rate and buffer\noccupancy which give thorough understanding of short/long-term fairness for TCP\ntraffic. Similarly, we provide the characterization of the loss rate\nexperienced by UDP flows in presence of TCP traffic."

Traditionally, clustering algorithms\naim at generating a number of disjoint clusters that satisfy some criteria. In\nthis paper, we formulate a novel clustering problem that aims at generating\noverlapping multi-hop clusters. Overlapping clusters are useful in many sensor\nnetwork applications, including inter-cluster routing, node localization, and\ntime synchronization protocols. We also propose a randomized, distributed\nmulti-hop clustering algorithm (KOCA) for solving the overlapping clustering\nproblem. KOCA aims at generating connected overlapping clusters that cover the\nentire sensor network with a specific average overlapping degree. Through\nanalysis and simulation experiments we show how to select the different values\nof the parameters to achieve the clustering process objectives. Moreover, the\nresults show that KOCA produces approximately equal-sized clusters, which\nallows distributing the load evenly over different clusters. In addition, KOCA\nis scalable; the clustering formation terminates in a constant time regardless\nof the network size."

Interestingly, we show that the interference asynchrony can actually\nimprove the BER performance, compared with the situation in which symbols of al\nsignals ay aligned. In particular, we show that symbol misalignment can\ndecrease the \"effective interference power\" and change the distribution of the\ninterfering signals, in a way that results in lower BER. To ensure that symbol\nmisalignment can be consistently attained, we propose two simple schemes that\nintroduce time-varying symbol offsets to obtain an \"average\" performance of\nrandom symbol misalignment. Notably, our schemes do not change the simple\nreceiver design structure; only the transmitters are modified in a minor way."

    "summary": "The two-phase MIMO NC (network coding) scheme can be used to boost the\nthroughput in a two-way relay channel in which nodes are equipped with multiple\nantennas. The obvious strategy is for the relay node to extract the individual\npackets from the two end nodes and mix the two packets to form a network-coded\npacket. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called MIMO PNC (physical\nnetwork coding), in which the relay extracts the summation and difference of\nthe two end packets and then converts them to the network-coded form. MIMO PNC\nis a natural combination of the single-antenna PNC scheme and the linear MIMO\ndetection scheme. The advantages of MIMO PNC are many. First, it removes the\nstringent carrier-phase requirement in single-antenna PNC. Second, it is linear\nin complexity with respect to the constellation size and the number of\nsimultaneous data streams in MIMO. Simulation shows that MIMO PNC outperforms\nthe straightforward MIMO NC significantly under random Rayleigh fading channel.\nBased on our analysis, we further conjecture that MIMO PNC outperforms MIMO NC\nunder all possible realizations of the channel."

    "summary": "A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired\nnetwork is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may\nreach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other\nnodes, simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to \"straightforward\" network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in 1-D regular linear networks\nwith multiple random flows. The throughput improvements are even larger in 2-D\nregular networks: 200% and 100%, respectively."

The purpose\nof the ECN bit is to notify TCP sources of an imminent congestion in order to\nreact before losses occur. However, ECN is a binary indicator which does not\nreflect the congestion level (i.e. the percentage of queued packets) of the\nbottleneck, thus preventing any adapted reaction. In this study, we use a\ncounter in place of the traditional ECN marking scheme to assess the number of\ntimes a packet has crossed a congested router. Thanks to this simple counter,\nwe drive a statistical analysis to accurately estimate the congestion level of\neach router on a network path. We detail in this paper an analytical method\nvalidated by some preliminary simulations which demonstrate the feasibility and\nthe accuracy of the concept proposed. We conclude this paper with possible\napplications and expected future work."

Different\nfrom most of work that adopt the protocol interference model which merely take\nconsideration of packet collisions, our proposed algorithms use the physical\ninterference model to reflect the aggregated signal to interference and noise\nratio (SINR), which is a more accurate abstraction of the real scenario. We\nfirst propose a centralized scheduling method based on the Integer Linear\nProgramming (ILP) and resolve it by an approximate solution based on the\nrandomized rounding method. The probability bound of getting a guaranteed\napproximate factor is given. We then extend the centralized algorithm to a\ndistributed solution, which is favorable in wireless networks. It is proven\nthat with the distributed scheduling method, all links can transmit without\ninterference, and the approximate ratio of the algorithm is also given."

    "summary": "The evolution of the Internet during the last years, has lead to a dramatic\nincrease of the size of its graph at the Autonomous System (AS) level. Soon -\nif not already - its size will make the latter impractical for use from the\nresearch community, e.g. for protocol testing. Reproducing a smaller size,\nsnapshot of the AS graph is thus important. However, the first step towards\nthis direction is to obtain the ability to faithfully reproduce the full AS\ntopology. The objective of our work, is to create a generator able to\naccurately emulate and reproduce the distinctive properties of the Internet\ngraph. Our approach is based on (a) the identification of the jellyfish-like\nstructure [1] of the Internet and (b) the consideration of the peer-to-peer and\ncustomer-provider relations between ASs. We are the first to exploit the\ndistinctive structure of the Internet graph together with utilizing the\ninformation provided by the AS relationships in order to create a tool with the\naforementioned capabilities. Comparing our generator with the existing ones in\nthe literature, the main difference is found on the fact that our tool does not\ntry to satisfy specific metrics, but tries to remain faithful to the conceptual\nmodel of the Internet structure. In addition, our approach can lead to (i) the\nidentification of important attributes and patterns in the Internet AS\ntopology, as well as, (ii) the extraction of valuable information on the\nvarious relationships between ASs and their effect on the formulation of the\nInternet structure. We implement our graph generator and we evaluate it using\nthe largest and most recent available dataset for the AS topology. Our\nevaluations, clearly show the ability of our tool to capture the structural\nproperties of the Internet topology at the AS level with high accuracy."

    "summary": "This report considers the class of applications of sensor networks in which\neach sensor node makes measurements, such as temperature or humidity, at the\nprecise location of the node. Such spot-sensing applications approximate the\nphysical condition of the entire region of interest by the measurements made at\nonly the points where the sensor nodes are located. Given a certain density of\nnodes in a region, a more spatially uniform distribution of the nodes leads to\na better approximation of the physical condition of the region. This report\nconsiders the error in this approximation and seeks to improve the quality of\nrepresentation of the physical condition of the points in the region in the\ndata collected by the sensor network. We develop two essential metrics which\ntogether allow a rigorous quantitative assessment of the quality of\nrepresentation achieved: the average representation error and the unevenness of\nrepresentation error, the latter based on a well-accepted measure of inequality\nused in economics. We present the rationale behind the use of these metrics and\nderive relevant theoretical bounds on them in the common scenario of a planar\nregion of arbitrary shape covered by a sensor network deployment. A simple new\nheuristic algorithm is presented for each node to determine if and when it\nshould sense or sleep to conserve energy while also preserving the quality of\nrepresentation. Simulation results show that it achieves a significant\nimprovement in the quality of representation compared to other related\ndistributed algorithms. Interestingly, our results also show that improved\nspatial uniformity has the welcome side-effect of a significant increase in the\nnetwork lifetime."

In the\ndesign of pricing schemes, we consider price to be a function of usage and\ncapacity of download/upload streams, and quality of content served. Users are\nconsumers and servers at the same time in such networks, and often exhibit\nbehavior that is unfavorable towards maximization of social benefits.\nTraditionally, network designers have overcome this difficulty by building-in\ntraffic latencies. However, using simulations, we show that appropriate pricing\nschemes and usage terms can enable designers to limit required traffic\nlatencies, and be able to earn nearly 30% extra revenue from providing P2PTV\nservices. The service provider adjusts the prices of individual programs\nincrementally within rounds, while making relatively large-scale adjustments at\nthe end of each round. Through simulations, we show that it is most beneficial\nfor the service provider to carry out 5 such rounds of price adjustments for\nmaximizing his average profit and minimizing the associated standard deviation\nat the same time."

    "summary": "The advent of fourth generation technologies in wireless networks and the\nrapid growth of 3G have heralded an era that will require researchers to find\nreliable and easily implement-able solutions to the problem of poor TCP\nperformance in the wireless environment. Since a large part of the Internet is\nTCP-based, solving this problem will be instrumental in determining if the move\nfrom wired to wireless will be seamless or not. This paper proposes a scheme\nthat uses the base station's ability to predict the time at which the link may\nbe going down and to estimate the period for which the mobile would be\nunreachable due to conditions like fading. By using cross-layer and ACK pacing\nalgorithms, the base station prevents the fixed host from timing out while\nwaiting for ACKs from the mobile. This in turn prevents TCP on the fixed host\nfrom bringing down the throughput drastically due to temporary network\nconditions, caused by mobility or the unreliability of wireless links.\nExperimental results indicate a reasonable increase in throughput when the ACK\nholding scheme is used."

We show that the ensemble mean of the RSS\nvariance has an approximately linear relationship with the expected total\naffected power (ETAP). We then use analysis to derive approximate expressions\nfor the ETAP as a function of the person's position, for both scattering and\nreflection.

However, standing at this crossroad, we find that we\nare in a situation that lacks a theory of network designing. This issue becomes\neven more serious as the recent progress of network measurement and modeling\nchallenges the foundation of network research in the past decades.\n  This paper tries to set up a scientific foundation for network designing by\nformalizing it as a multi-objective optimization process and quantifying the\nway different designing choices independently and collectively influence these\nobjectives. A cartesian coordinate system is introduced to map the effect of\neach designing scheme to a coordinate. We investigated the achievable area of\nthe network designing space and proved some boundary conditions. It is shown\nthat different kind of networks display different shapes of achievable areas in\nthe cartesian coordinate and exhibit different abilities to achieve\ncost-effective and scalable designing. In particular, we found that the\nphilosophy underlying current empirical network designing and engineering fails\nto meet the cost-effective and evolvable requirements of network designing. We\ndemonstrated that the efficient routing combined with effective betweenness\nbased link bandwidth allocation scheme is a cost-effective and scalable design\nfor BA-like scale-free networks, whereas if other designing choices cannot be\ndetermined beforehand, ER network is a markedly good candidate for\ncost-effective and scalable design."

This paper conceptualizes feeds as a way to serialize\nquery results, describes the current hardcoded query semantics of such a\nperspective, and surveys the ways in which extensions of this hardcoded model\nhave been proposed or implemented.

    "summary": "This paper proposes a mathematical justification of the phenomenon of extreme\ncongestion at a very limited number of nodes in very large networks. It is\nargued that this phenomenon occurs as a combination of the negative curvature\nproperty of the network together with minimum length routing. More\nspecifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of\nradius R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the\nproportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center is\nindependent of the radius R whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion\nscales as 1/R^{n-1}. This discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at\nthe center of the hyperbolic ball scales as the square of the volume, whereas\nthe same traffic load scales as the volume to the power (n+1)/n in the\nEuclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental\nexponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in\nGromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic\nEuclidean lattice networks. It is further conjectured that for networks that do\nnot enjoy the obvious symmetry of hyperbolic and Euclidean balls, the point of\nmaximum traffic is near the center of mass of the network."

Samples of the separation between the probe pairs at the\ndestination(s) are observed. Heuristic techniques are then used by these tools\nto estimate the path characteristics from the observations. In this paper we\npresent a queueing theoretic setting for packet-dispersion based probing.\nAnalogous to network tomography, we develop techniques to estimate the\nparameters of the arrival process to the individual links from the samples of\nthe output separations, i.e., from the end-to-end measurements. The links are\nmodeled as independent discrete time queues with i.i.d. arrivals. We first\nobtain an algorithm to obtain the (joint) distribution of the separation\nbetween the probes at the destination(s) for a given distribution of the\nspacing at the input. The parameter estimates of the arrival process are\nobtained as the minimizer of a cost function between the empirical and\ncalculated distributions. We also carry out extensive simulations and numerical\nexperiments to study the performance of the estimation algorithm under the\nfairly `harsh' conditions of non stationarity of the arrival process.

Cisco's routers can send NetFlow packets to\na special node, so we can collect these packets, analyze its content and detect\nnetwork congestion. We use Cisco's feature as example, some other vendors\n(Juniper, 3COM, Alcatel, etc.) provide similar features for their routers.

In this paper, we develop a novel, yet simple, asymptotic analysis\nof a splitting-based multiple access selection algorithm to find the single\nbest relay. The analysis leads to simpler and alternate expressions for the\naverage number of slots required to find the best user. By introducing a new\n`contention load' parameter, the analysis shows that the parameter settings\nused in the existing literature can be improved upon. New and simple bounds are\nalso derived. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that addresses the\ngeneral problem of selecting the best $Q \\ge 1$ relays, and analyze and\noptimize it. Even for a large number of relays, the algorithm selects the best\ntwo relays within 4.406 slots and the best three within 6.491 slots, on\naverage. We also propose a new and simple scheme for the practically relevant\ncase of discrete metrics.

    "summary": "In optical WDM networks, since each lightpath can carry a huge mount of\ntraffic, failures may seriously damage the end user applications. Hence fault\ntolerance becomes an important issue on these networks. The light path which\ncarries traffic during normal operation is called as primary path. The traffic\nis rerouted on a backup path in case of a failure. In this paper we propose to\ndesign a reliable and fault tolerant routing algorithm for establishing primary\nand backup paths. In order to establish the primary path, this algorithm uses\nload balancing in which link cost metrics are estimated based on the current\nload of the links. In backup path setup, the source calculates the blocking\nprobability through the received feedback from the destination by sending a\nsmall fraction of probe packets along the existing paths. It then selects the\noptimal light path with the lowest blocking probability. Based on the\nsimulation results, we show that the reliable and fault tolerant routing\nalgorithm reduces the blocking probability and latency while increasing the\nthroughput and channel utilization."

    "summary": "BitTorrent suffers from one fundamental problem: the long-term availability\nof content. This occurs on a massive-scale with 38% of torrents becoming\nunavailable within the first month. In this paper we explore this problem by\nperforming two large-scale measurement studies including 46K torrents and 29M\nusers. The studies go significantly beyond any previous work by combining\nper-node, per-torrent and system-wide observations to ascertain the causes,\ncharacteristics and repercussions of file unavailability. The study confirms\nthe conclusion from previous works that seeders have a significant impact on\nboth performance and availability. However, we also present some crucial new\nfindings: (i) the presence of seeders is not the sole factor involved in file\navailability, (ii) 23.5% of nodes that operate in seedless torrents can finish\ntheir downloads, and (iii) BitTorrent availability is discontinuous, operating\nin cycles of temporary unavailability. Due to our new findings, we consider it\nis important to revisit the solution space; to this end, we perform large-scale\ntrace-based simulations to explore the potential of two abstract approaches."

    "summary": "The challenges of optimizing end-to-end performance over diverse Internet\npaths has driven widespread adoption of in-path optimizers, which can\ndestructively interfere with TCP's end-to-end semantics and with each other,\nand are incompatible with end-to-end IPsec. We identify the architectural cause\nof these conflicts and resolve them in Tng, an experimental next-generation\ntransport services architecture, by factoring congestion control from\nend-to-end semantic functions. Through a technique we call \"queue sharing\", Tng\nenables in-path devices to interpose on, split, and optimize congestion\ncontrolled flows without affecting or seeing the end-to-end content riding\nthese flows. Simulations show that Tng's decoupling cleanly addresses several\ncommon performance problems, such as communication over lossy wireless links\nand reduction of buffering-induced latency on residential links. A working\nprototype and several incremental deployment paths suggest Tng's practicality."

    "summary": "Packet and flow scheduling algorithms for WiMAX has been a topic of interest\nfor a long time since the very inception of WiMAX networks. WiMAX offers\nadvantages particularly in terms of Quality of service it offers over a longer\nrange at the MAC level. In our work, we propose two credit based scheduling\nschemes one in which completed flows distributes the left over credits equally\nto all higher priority uncompleted flows(ODRREDC) and another in which\ncompleted flows give away all the excess credits to the highest priority\nuncompleted flow(ODRRSDC). Both the schemes are compatible with 802.16 MAC\nprotocol and can efficiently serve real time bursty traffic with reduced\nlatency and hence improved QOS for real time flows. We compare the two proposed\nschemes for their latency, bandwidth utilization and throughput for real time\nburst flows with the opportunity based Deficit Round Robin scheduling scheme.\nWhile the ODRR scheduler focuses on reducing the credits for the flows with\nerrors, our approach also distributes these remaining credits together with the\ncredits from completed flows equally among the higher priority uncompleted\nflows or totally to the highest priority uncompleted flow."

The range and the Non Line of Sight (NLOS) ability of WIMAX\nmake the system very attractive for users, but there will be slightly higher\nBER at low SNR. The aim of this paper is the comparative study of different\nguard time intervals effect for improving BER at different SNR under digital\nmodulation (QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM) techniques and different communication\nchannels AWGN and fading channels Stanford University Interim (SUI 1) of an\nWIMAX system. The comparison between these effects with Reed-Solomon (RS)\nencoder with Convolutional encoder (half) rated codes in FEC channel coding\nwill be investigated. The simulation results of estimated Bit Error Rate (BER)\ndisplays that the implementation of interleaved RS code (255,239,8) with (half)\nrated Convolutional code of 0.25 guard time intervals under QPSK modulation\ntechnique over AWGN channel is highly effective to combat in the Wimax\ncommunication system. To complete this performance analysis in Wimax based\nsystems, a segment of audio signal is used for analysis.

    "summary": "Multicasting is effective when its group members are sparse and the speed is\nlow. On the other hand, broadcasting is effective when the group members dense\nand the speed are high. Since mobile ad hoc networks are highly dynamic in\nnature, either of the above two strategies can be adopted at different\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose an ant agent based adaptive, multicast\nprotocol that exploits group members desire to simplify multicast routing and\ninvoke broadcast operations in appropriate localized regimes. By reducing the\nnumber of group members that participate in the construction of the multicast\nstructure and by providing robustness to mobility by performing broadcasts in\ndensely clustered local regions, the proposed protocol achieves packet delivery\nstatistics that are comparable to that with a pure multicast protocol but with\nsignificantly lower overheads. By our simulation results, we show that our\nproposed protocol achieves increased Packet Delivery Fraction (PDF) with\nreduced overhead and routing load."

    "summary": "Solving free riding and selecting a reliable service provider in P2P networks\nhas been separately investigated in last few years. Using trust has shown to be\none of the best ways of solving these problems. But using this approach to\nsimultaneously deal with both problems makes it impossible for newcomers to\njoin the network and the expansion of network is prevented. In this paper we\nused the game theory to model the behavior of peers and developed a mechanism\nin which free riding and providing bad service are dominated strategies for\npeers. At the same time newcomers can participate and are encouraged to be\nactive in the network. The proposed model has been simulated and the results\nshowed that the trust value of free riders and bad service providers converge\nto a finite value and trust of peers who provide good service is monotonically\nincreased despite the time they join the network."

    "summary": "In hierarchical Mobile IPv6 networks, Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) may become\na single point of bottleneck as it handles more and more mobile nodes (MNs). A\nnumber of schemes have been proposed to achieve load balancing among different\nMAPs. However, signaling reduction is still imperfect because these schemes\nalso avoid the effect of the number of CNs. Also only the balancing of MN is\nperformed, but not the balancing of the actual traffic load, since CN of each\nMN may be different. This paper proposes an efficient admission control\nalgorithm along with a replacement mechanism for HMIPv6 networks. The admission\ncontrol algorithm is based on the number of serving CNs and achieves actual\nload balancing among MAPs. Moreover, a replacement mechanism is introduced to\ndecrease the new MN blocking probability and the handoff MN dropping\nprobability. By simulation results, we show that, the handoff delay and packet\nloss are reduced in our scheme, when compared with the standard HMIPv6 based\nhandoff."

    "summary": "This paper proposes and investigates the concept of a safe carrier-sensing\nrange that can guarantee interference safe (also termed hidden-node-free)\ntransmissions in CSMA networks under the cumulative interference model.\nCompared with the safe carrier-sensing range under the commonly assumed but\nless realistic pairwise interference model, we show that the safe\ncarrier-sensing range required under the cumulative interference model is\nlarger by a constant multiplicative factor. The concept of a safe\ncarrier-sensing range, although amenable to elegant analytical results, is\ninherently not compatible with the conventional power threshold carrier-sensing\nmechanism (e.g., that used in IEEE 802.11). Specifically, the absolute power\nsensed by a node in the conventional mechanism does not contain enough\ninformation for it to derive its distances from other concurrent transmitter\nnodes. We show that, fortunately, a carrier-sensing mechanism called\nIncremental-Power Carrier-Sensing (IPCS) can realize the carrier-sensing range\nconcept in a simple way. Instead of monitoring the absolute detected power, the\nIPCS mechanism monitors every increment in the detected power. This means that\nIPCS can separate the detected power of every concurrent transmitter, and map\nthe power profile to the required distance information."

    "summary": "The large scale content distribution systems were improved broadly using the\nreplication techniques. The demanded contents can be brought closer to the\nclients by multiplying the source of information geographically, which in turn\nreduce both the access latency and the network traffic. The system scalability\ncan be improved by distributing the load across multiple servers which is\nproposed by replication. If a copy of the requested object (e.g., a web page or\nan image) is located in its closer proximity then the clients would feel low\naccess latency. Depending on the position of the replicas, the effectiveness of\nreplication tends to a large extent. A QoS based overlay network architecture\ninvolving an intelligent replica placement algorithm is proposed in this paper.\nIts main goal is to improve the network utilization and fault tolerance of the\nP2P system. In addition to the replica placement, it also has a caching\ntechnique, to reduce the search latency.

    "summary": "This paper studies the optimal investment and pricing decisions of a\ncognitive mobile virtual network operator (C-MVNO) under spectrum supply\nuncertainty. Compared with a traditional MVNO who often leases spectrum via\nlong-term contracts, a C-MVNO can acquire spectrum dynamically in short-term by\nboth sensing the empty \"spectrum holes\" of licensed bands and dynamically\nleasing from the spectrum owner. As a result, a C-MVNO can make flexible\ninvestment and pricing decisions to match the current demands of the secondary\nunlicensed users. Compared to dynamic spectrum leasing, spectrum sensing is\ntypically cheaper, but the obtained useful spectrum amount is random due to\nprimary licensed users' stochastic traffic. The C-MVNO needs to determine the\noptimal amounts of spectrum sensing and leasing by evaluating the trade off\nbetween cost and uncertainty. The C-MVNO also needs to determine the optimal\nprice to sell the spectrum to the secondary unlicensed users, taking into\naccount wireless heterogeneity of users such as different maximum transmission\npower levels and channel gains. We model and analyze the interactions between\nthe C-MVNO and secondary unlicensed users as a Stackelberg game. We show\nseveral interesting properties of the network equilibrium, including threshold\nstructures of the optimal investment and pricing decisions, the independence of\nthe optimal price on users' wireless characteristics, and guaranteed fair and\npredictable QoS among users. We prove that these properties hold for general\nSNR regime and general continuous distributions of sensing uncertainty. We show\nthat spectrum sensing can significantly improve the C-MVNO's expected profit\nand users' payoffs."

Using theories and\ntechniques from continuum percolation and ergodicity, we establish the scaling\nlaw of the minimum multihop delay with respect to the source-destination\ndistance in cognitive radio networks. When the propagation delay is negligible,\nwe show the starkly different scaling behavior of the minimum multihop delay in\ninstantaneously connected networks as compared to networks that are only\nintermittently connected due to scarcity of spectrum opportunities.\nSpecifically, if the network is instantaneously connected, the minimum multihop\ndelay is asymptotically independent of the distance; if the network is only\nintermittently connected, the minimum multihop delay scales linearly with the\ndistance. When the propagation delay is nonnegligible but small, we show that\nalthough the scaling order is always linear, the scaling rate for an\ninstantaneously connected network can be orders of magnitude smaller than the\none for an intermittently connected network."

    "summary": "Multi-channel wireless networks are increasingly being employed as\ninfrastructure networks, e.g. in metro areas. Nodes in these networks\nfrequently employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such\nnetworks, given a source and destination, it is of interest to compute an\noptimal path and channel assignment on every link in the path such that the\npath bandwidth is the same as that of the link bandwidth and such a path\nsatisfies the constraint that no two consecutive links on the path are assigned\nthe same channel, referred to as \"Channel Discontinuity Constraint\" (CDC).\nCDC-paths are also quite useful for TDMA system, where preferably every\nconsecutive links along a path are assigned different time slots.\n  This paper contains several contributions. We first present an $O(N^{2})$\ndistributed algorithm for discovering the shortest CDC-path between given\nsource and destination. This improves the running time of the $O(N^{3})$\ncentralized algorithm of Ahuja et al. for finding the minimum-weight CDC-path.\nOur second result is a generalized $t$-spanner for CDC-path; For any $\\theta>0$\nwe show how to construct a sub-network containing only $O(\\frac{N}{\\theta})$\nedges, such that that length of shortest CDC-paths between arbitrary sources\nand destinations increases by only a factor of at most\n$(1-2\\sin{\\tfrac{\\theta}{2}})^{-2}$. We propose a novel algorithm to compute\nthe spanner in a distributed manner using only $O(n\\log{n})$ messages. An\nimportant conclusion of this scheme is in the case of directional antennas are\nused. In this case, it is enough to consider only the two closest nodes in each\ncone."

    "summary": "The telephony over IP (ToIP) is becoming a new trend in technology widely\nused nowadays in almost all business sectors. Its concepts rely on transiting\nthe telephone communications through the IP network. Today, this technology is\ndeployed increasingly what the cause of emergence of companies is offering this\nservice as Switzernet. For several highly demanded destinations, recently fake\nvendors appeared in the market offering voice termination but providing only\nfalse answer supervision. The answered signal is returned immediately and calls\nare being charged without being connected. Different techniques are used to\nkeep the calling party on the line. One of these techniques is to play a record\nof a ring back tone (while the call is already being charged). Another, more\nsophisticated technique is to play a human voice randomly picked up from a set\nof records containing contents similar to: hello, hello, I cannot hear you\nApart the fact that the fallaciously established calls are charged at rates of\nreal calls, such malicious routes seriously handicap the switching process. The\nsystem does not detect a failure on signaling level and is unable to attempt\nthe call via backup routes, the call technically being already connected. Once\nthe call flow falls into such trap, the calls will continue being routed via\nthe fraudulent route until a manual intervention."

Recently, utility maximization framework is\napplied in order to optimize performance of such networks however delay is not\nlimited and proposed algorithms result in very large transmission delays. In\nthis paper, we will analyze delay in random access multi-hop networks and solve\nthe delay-constrained utility maximization problem. We define the network\nutility as a combination of rate utility and energy cost functions and solve\nthe following two problems: 'optimal medium access control with link delay\nconstraint' and, 'optimal congestion and contention control with end-to-end\ndelay constraint'. The optimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is\nachieved for different values of delay constraint and the scaling factors\nbetween rate and energy.

    "summary": "A new framework to perform routing at the Autonomous System level is proposed\nin this paper. This mechanism, called Chain Routing, uses complete orders as\nits main topological unit. Since complete orders are acyclic digraphs that\npossess a known topology, it is possible to define an acyclic structure to\nroute packets between a group of Autonomous Systems. The adoption of complete\norders also allows easy identification and avoidance of persistent route\noscillations, eliminates the possibility of developing transient loops in\npaths, and provides a structure that facilitates the implementation of traffic\nengineering. Moreover, by combining Chain Routing with other mechanisms that\nimplement complete orders in time, we suggest that it is possible to design a\nnew routing protocol which could be more reliable and stable than BGP's current\nimplementation. Although Chain Routing will require an increase of the message\noverhead and greater coordination between network administrators, the rewards\nin stability and resilience should more than compensate for this effort."

In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio\nnetwork in which a primary user shares a channel with secondary users that\ncannot distinguish the signals of the primary user from those of a secondary\nuser. We propose a class of distributed cognitive MAC protocols to achieve\nefficient spectrum sharing among the secondary users while protecting the\nprimary user from potential interference by the secondary users. By using a MAC\nprotocol with one-slot memory, we can obtain high channel utilization by the\nsecondary users while limiting interference to the primary user at a low level.\nThe results of this paper suggest the possibility of utilizing MAC design in\ncognitive radio networks to overcome limitations in spectrum sensing at the PHY\nlayer as well as to achieve spectrum sharing at the MAC layer."

We examine the buffer\ndynamics at the mobile terminal and the central server under varying wireless\nchannel connectivity and device memory congestion states as variable sizes\ntasks are executed on the terminal. Our goal is to minimize the latency\nexperienced by these tasks while judiciously utilizing the device buffering\ncapability.

We further propose a) a prefetching algorithm Fetch-or- Not\n(FON), which uses quasi-static assumption on system state to make prefetching\ndecisions, and b) a prefetching policy RFON, which uses randomized\napproximation to the optimal solution thus obviating the need for dynamic\nonline optimization and substantially reducing the computational complexity.\nThrough performance evaluation under slow and fast fading scenarios we show\nthat proposed algorithms come close to performance of the optimal scheme."

With PNC,the destructive effect of interference in wireless networks is\neliminated and the capacity of networks can be boosted significantly. This\npaper addresses a key outstanding issue in PNC: synchronization among\ntransmitting nodes. We first investigate the impact of imperfect\nsynchronization (i.e., finite synchronization errors) in a 3-node network. It\nis shown that with QPSK modulation, PNC still yields significantly higher\ncapacity than straightforward network coding when there are synchronization\nerrors. Significantly, this remains to be so even in the extreme case when\nsynchronization is not performed at all. Moving beyond a 3-node network, we\npropose and investigate a synchronization scheme for PNC in a general chain\nnetwork. At last, numerical simulation verifies that PNC is robust to\nsynchronization errors. In particular, for the mutual information performance,\nthere is about 0.5dB loss without time synchronization and there is at most 2dB\nloss without phase synchronization."

The moments of this\ndistribution are easily computed, using the Fenton-Wilkinson method, and a\nfluid model that considers the cellular network as a continuum of BS. Then\nconsidering the joint impact of pathloss, shadowing and fast fading, we derive\nan easily computable outage probability formula, for a mobile located at any\ndistance from its serving BS. We validate our approach by comparing all results\nto Monte Carlo simulations performed in a traditional hexagonal network.\nIndeed, we establish that the results given by the formula are close to the\nones given by Monte Carlo simulations.

    "summary": "Managing heterogeneous network systems is a difficult task because each of\nthese networks has its own curious management system. These networks usually\nare constructed on independent management protocols which are not compatible\nwith each other. This results in the coexistence of many management systems\nwith different managing functions and services across enterprises.\nIncompatibility of different management systems makes management of whole\nsystem a very complex and often complicated job. Ideally, it is necessary to\nimplement centralized metalevel management across distributed heterogeneous\nsystems and their underlying supporting network systems where the information\nflow and guidance is provided via a single console or single operating panels\nwhich integrates all the management functions in spite of their individual\nprotocols and structures.

    "summary": "The network communication scenario where one or more receivers request all\nthe information transmitted by different sources is considered. We introduce\ndistributed polynomial-time network codes in the presence of malicious nodes.\nOur codes can achieve any point inside the rate region of multiple-source\nmulticast transmission scenarios both in the cases of coherent and non-coherent\nnetwork coding. For both cases the encoding and decoding algorithm runs in\npoly(|E|)exp(s) time, where poly(|E|) is a polynomial function of the number of\nedges |E| in the network and exp(s) is an exponential function of the number of\nsources s. Our codes are fully distributed and different sources require no\nknowledge of the data transmitted by their peers. Our codes are \"end-to-end\",\nthat is, all nodes apart from the sources and the receivers are oblivious to\nthe adversaries present in the network and simply implement random linear\nnetwork coding."

    "summary": "As the Internet becomes increasingly heterogeneous, the issue of congestion\navoidance and control becomes ever more important. And the queue length,\nend-to-end delays and link utilization is some of the important things in term\nof congestion avoidance and control mechanisms. In this work we continue to\nstudy the performances of the New-AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative\nDecrease) mechanism as one of the core protocols for TCP congestion avoidance\nand control algorithm, we want to evaluate the effect of using the AIMD\nalgorithm after developing it to find a new approach, as we called it the\nNew-AIMD algorithm to measure the Queue length, delay and bottleneck link\nutilization, and use the NCTUns simulator to get the results after make the\nmodification for the mechanism. And we will use the Droptail mechanism as the\nactive queue management mechanism (AQM) in the bottleneck router. After\nimplementation of our new approach with different number of flows, we expect\nthe delay will less when we measure the delay dependent on the throughput for\nall the system, and also we expect to get end-to-end delay less. And we will\nmeasure the second type of delay a (queuing delay), as we shown in the figure 1\nbellow. Also we will measure the bottleneck link utilization, and we expect to\nget high utilization for bottleneck link with using this mechanism, and avoid\nthe collisions in the link."

In this paper we ex-plored the benefits of adaptive\ncooperation, in which the relay adapts its relaying process in response to\nchannel conditions and data priorities. We are particularly interested in\napplying this concept to the cell border situation, in which two mobile nodes\nacting as destinations com-municate with base stations (sources) through a\nrelay. The adaptive cooperation is proposed here since the transmission channel\nconditions (Packet Error Rate for example) and data priori-ties are not the\nsame for both mobiles. We show that using the adaptive resource allocation\ntechnique in combination with the cross layer design techniques, we can achieve\nReal-Time data constraints with no additional overhead."

    "summary": "Understanding transport capacity in intermittently connected mobile networks\n(ICMN) is crucial since different applications have different interactivity and\nbandwidth requirements. One practical issue is how to transform an\napplication's messages into packets suitable for transport over an ICMN. In\nthis paper, we propose a new Markovian model for random temporal graphs and\nshow, both analytically and by replaying a real life trace obtained in a\nrollerblading tour, that the size of the messages sent over an ICMN has a\ndecisive impact on their delivery ratio. A given message could therefore be\nbroken down into smaller packets to increase reliability. However, we also show\nthat this gain in reliability only appears under tight constraints on the\nmaximum delay tolerated. Mobile application designers should therefore balance\nmessage size against both application requirements and network topology\ndynamics to improve performance."

The\nintroduction of improved routing systems to meet the increasing demand and\nvaried protocols to accommodate various scales of challenges in network\nefficiency had further complicated the operations.

Working with mobility\ninformation allows richer protocol simulations, particularly in dense networks,\nbut requires complex set-ups to measure, whereas contact information is easier\nto measure but only allows for simplistic simulation models. In a contact trace\na lot of node movement information is irretrievably lost so the original\npositions and velocities are in general out of reach. We propose a fast\nheuristic algorithm, inspired by dynamic force-based graph drawing, capable of\ninferring a plausible movement from any contact trace, and evaluate it on both\nsynthetic and real-life contact traces. Our results reveal that (i) the quality\nof the inferred mobility is directly linked to the precision of the measured\ncontact trace, and (ii) the simple addition of appropriate anticipation forces\nbetween nodes leads to an accurate inferred mobility."

Due to the highly dynamic nature of the\nunderlying vehicular network topology, we depart from architectures requiring\ncentralized coordination, reliable MAC scheduling, or global network state\nknowledge, and instead adopt a distributed paradigm with simple protocols. In\nother words, we investigate the problem of reliable dissemination from multiple\nsources when each node in the network shares a limited amount of its resources\nfor cooperating with others. By using \\emph{rateless} coding at the Road Side\nUnit (RSU) and using vehicles as data carriers, we describe an efficient way to\nachieve reliable dissemination to all nodes (even disconnected clusters in the\nnetwork). In the nutshell, we explore vehicles as mobile storage devices. We\nthen develop a method to keep the density of the rateless codes packets as a\nfunction of distance from the RSU at the desired level set for the target\ndecoding distance. We investigate various tradeoffs involving buffer size,\nmaximum capacity, and the mobility parameter of the vehicles."

In general deployment links of up to 5 miles (8 km) from\nthe base station are possible, but distance is typically limited to about 1.5\nmiles due to rain fading attenuation constraints.

For a given\nregion, we aim to obtain a deterministic placement of sensors which, apart from\nensuring that the entire region comes under the purview of at least a single\nsensor, minimises the number of sensors utilised. We begin by considering\nregions devoid of obstacles and thus having every location amenable for\nplacement.

We recognise two distinct classes of obstacles, namely\ntransparent and opaque obstacles, which are distinguished by their ability (or\nthe lack of it) to permit sensing radiation through them.

    "summary": "An important aspect of the Future Internet is the efficient utilization of\n(wireless) network resources. In order for the - demanding in terms of QoS -\nFuture Internet services to be provided, the current trend is evolving towards\nan \"integrated\" wireless network access model that enables users to enjoy\nmobility, seamless access and high quality of service in an all-IP network on\nan \"Anytime, Anywhere\" basis. The term \"integrated\" is used to denote that the\nFuture Internet wireless \"last mile\" is expected to comprise multiple\nheterogeneous geographically coexisting wireless networks, each having\ndifferent capacity and coverage radius. The efficient management of the\nwireless access network resources is crucial due to their scarcity that renders\nwireless access a potential bottleneck for the provision of high quality\nservices. In this paper we propose an auction mechanism for allocating the\nbandwidth of such a network so that efficiency is attained, i.e. social welfare\nis maximized. In particular, we propose an incentive-compatible, efficient\nauction-based mechanism of low computational complexity. We define a repeated\ngame to address user utilities and incentives issues. Subsequently, we extend\nthis mechanism so that it can also accommodate multicast sessions. We also\nanalyze the computational complexity and message overhead of the proposed\nmechanism. We then show how user bids can be replaced from weights generated by\nthe network and transform the auction to a cooperative mechanism capable of\nprioritizing certain classes of services and emulating DiffServ and time-of-day\npricing schemes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by simulations that\nassess the proposed mechanisms properties and performance. We finally provide\nsome concluding remarks and directions for future research."

However, its use\nrequires a certain number of exchanges between the clients and a TURN server\nbefore establishing the multimedia sessions and this increase the latent time.\nIn this article, we propose to adapt TURN protocol for applications based on\nSIP protocol such as telephony over Internet, conference video, etc. This\nadaptation optimises the establishment of multimedia sessions by integrating a\nmanager of TCP connections and multimedia flow controller into SIP Proxy\nserver."

    "summary": "VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) are highly mobile wireless ad hoc networks\nand will play an important role in public safety communications and commercial\napplications. Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly\nchanging topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Conventional routing\nprotocols in MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) are unable to fully address the\nunique characteristics in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose EBGR\n(Edge Node Based Greedy Routing), a reliable greedy position based routing\napproach to forward packets to the node present in the edge of the transmission\nrange of source/forwarding node as most suitable next hop, with consideration\nof nodes moving in the direction of the destination. We propose Revival\nMobility model (RMM) to evaluate the performance of our routing technique. This\npaper presents a detailed description of our approach and simulation results\nshow that packet delivery ratio is improved considerably compared to other\nrouting techniques of VANET."

    "summary": "The traditional TCP congestion control mechanism encounters a number of new\nproblems and suffers a poor performance when the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is\nused in multihop ad hoc networks. Many of the problems result from medium\ncontention at the MAC layer. In this paper, I first illustrate that severe\nmedium contention and congestion are intimately coupled, and TCP s congestion\ncontrol algorithm becomes too coarse in its granularity, causing throughput\ninstability and excessively long delay. Further, we illustrate TCP s severe\nunfairness problem due to the medium contention and the tradeoff between\naggregate throughput and fairness. Then, based on the novel use of channel\nbusyness ratio, a more accurate metric to characterize the network utilization\nand congestion status, I propose a new wireless congestion control protocol\n(WCCP) to efficiently and fairly support the transport service in multihop ad\nhoc networks. In this protocol, each forwarding node along a traffic flow\nexercises the internode and intranode fair resource allocation and determines\nthe MAC layer feedback accordingly. The endtoend feedback, which is ultimately\ndetermined by the bottleneck node along the flow, is carried back to the source\nto control its sending rate. Extensive simulations show that WCCP significantly\noutperforms traditional TCP in terms of channel utilization, delay, and\nfairness, and eliminates the starvation problem."

    "summary": "Distributed contention based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are the\nfundamental components for IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Local Area Networks\n(WLANs). Contention windows (CW) change dynamically to adapt to the current\ncontention level, Upon each packet collision, a station doubles its CW to\nreduce further collision of packets. IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination\nFunction (DCF) suffers from a common problem in erroneous channel. They cannot\ndistinguish noise lost packets from collision lost packets. In both situations\na station does not receive its ACK and doubles the CW to reduce further packet\ncollisions. This increases backoff overhead unnecessarily in addition to the\nnoise lost packets, reduces the throughput significantly. Furthermore, the\naggregate throughput of a practical WLAN strongly depends on the channel\nconditions. In real radio environment, the received signal power at the access\npoint from a station is subjected to deterministic path loss, shadowing and\nfast multipath fading. In this paper, we propose a new saturation throughput\nanalysis for IEEE 802.11 DCF considering erroneous channel and capture effects.\nTo alleviate the low performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF, we introduce a mechanism\nthat greatly outperforms under noisy environment with low network traffic and\ncompare their performances to the existing standards. We extend the\nmultidimensional Markov chain model initially proposed by Bianchi(3) to\ncharacterize the behavior of DCF in order to account both real channel\nconditions and capture effects, especially in a high interference radio\nenvironment."

    "summary": "WLAN localization has become an active research field recently. Due to the\nwide WLAN deployment, WLAN localization provides ubiquitous coverage and adds\nto the value of the wireless network by providing the location of its users\nwithout using any additional hardware. However, WLAN localization systems\nusually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN\nlocalization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the\nsignal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in\nthe site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements\nand calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this\npaper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate\nactive and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN\nlocalization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low\ncomputational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high\naccuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of\ndiffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing\neffect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing\nbuilding models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the\nuser's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to\nreduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and\ndescribe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve\nits goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show\nthat the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum\naverage absolute error of 3.18 dBm achieving a maximum localization error of\n2.44m for both the device-based and device-free cases."

The mobile grids exhibit stronger challenges\nlike mobility management of devices, providing transparent access to grid\nresources, task management and handling of limited resources so that resources\nare shared efficiently. Task execution on these devices should not be affected\nby their mobility. The proposed work presents performance evaluation of\nwireless mobile grid using normal walk mobility model. The normal walk model\nrepresents daily motion of users and the direction of motion is mostly\nsymmetric in a real life environment, thus it is effective in location updating\nof a mobile station and in turn helps task distribution among these available\nmobile stations. Some of the performance parameters such as Task Execution\nTime, task failure rate, communication overhead on Brokering Server and\nMonitoring Cost are discussed."

Novel expressions for the\nspectral efficiency and average BER of the proposed adaptive FSO system are\npresented and performance investigations under various turbulence conditions\nand target BER requirements are carried out. Numerical results indicate that\nsignificant spectral efficiency gains are offered without increasing the\ntransmitted average optical power or sacrificing BER requirements, in\nmoderate-to-strong turbulence conditions.

    "summary": "Channel properties influence the development of wireless communication\nsystems. Unlike wired channels that are stationary and predictable, radio\nchannels are extremely random and dont offer easy analysis. A Radio Propagation\nModel (RPM), also known as the Radio Wave Propagation Model (RWPM), is an\nempirical mathematical formulation for the characterization of radio wave\npropagation as a function of frequency. In mobile radio systems, path loss\nmodels are necessary for proper planning, interference estimations, frequency\nassignments and cell parameters which are the basic for network planning\nprocess as well as Location Based Services (LBS) techniques. Propagation models\nthat predict the mean signal strength for an arbitrary transmitter receiver (T\nR) separation distance which is useful in estimating the radio coverage area of\na transmitter are called large scale propagation models, since they\ncharacterize signal strength over large TR separation distances. In this paper,\nthe large scale propagation performance of Okumura, Hata, and Lee models has\nbeen compared varying Mobile Station (MS) antenna height, Transmitter Receiver\n(TR) distance and Base Station (BS) antenna height, considering the system to\noperate at 900 MHz.

Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is\nthe standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wireless\nnetwork with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned to\nperform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostly\nbecause of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks are\nplagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes,\nmultipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP over\nsuch connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet loss\nor delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm.\nIn this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high Bit\nError rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model is\nimplemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2)."

    "summary": "Initially TCP was designed with the notion in mind that wired networks are\ngenerally reliable and any segment loss in a transmission is due to congestion\nin the network rather than an unreliable medium (The assumptions is that the\npacket loss caused by damage is much less than 1 percent) . This notion doesnt\nhold in wireless parts of the network. Wireless links are highly unreliable and\nthey lose segments all the time due to a number of factors. Very few papers are\navailable which uses TCP for MANET. In this paper, an attempt have been made to\njustify the use of TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) for loss of packet due to\nrandom noise introduces in the MANET. For the present analysis the simulation\nhas been carried out for TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) by introduces 0, 10, 20\nand 30 percent noise. The comparison of TCP variants is made by running\nsimulation for 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent of data packet loss due to noise in the\ntransmission link and the effect of throughput and congestion window has been\nexamined. During the simulation we have observed that throughput has been\ndecreased when a drop of multiple segments happens, further we have observed in\nthe case of TCP variant (Reno) throughput is better at 1 percent (Figure 5)\nwhich implies a network with short burst of error and low BER, causing only one\nsegment to be lost. When multiple segments are lost due to error prone nature\nof link, Tahoe perform better than Reno (Figure 13), that gives a significant\nsaving of time (64.28 percent) in comparison with Reno (Table 4). Several\nsimulations have been run with ns 2 simulator in order to acquire a better\nunderstanding of these TCP variants and the way they perform their function. We\nconclude with a discussion of whether these TCP versions can be used in Mobile\nAd hoc Network."

The key idea is to interconnect various\ncomputation modules (IP cores) in a network fashion and transport packets\nsimultaneously across them, thereby gaining performance. In addition to\nimproving performance by having multiple packets in flight, NoCs also present a\nhost of other advantages including scalability, power efficiency, and component\nreuse through modular design. This work focuses on design and development of\nhigh performance communication architectures for FPGAs using NoCs Once\ncompletely developed, the above methodology could be used to augment the\ncurrent FPGA design flow for implementing multicore SoC applications. We design\nand implement an NoC framework for FPGAs, MultiClock OnChip Network for\nReconfigurable Systems (MoCReS). We propose a novel microarchitecture for a\nhybrid two layer router that supports both packetswitched communications,\nacross its local and directional ports, as well as, time multiplexed\ncircuitswitched communications among the multiple IP cores directly connected\nto it. Results from place and route VHDL models of the advanced router\narchitecture show an average improvement of 20.4 percent in NoC bandwidth\n(maximum of 24 percent compared to a traditional NoC). We parameterize the\nhybrid router model over the number of ports, channel width and bRAM depth and\ndevelop a library of network components (MoClib Library).

    "summary": "The design and development of a complex system requires an adequate\nmethodology and efficient instrumental support in order to early detect and\ncorrect anomalies in the functional and non-functional properties of the tested\nprotocols. Among the various tools used to provide experimental support for\nsuch developments, network emulation relies on real-time production of\nimpairments on real traffic according to a communication model, either\nrealistically or not.\n  This paper aims at simply presenting to newcomers in network emulation\n(students, engineers, ...) basic principles and practices illustrated with a\nfew commonly used tools. The motivation behind is to fill a gap in terms of\nintroductory and pragmatic papers in this domain.\n  The study particularly considers centralized approaches, allowing cheap and\neasy implementation in the context of research labs or industrial developments.\nIn addition, an architectural model for emulation systems is proposed, defining\nthree complementary levels, namely hardware, impairment and model levels. With\nthe help of this architectural framework, various existing tools are situated\nand described. Various approaches for modeling the emulation actions are\nstudied, such as impairment-based scenarios and virtual architectures,\nreal-time discrete simulation and trace-based systems. Those modeling\napproaches are described and compared in terms of services and we study their\nability to respond to various designer needs to assess when emulation is\nneeded."

    "summary": "Dynamic Spectrum Access systems exploit temporarily available spectrum\n(`white spaces') and can spread transmissions over a number of non-contiguous\nsub-channels. Such methods are highly beneficial in terms of spectrum\nutilization. However, excessive fragmentation degrades performance and hence\noff-sets the benefits. Thus, there is a need to study these processes so as to\ndetermine how to ensure acceptable levels of fragmentation. Hence, we present\nexperimental and analytical results derived from a mathematical model. We model\na system operating at capacity serving requests for bandwidth by assigning a\ncollection of gaps (sub-channels) with no limitations on the fragment size. Our\nmain theoretical result shows that even if fragments can be arbitrarily small,\nthe system does not degrade with time. Namely, the average total number of\nfragments remains bounded. Within the very difficult class of dynamic\nfragmentation models (including models of storage fragmentation), this result\nappears to be the first of its kind. Extensive experimental results describe\nbehavior, at times unexpected, of fragmentation under different algorithms. Our\nmodel also applies to dynamic linked-list storage allocation, and provides a\nnovel analysis in that domain. We prove that, interestingly, the 50% rule of\nthe classical (non-fragmented) allocation model carries over to our model.\nOverall, the paper provides insights into the potential behavior of practical\nfragmentation algorithms."

There are many schemes that can be applied to MIMO systems\nsuch as space time block codes, space time trellis codes, and the Vertical Bell\nLabs Space-Time Architecture (V-BLAST). This paper proposes a novel signal\ndetector scheme called MIMO detectors to enhance the performance in MIMO\nchannels. We study the general MIMO system, the general V-BLAST architecture\nwith Maximum Likelihood (ML), Zero- Forcing (ZF), Minimum Mean- Square Error\n(MMSE), and Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) detectors and\nsimulate this structure in Rayleigh fading channel. Also compares the\nperformances of MIMO system with different modulation techniques in Fading and\nAWGN channels. Base on frame error rates and bit error rates, we compare the\nperformance and the computational complexity of these schemes with other\nexistence model.Simulations shown that V-BLAST implements a detection\ntechnique, i.e. SIC receiver, based on ZF or MMSE combined with symbol\ncancellation and optimal ordering to improve the performance with lower\ncomplexity, although ML receiver appears to have the best SER performance-BLAST\nachieves symbol error rates close to the ML scheme while retaining the\nlowcomplexity nature of the V-BLAST."

However, the users sharing this limited bandwidth have been\nincreasing considerably.Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) is a new\ntechnology by which the capacity of existing mobile communication systems can\neconomically be increased. This paper has been presented how the capacity can\nbe enhanced by using SDMA with smart antennas in mobile communications system.\nBased on Adaptive Antenna Array (AAA) technology the spatial dimension of the\nexisting system is exploited by means of forming independent radio beams in\neach of the original channels. This paper analyses the comparison of average\nBit Error Rate (BER) of SDMA and CDMA technique and the different ways in which\nSDMA can be introduced to increase the capacity of a cellular system. The\nprobability of error is found for a standard omni directional base station\nantenna, and another set of curves is found for flat top beam having a\ndirectivity of 5.1dB. It is assumed that k separate flat top beams can be\nformed by base station and pointed each of the k users within the cell of\ninterest. Noticing that for an average probability of error greater than 0.1 in\na propagation path loss environment of n=4, the flat top beam will support 200\nusers, whereas the omni-directional antenna will support only 50 users. This\nincrease the number of user is roughly equal to the directivity offered by the\nflat top beam system, and illustrates the promise SDMA offers for improving\ncapacity in wireless system.

This approach to load\nbalancing contrasts with traditional approaches where clients make smart server\nselections upon arrival (e.g., Join-the-Shortest-Queue policy and variants\nthereof).

Energy wastage can be caused by failed\npacket transmission attempts at each node due to channel dynamics and\ninterference. Therefore transmission control techniques that are unaware of the\nchannel dynamics can lead to suboptimal channel use patterns. In this paper we\npropose a transmission controller that utilizes different \"grades\" of channel\nside information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while\nmeeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission\nqueue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel. We are\nspecifically interested in the case where the transmitter has low-grade channel\nside information that can be obtained based solely on the ACK/NAK sequence for\nthe previous transmissions. Our scheduler is readily implementable and it is\nbased on the dynamic programming solution to the finite-horizon transmission\ncontrol problem. We also calculate the information theoretic capacity of the\nfinite state Markov channel with feedback containing different grades of\nchannel side information including that, obtained through the ACK/NAK sequence.\nWe illustrate that our scheduler achieves a given throughput at a power level\nthat is fairly close to the fundamental limit achievable over the channel."

    "summary": "In a network, arrival process is converted into departure process through\nnetwork elements. The departure process suffer propagation delay in the link,\nprocessing delay at the network elements like router and data loss due to\nbuffer overflow or congestion. For providing guaranteed service resources need\nto be reserved before conversation takes place. To reserve such resources\nestimation of them are indispensable. The idea of service curve gives\nbeforehand deterministic value of these parameters. In this paper, we aim to\nminimum and maximum buffer space required in the router, minimum link capacity\nrequired to guarantee a pre-specified end-to-end delay for an ongoing session\nin a wired-cum-wireless scenario by analyzing minimum and maximum service\ncurve. We assume that the network we are analyzing is an IP based mobile\nnetwork. The findings of the work are presented in the form of tables which can\nbe used for resource reservation to offer quality service to end-users."

    "summary": "The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a data dimensionality reduction\ntechnique well-suited for processing data from sensor networks. It can be\napplied to tasks like compression, event detection, and event recognition. This\ntechnique is based on a linear transform where the sensor measurements are\nprojected on a set of principal components. When sensor measurements are\ncorrelated, a small set of principal components can explain most of the\nmeasurements variability. This allows to significantly decrease the amount of\nradio communication and of energy consumption. In this paper, we show that the\npower iteration method can be distributed in a sensor network in order to\ncompute an approximation of the principal components. The proposed\nimplementation relies on an aggregation service, which has recently been shown\nto provide a suitable framework for distributing the computation of a linear\ntransform within a sensor network. We also extend this previous work by\nproviding a detailed analysis of the computational, memory, and communication\ncosts involved. A compression experiment involving real data validates the\nalgorithm and illustrates the tradeoffs between accuracy and communication\ncosts."

To enable position-based routing, a\nnode must be able to discover the location of the messages' destination node.\nThis task is typically accomplished by a location service. Recently, several\nlocation service protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. In this\npaper we propose a novel location service called PHLS: Predictive Hierarchical\nLocation Service. In PHLS, the entire network is partitioned into a hierarchy\nof smaller and smaller regions. For each node, one node in each-level region of\nthe hierarchy is chosen as its local location server. When the network\ninitializes or when a node attaches the network, nodes contact their local\nlocation server with their current location information (ie. position and\nvelocity). Then, they only need to update their location server when they move\naway from their current region. Finally, nodes query their location servers and\nget the exact or predicted location of destination nodes."

We assume\nan ideal physical channel and therefore neglect the blocking of connection\nrequests due to the physical impairments. The problem formulation includes\nsuitable constraints that enable the algorithm to balance the load among the\nindividuals and thus results in a lower blocking probability and lower mean\nexecution time than the existing bio-inspired algorithms available in the\nliterature for the DRWA problems. Three types of wavelength assignment\ntechniques, such as First fit, Random, and Round Robin wavelength assignment\ntechniques have been investigated here. The ability to guarantee both low\nblocking probability without any wavelength converters and small delay makes\nthe improved algorithm very attractive for current optical switching networks."

Several routing algorithms have been introduced for\nrouting of packets from source to destination. Some of them route packets\naccurately with increased workload and some of them drastically cut down the\nworkload. A few of them can find out a minimum workload deviation for both UDP\nand TCP packets. We simulated these approaches in a well defined simulator,\nanalyzed and evaluated their performance. After expanding our analysis with\nvarying weights and number of paths we found that the recently proposed routing\nalgorithm Mixed Weighted Fair Routing (MWFR) outperforms the existing routing\nalgorithms by reducing the routing and network overhead and saving the scarce\nbandwidth as well as CPU consumption for packet switching networks."

With the development of Internet, Multicast\nis widely applied in all kinds of multimedia real-time application: distributed\nmultimedia systems, collaborative computing, video-conferencing, distance\neducation, etc. In order to construct a delay-constrained multicast routing\ntree, average distance heuristic (ADH) algorithm is analyzed firstly. Then a\ndelay-constrained algorithm called DCADH (delay-constrained average distance\nheuristic) is presented. By using ADH a least cost multicast routing tree can\nbe constructed; if the path delay can't meet the delay upper bound, a shortest\ndelay path which is computed by Dijkstra algorithm will be merged into the\nexisting multicast routing tree to meet the delay upper bound.

In past, some researchers tried to attach\nratings to the peers itself but it was complex and less effective. In this\npaper, a novel P2P architecture is proposed which attaches ratings to the\nuploaded document directly. These ratings then become as <Rating> element in\nits XML advertisement which has several child elements for information\nclassification. The attached <Rating> element is extracted from the\nadvertisement in real time and the document is then sorted accordingly.\nTherefore, the information can be easily sorted based on a request by a peer\naccording to the relevance of matter. The information regarding relevance is\nobtained by the peer issuing the query. This research leads to a smart P2P\nmodel, the Rated-Resource P2P network (R2P2P)."

    "summary": "In wireless mesh networks such as WLAN (IEEE 802.11s) or WMAN (IEEE 802.11),\neach node should help to relay packets of neighboring nodes toward gateway\nusing multi-hop routing mechanisms. Wireless mesh networks usually intensively\ndeploy mesh nodes to deal with the problem of dead spot communication. However,\nthe higher density of nodes deployed, the higher radio interference occurred.\nThis causes significant degradation of system performance. In this paper, we\nfirst convert network problems into geometry problems in graph theory, and then\nsolve the interference problem by geometric algorithms. We first define line\nintersection in a graph to reflect radio interference problem in a wireless\nmesh network. We then use plan sweep algorithm to find intersection lines, if\nany; employ Voronoi diagram algorithm to delimit the regions among nodes; use\nDelaunay Triangulation algorithm to reconstruct the graph in order to minimize\nthe interference among nodes. Finally, we use standard deviation to prune off\nthose longer links (higher interference links) to have a further enhancement.\nThe proposed hybrid solution is proved to be able to significantly reduce\ninterference in a wireless mesh network in O(n log n) time complexity."

To keep the stability\nof the whole network, congestion control algorithms have been extensively\nstudied. Queue management method employed by the routers is one of the\nimportant issues in the congestion control study. Active queue management (AQM)\nhas been proposed as a router-based mechanism for early detection of congestion\ninside the network. In this paper we analyzed several active queue management\nalgorithms with respect to their abilities of maintaining high resource\nutilization, identifying and restricting disproportionate bandwidth usage, and\ntheir deployment complexity. We compare the performance of FRED, BLUE, SFB, and\nCHOKe based on simulation results, using RED and Drop Tail as the evaluation\nbaseline.

However, they often use the cryptography to secure\nrouting functionalities. The cryptography alone is not enough to defend against\nmultiple attacks due to the node compromise. Therefore, we need more\nalgorithmic solutions. In this report, we focus on the behavior of routing\nprotocols to determine which properties make them more resilient to attacks.\nOur aim is to find some answers to the following questions. Are there any\nexisting protocols, not designed initially for security, but which already\ncontain some inherently resilient properties against attacks under which some\nportion of the network nodes is compromised? If yes, which specific behaviors\nare making these protocols more resilient? We propose in this report an\noverview of security strategies for WSNs in general, including existing attacks\nand defensive measures. In this report we focus at the network layer in\nparticular, and an analysis of the behavior of four particular routing\nprotocols is provided to determine their inherent resiliency to insider\nattacks. The protocols considered are: Dynamic Source Routing (DSR),\nGradient-Based Routing (GBR), Greedy Forwarding (GF) and Random Walk Routing\n(RWR)."

For the case of fountain codes relaying, it has been\nshown previously that introducing diversity is also beneficial since it\ncounteracts transmission losses on the channel. Instead of simply hop-by-hop\nforwarding information, each sensor node diversifies the information flow using\nXOR combinations of stored packets. This approach has been shown to be\nefficient for random linear fountain codes. However, random linear codes\nexhibit high decoding complexity.

Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly\nchanging topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Position based routing\nprotocols are becoming popular due to advancement and availability of GPS\ndevices. One of the critical issues of VANETs are frequent path disruptions\ncaused by high speed mobility of vehicle that leads to broken links which\nresults in low throughput and high overhead . This paper argues the use of\ninformation on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed\nof vehicles) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence.\nSo in this paper we propose a Reliable Directional Greedy routing (RDGR), a\nreliable position based routing approach which obtains position, speed and\ndirection of its neighboring nodes from GPS. This approach incorporates\npotential score based strategy, which calculates link stability between\nneighbor nodes in distributed fashion for reliable forwarding of data packet."

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive analytical study of two competitive\ncognitive operators' spectrum leasing and pricing strategies, taking into\naccount operators' heterogeneity in leasing costs and users' heterogeneity in\ntransmission power and channel conditions. We model the interactions between\noperators and users as a three-stage dynamic game, where operators make\nsimultaneous spectrum leasing and pricing decisions in Stages I and II, and\nusers make purchase decisions in Stage III. Using backward induction, we are\nable to completely characterize the game's equilibria. We show that both\noperators make the equilibrium leasing and pricing decisions based on simple\nthreshold policies. Moreover, two operators always choose the same equilibrium\nprice despite their difference in leasing costs. Each user receives the same\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at the equilibrium, and the obtained payoff is\nlinear in its transmission power and channel gain. We also compare the duopoly\nequilibrium with the coordinated case where two operators cooperate to maximize\ntheir total profit. We show that the maximum loss of total profit due to\noperators' competition is no larger than 25%. The users, however, always\nbenefit from operators' competition in terms of their payoffs. We show that\nmost of these insights are robust in the general SNR regime."

    "summary": "The development of mobile devices (CPU, memory, and storage) and the\nintroduction of mobile networks (Ad-Hoc, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 3.5G) have opened\nnew opportunities for next generation of mobile services. It becomes more\nconvenience and desirable for mobile internet users to be connected everywhere.\nHowever, ubiquitous mobile access connectivity faces interoperation issues\nbetween wireless network providers and wireless network technologies. Although\nmobile users would like to get as many services as possible while they travel,\nthere is a lack of technology to identify visited users in current foreign\nnetwork authentication systems. This challenge lies in the fact that a foreign\nnetwork provider does not initially have the authentication credentials of a\nmobile user. Existing approaches use roaming agreement to exchange\nauthentication information between home network and foreign network. This paper\nproposes a roaming agreement-less approach designed based on our ubiquitous\nmobile access model. Our approach consist of two tokens, Passport\n(identification token) and Visa (authorisation token) to provide the mobile\nuser with a flexible authentication method to access foreign network services.\nThe security analysis indicates that our proposal is more suitable for\nubiquitous mobile communication especially in roaming agreement-less\nenvironment."

    "summary": "Mobile operators currently prefer optimizing their radio networks via\nre-homing or cutting over the cell sites in 2G or 3G networks. The core\nnetwork, as the parental part of radio network, is inevitably impacted by the\nre-homing in radio domain. This paper introduces the cell site re-homing in\nradio network and analyzes its impact on the performance of GSM/UMTS core\nnetwork. The possible re-homing models are created and analyzed for core\nnetworks. The paper concludes that appropriate re-homing in radio domain, using\ncorrect algorithms, not only optimizes the radio network but also helps improve\nthe QoS of the core network and saves the carriers' OPEX and CAPEX on their\ncore networks."

    "summary": "During the last three decades the Internet has experienced fascinating\nevolution, both exponential growth in traffic and rapid expansion in topology.\nThe size of the Internet becomes enormous, yet the network is very `small' in\nthe sense that it is extremely efficient to route data packets across the\nglobal Internet. This paper provides a brief review on three fundamental\nproperties of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems (AS) level.\nFirstly the Internet has a power-law degree distribution, which means the\nmajority of nodes on the Internet AS graph have small numbers of links, whereas\na few nodes have very large numbers of links. Secondly the Internet exhibits a\nproperty called disassortative mixing, which means poorly-connected nodes tend\nto link with well-connected nodes, and vice versa. Thirdly the best-connected\nnodes, or the rich nodes, are tightly interconnected with each other forming a\nrich-club. We explain that it is these structural properties that make the\nglobal Internet so 'small'."

    "summary": "Bandwidth request-grant mechanisms are used in 802.16 networks to manage the\nuplink bandwidth needs of subscriber stations (SSs). Requests may be sent by\nSSs to the base station (BS) by means of several mechanisms defined in the\nstandard. Based on the incoming requests, the BS (which handles most of the\nbandwidth scheduling in the system) schedules the transmission of uplink\ntraffic, by assigning transmission opportunities to the SSs in an\nimplementation-dependent manner. In this paper we present a study of some\nbandwidth allocation issues, arising from the management of the perception of\nsubscriber stations' bandwidth needs at the base station. We illustrate how the\nbandwidth perception varies depending on the policy used to handle requests and\ngrants. By means of ns-2 simulations, we evaluate the potential impact of such\npolicies on the system's aggregate throughput when the traffic is composed of\nBest-Effort TCP flows."

In blind opportunistic\nrouting protocols, where transmitters blindly broadcast without knowledge of\nthe surrounding nodes, two fundamental design parameters are the node\ntransmission probability and the transmission spectral efficiency. In this\npaper these parameters are selected to maximize end-to-end performance,\ncharacterized by the product of transmitter density, hop distance and rate. Due\nto the intractability of the problem as stated, an approximation function is\nexamined which proves reasonably accurate.

This\ndemand has led to a number of routing protocols which efficiently utilize the\nlimited resources available at the sensor nodes. Most of these protocols are\neither based on single hop routing or multi hop routing and typically find the\nminimum energy path without addressing other issues such as time delay in\ndelivering a packet, load balancing, and redundancy of data. Response time is\nvery critical in environment monitoring sensor networks where typically the\nsensors are stationary and transmit data to a base station or a sink node.

    "summary": "Two-ray ground reflection model has been widely used as the propagation model\nto investigate the performance of an ad hoc network. But two-ray model is too\nsimple to represent a real world network. A more realistic model namely\nshadowing propagation model has been used in this investigation. Under\nshadowing propagation model, a mobile node may receive a packet at a signal\nlevel that is below a required threshold level. This low signal level affects\nthe routing protocol as well as the medium access control protocol of a\nnetwork. An analytical model has been presented in this paper to investigate\nthe shadowing effects on the network performance. The analytical model has been\nverified via simulation results. Simulation results show that the performance\nof a network becomes very poor if shadowing propagation model is used in\ncompare to the simple two-ray model. Two solutions have also been proposed in\nthis paper to overcome the effects of shadowing. One solution is a physical\nlayer solution and the other one is a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer\nsolution. Simulation results show that these two solutions reduce the shadowing\neffect and improve network performance."

    "summary": "In multi-hop wireless systems, the need for cooperation among nodes to relay\neach other's packets exposes them to a wide range of security attacks. A\nparticularly devastating attack is the wormhole attack, where a malicious node\nrecords control traffic at one location and tunnels it to another compromised\nnode, possibly far away, which replays it locally. Routing security in ad hoc\nnetworks is often equated with strong and feasible node authentication and\nlightweight cryptography. Unfortunately, the wormhole attack can hardly be\ndefeated by crypto graphical measures, as wormhole attackers do not create\nseparate packets. They simply replay packets already existing on the network,\nwhich pass the cryptographic checks. Existing works on wormhole detection have\noften focused on detection using specialized hardware, such as directional\nantennas, etc. In this paper, we present a cluster based counter-measure for\nthe wormhole attack, that alleviates these drawbacks and efficiently mitigates\nthe wormhole attack in MANET. Simulation results on MATLab exhibit the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting wormhole attacks."

    "summary": "Wireless networks are a common place nowadays and almost all of the modern\ndevices support wireless communication in some form. These networks differ from\nmore traditional computing systems due to the ad-hoc and spontaneous nature of\ninteractions among devices. These systems are prone to security risks, such as\neavesdropping and require different techniques as compared to traditional\nsecurity mechanisms. Recently, secure device pairing in wireless environments\nhas got substantial attention from many researchers. As a result, a significant\nset of techniques and protocols have been proposed to deal with this issue.\nSome of these techniques consider devices equipped with infrared, laser,\nultrasound transceivers or 802.11 network interface cards; while others require\nembedded accelerometers, cameras and/or LEDs, displays, microphones and/or\nspeakers. However, many of the proposed techniques or protocols have not been\nimplemented at all; while others are implemented and evaluated in a stand-alone\nmanner without being compared with other related work [1]. We believe that it\nis because of the lack of specialized tools that provide a common platform to\ntest the pairing methods. As a consequence, we designed such a tool. In this\npaper, we are presenting design and development of the Pairing Simulator (PSim)\nthat can be used to perform the analysis of device pairing methods."

    "summary": "Mobile ip (mip) is an internet protocol that allows mobile nodes to have\ncontinuous network connectivity to the internet without changing their ip\naddresses while moving to other networks. The packets sent from correspondent\nnode (cn) to a mobile node (mn) go first through the mobile node's home agent\n(ha), then the ha tunnels them to the mn's foreign network. One of the main\nproblems in the original mip is the triangle routing problem. Triangle routing\nproblem appears when the indirect path between cn and mn through the ha is\nlonger than the direct path. This paper proposes a new technique to improve the\nperformance of the original mip during the handoff. The proposed technique\nreduces the delay, the packet loss and the registration time for all the\npackets transferred between the cn and the mn. In this technique, tunneling\noccurs at two levels above the ha in a hierarchical network. To show the\neffectiveness of the proposed technique, it is compared with the original mip\nand another technique for solving the same problem in which tunneling occurs at\none level above the ha. Simulation results presented in this paper are based on\nthe ns2 mobility software on linux platform. The simulations results show that\nour proposed technique achieves better performance than the others, considering\nthe packet delay, the packet losses during handoffs and the registration time,\nin different scenarios for the location of the mn with respect to the ha and\nfas."

    "summary": "The applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) contain a wide variety of\nscenarios. In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of\nnodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly\nconnected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications.\nRouting protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in\nthe network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly\ndepends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.\nThis paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between\nsensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of\narbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the\nnetwork (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing\npreservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs\nno extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers\nnew routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path\nfrom a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node\ndecides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and\nneighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the\nrouting path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not\nas serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc\nrouting. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as\nfar as possible in WSN."

    "summary": "Due to mobility in Ad-Hoc network the topology of the network may change\nrandomly, rapidly and unexpectedly, because of these aspects, the routes in the\nnetwork often disappear and new to arise. To avoid frequent route discovery and\nroute failure EAOMDV was proposed based on existing routing protocol AOMDV. The\nEAOMDV (Enhanced Ad-Hoc on Demand Multipath Distance Vector) Routing protocol\nwas proposed to solve the \"route failure\" problem in AOMDV. EAOMDV protocol\nreduces the route failure problem by preemptively predicting the link failure\nby the signal power received by the receiver (pr). This proposed protocol\ncontrols overhead, increases throughput and reduces the delay. The EAOMDV\nprotocol was implemented on NS-2 and evaluation results show that the EAOMDV\noutperformed AOMDV."

From\nthe existing work done so far, we can examine that there is no combined\nsolution of multi-channel assignment with routing and congestion control. In\nthis paper, we propose a congestion control routing protocol along with\nmulti-channel assignment. We use a traffic aware metric in this protocol in\norder to provide quality of service. The proposed protocol can improve the\nthroughput and channel utilization to very high extent because it provides\nsolution for multi-channel assignment and congestion control. The proposed\nalgorithm assigns the channels in a way that, congestion is avoided and\nco-channel interference levels among links with same channel are reduced. By\nour simulation results in NS2, we show that the proposed protocol attains high\nthroughput and channel utilization along with reduced latency."

In this paper\nvarious aspects of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. Again, we\ntried to make every possible consideration with respect to south Asia i.e. how\nmass people of this region may be benefited. As a result, it might be regarded\nas a good source in case of making major BWA deployment decisions in this\nregion. Besides these, it also opens the path for further research and in depth\nthinking in this issue."

While the invention of each of such\nspecialized systems has improved the user experience, some fundamental\nshortcomings of these systems have often been neglected. These shortcomings of\ncontent distribution systems have become severe bottlenecks in scalability of\nthe internet.In order to combine the desired features of classical Content\nDistribution Networks (CDNs) and P2P/seed sharing based networks, we propose a\nhybrid CDN structure with a P2P/seed sharing based streaming protocol in the\naccess network .

Then we study low-power MAC protocols proposed/investigated for WBAN\nwith emphasis on their strengths and weaknesses. We also review different\npower-efficient mechanisms for WBAN.

    "summary": "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) based Medium Access Control (MAC)\nprotocols have received a good deal of attention as researchers look to enhance\noverall performance of Ad Hoc networks by leveraging multi antenna enabled\nnodes. To date such MAC protocols have been evaluated through comparative\nsimulation based studies that report on the number of concurrent links the\nprotocol can support. However, a bound on the maximum number of concurrent\nlinks (MNCL) that a MIMO based MAC protocol should strive to achieve has\nhitherto been unavailable. In this paper we present a theoretical formulation\nfor calculating the bound on the MNCL in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) where\nthe nodes have multiple antenna capability, while guaranteeing a minimum\nQuality of Service (QoS). In an attempt to make our findings as practical and\nrealistic as possible, the study incorporates models for the following PHY\nlayer and channel dependent elements: (a) path loss and fast fading effects, in\norder to accurately model adjacent link interference; (b) a Minimum Mean\nSquared Error (MMSE) based detector in the receiver which provides a balance\nbetween completely nulling of neighboring interference and hardware complexity.\nIn calculating the bound on the MNCL our work also delivers the optimal power\ncontrol solution for the network as well as the optimal link selection. The\nresults are readily applicable to MIMO systems using Receive Diversity, Space\nTime Block Coding (STBC), and Transmit Beamforming and show that with a 4\nelement antenna system, as much as 3x improvement in the total number of\nconcurrent links can be achieved relative to a SISO based network. The results\nalso show diminishing improvement as the number of antennas is increased beyond\n4, and the maximum allowable transmit power is increased beyond 10 dBm (for the\nsimulated parameters)."

Two sets\nof statistical analyses are performed; the first examines the underlying\nencounter relationships in mobile societies, and the second evaluates DTN\nrouting in mobile peer-to-peer networks using trust and selfishness models. We\nfind that for the analyzed trace, trust filters are stable in terms of growth\nwith time (3 filters have close to 90% overlap of users over a period of 9\nweeks) and the results produced by different filters are noticeably different.\nIn our analysis for trust and selfishness model, our trust filters largely undo\nthe effect of selfishness on the unreachability in a network.

In this paper we propose SHIELD, an on-campus emergency rescue and\nalert management service. It is a fully distributed infrastructure-less\nplatform based on proximity-enabled trust and cooperation. It relies on\nlocalized responses, sent using Bluetooth and/or WiFi on the fly to achieve\nminimal response time and maximal availability thereby augmenting the\ntraditional notion of emergency services. Analysis of campus crime statistics\nand WLAN traces surprisingly show a strong positive correlation (over 55%)\nbetween on-campus crime statistics and spatio-temporal density distribution of\non-campus mobile users. This result provides a motivation to develop such\nplatform and points to the promise in reducing crime incidences.

    "summary": "Study on human mobility is gaining increasing attention from the research\ncommunity with its multiple applications to use in mobile networks,\nparticularly for the purpose of message delivery in the Delay Tolerant\nNetworks. To better understand the potential of mobile nodes as message relays,\nour study investigates the encounter pattern of mobile devices. Specifically,\nwe examine the extensive network traces that reflect mobility of communication\ndevices. We analyze the periodicity in encounter pattern by using power\nspectral analysis. Strong periodicity was observed among rarely encountering\nmobile nodes while the periodicity was weaker among frequently encountering\nnodes. Further, we present a method to search regularly encountering pairs and\ndiscuss the findings. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the\nperiodicity of encounter pattern with large network traces, which is a critical\nbasis for designing an efficient delivery scheme using mobile nodes."

    "summary": "The Call admission control (CAC) is one of the Radio Resource Management\n(RRM) techniques plays instrumental role in ensuring the desired Quality of\nService (QoS) to the users working on different applications which have\ndiversified nature of QoS requirements. This paper proposes a fuzzy neural\napproach for call admission control in a multi class traffic based Next\nGeneration Wireless Networks (NGWN). The proposed Fuzzy Neural Call Admission\nControl (FNCAC) scheme is an integrated CAC module that combines the linguistic\ncontrol capabilities of the fuzzy logic controller and the learning\ncapabilities of the neural networks .The model is based on Recurrent Radial\nBasis Function Networks (RRBFN) which have better learning and adaptability\nthat can be used to develop the intelligent system to handle the incoming\ntraffic in the heterogeneous network environment. The proposed FNCAC can\nachieve reduced call blocking probability keeping the resource utilisation at\nan optimal level. In the proposed algorithm we have considered three classes of\ntraffic having different QoS requirements. We have considered the heterogeneous\nnetwork environment which can effectively handle this traffic. The traffic\nclasses taken for the study are Conversational traffic, Interactive traffic and\nback ground traffic which are with varied QoS parameters. The paper also\npresents the analytical model for the CAC .The paper compares the call blocking\nprobabilities for all the three types of traffic in both the models. The\nsimulation results indicate that compared to Fuzzy logic based CAC,\nConventional CAC, The simulation results are optimistic and indicates that the\nproposed FNCAC algorithm performs better where the call blocking probability is\nminimal when compared to other two methods."

    "summary": "Optical MINs hold great promise and have advantages over their electronic\nnetworks.they also hold their own challenges. More research has been done on\nElectronic Multistage Interconnection Networks, (EMINs) but these days optical\ncommunication is a good networking choice to meet the increasing demands of\nhigh-performance computing communication applications for high bandwidth\napplications. The electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks (EMINs) and\nthe Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks (OMINs) have many similarities,\nbut there are some fundamental differences between them such as the\noptical-loss during switching and the crosstalk problem in the optical\nswitches. To reduce the negative effect of crosstalk, various approaches which\napply the concept of dilation in either the space or time domain have been\nproposed. With the space domain approach, extra SEs are used to ensure that at\nmost one input and one output of every SE will be used at any given time. For\nan Optical network without crosstalk, it is needed to divide the messages into\nseveral groups, and then deliver the messages using one time slot (pass) for\neach group, which is called the time division multiplexing. This Paper\ndiscusses the permutation passability behavior of optical MINs. The bandwidth\nof optical MINs with or without crosstalk has also been explained. The results\nthus obtained shows that the performance of the networks improves by allowing\ncrosstalk to some extent."

As the mobility of vehicles and driver behavior can\nbe affected by network messages, these tools must include a vehicle mobility\nmodel integrated with a quality network simulator. We present the first\nimplementation of a well-known vehicle mobility model to ns-3, the next\ngeneration of the popular ns-2 networking simulator. Vehicle mobility and\nnetwork communication are integrated through events. User-created event\nhandlers can send network messages or alter vehicle mobility each time a\nnetwork message is received and each time vehicle mobility is updated by the\nmodel. To aid in creating simulations, we have implemented a straight highway\nmodel that manages vehicle mobility, while allowing for various user\ncustomizations. We show that the results of our implementation of the mobility\nmodel matches that of the model's author and provide an example of using our\nimplementation in ns-3."

    "summary": "All-Optical Network (AON) is a network where the user-network interface is\noptical and the data does undergo optical to electrical conversion within the\nnetwork. AONs are attractive because they promise very high rates, flexible\nswitching and broad application support. There are two technologies for AON:\nWavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) and Optical Time Division Multiplexed\n(OTDM). OTDM transmission systems are becoming increasingly important as one of\nthe key technologies satisfying the growing demand for large capacity optical\nnetworks. Although OTDM has several advantages in terms of operation system,\nsuch as natural accommodation of higher bit rate payloads, it introduces many\nsecurity vulnerabilities, which do not exist in traditional networks. One of\nthe serious problems with OTDM is the fact that optical crosstalk is additive,\nand thus the aggregate effect of crosstalk over a whole all-optical network\n(AON) may be more nefarious than a single point of crosstalk. This is because\ncrosstalk can spread rapidly through the network, causing additional awkward\nfailures and triggering multiple undesirable alarms. This results in the\ncontinuous monitoring and identification of the impairments becoming\nchallenging in the event of transmission failures. In this paper we propose a\nnovel approach for detecting and localizing crosstalk in OTDM transmission\nsystems that can participate in some tasks for fault management in optical\nnetwork."

    "summary": "An increasingly important requirement for many novel applications is sensing\nthe positions of people, equipment, etc. GPS technology has proven itself as a\nsuccessfull technology for positioning in outdoor environments but indoor no\ntechnology has yet gained a similar wide-scale adoption. A promising indoor\npositioning technique is radio-based location fingerprinting, having the major\nadvantage of exploiting already existing radio infrastructures, like IEEE\n802.11, which avoids extra deployment costs and effort. The research goal of\nthis thesis is to address the limitations of current indoor location\nfingerprinting systems. In particular the aim is to advance location\nfingerprinting techniques for the challenges of handling heterogeneous clients,\nscalability to many clients, and interference between communication and\npositioning. The wireless clients used for location fingerprinting are\nheterogeneous even when only considering clients for the same technology.\nHeterogeneity is a challenge for location fingerprinting because it severely\ndecreases the precision of location fingerprinting. To support many clients\nlocation fingerprinting has to address how to scale estimate calculation,\nmeasurement distribution, and distribution of position estimates. This is a\nchallenge because of the number of calculations involved and the frequency of\nmeasurements and position updates. Positioning using location fingerprinting\nrequires the measurement of, for instance, signal strength for nearby base\nstations. However, many wireless communication technologies block communication\nwhile collecting such measurements. This interference is a challenge because it\nis not desirable that positioning disables communication. An additional goal is\nto improve the conceptual foundation of location fingerprinting. A better\nfoundation will aid researchers to better survey and design location\nfingerprinting systems."

To\nevaluate this solution, we designed a file transfer software using a FEC\nencoding. Results show the sequencer optimal behavior and the file transfer\nefficiency, as a single download generates only little more overhead than TCP .\nMoreover, download time is almost independent of the number of receivers, and\nis already faster than TCP with 2 competing downloads."

    "summary": "Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) based Medium Access Control (MAC)\nprotocols have been proposed to enable concurrent communications and improve\nlink throughput in Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Ad Hoc networks. For the\nmost part, the works appearing in the literature make idealized and simplifying\nassumptions about the underlying physical layer as well as some aspects of the\nlink adaptation protocol. The result is that the performance predicted by such\nworks may not necessarily be a good predictor of actual performance in a fully\ndeployed system. In this paper we look to introduce elements into the SDMA MAC\nconcept that would allow us to better predict their performance under realistic\noperating conditions. Using a generic SDMA-MAC we look at how the network sum\nthroughput changes with the introduction of the following: $(a)$ use of the\nmore practical MMSE algorithm instead of the zero-forcing or SVD based nulling\nalgorithms used for receive beamnulling; $(b)$ impact of channel estimation\nerrors; $(c)$ introduction of link adaptation mechanism specifically designed\nfor concurrent SDMA MACs; $(d)$ incorporation of TX beamforming along with RX\nbeamnulling. Following on the transmission window during which concurrent\ntransmissions are allowed by the MAC, we qualify the impact of each of these\nfour elements in isolation. At the conclusion, the performance of a system that\nincorporates elements $a-d$ is presented and compared against the baseline\nsystem, showing an improvement of up to 5x in the overall network sum\nthroughput."

    "summary": "Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) wireless communication link has been\ntheoretically proven to be reliable and capable of achieving high capacity.\nHowever, these two advantageous characteristics tend to be addressed separately\nin many major researches. Researches on various approaches to attain both\ncharacteristics in a single MIMO system are still on-going and an established\napproach is yet to be concluded. To address this problem, in this paper a\nVertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (V-BLAST) MIMO enhanced with\nRate-Compatible Convolutional (RCPC) codes with Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum\nMean Squared Error (MMSE)-based detection is proposed. The analytical BER of\nthe system is presented and numerically analyzed. The system performance is\nanalyzed in Nakagami-m fading channel, which provides accuracy and flexibility\nin matching the signals statistics compared to other fading models. The\ncomplexity which arises in the calculations of the RCPC codes parameters is\nsignificantly reduced by using equivalent convolutional codes. Results show\nthat the use of high-rate code allows for bandwidth efficiency and at the same\ntime does not severely degrades the system performance. It is also shown that\nthe MMSE-based system outperforms the conventional ZF-based system especially\nin the low Eb/N0 region and in severe fading conditions."

Modification of the set\npartitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) image coder is proposed to generate\nfour different groups of bit-stream relative to its significances. The\nsignificant bits, the sign bits, the set bits and the refinement bits are\ntransmitted in four different groups. The proposed method for reducing the PAPR\nutilizes twice the unequal error protection (UEP), using the Read-Solomon codes\n(RS), in conjunction with bit-rate allocation and selective interleaving to\nprovide minimum PAPR. The output bit-stream from the source code (SPIHT) will\nbe started by the most significant types of bits (first group of bits). The\noptimal unequal error protection (UEP) of the four groups is proposed based on\nthe channel destortion. The proposed structure provides significant improvement\nin bit error rate (BER) performance. Performed computer simulations have shown\nthat the proposed scheme outperform the performance of most of the recent PAPR\nreduction techniques in most cases. Moreover, the simulation results indicate\nthat the proposed scheme provides significantly better PSNR performance in\ncomparison to well-known robust coding schemes."

    "summary": "The area of mobile ad hoc networking has received considerable attention of\nthe research community in recent years. These networks have gained immense\npopularity primarily due to their infrastructure-less mode of operation which\nmakes them a suitable candidate for deployment in emergency scenarios like\nrelief operation, battlefield etc., where either the pre-existing\ninfrastructure is totally damaged or it is not possible to establish a new\ninfrastructure quickly. However, MANETs are constrained due to the limited\ntransmission range of the mobile nodes which reduces the total coverage area.\nSometimes the infrastructure-less ad hoc network may be combined with a fixed\nnetwork to form a hybrid network which can cover a wider area with the\nadvantage of having less fixed infrastructure. In such a combined network, for\ntransferring data, we need base stations which act as gateways between the\nwired and wireless domains. Due to the hybrid nature of these networks, routing\nis considered a challenging task. Several routing protocols have been proposed\nand tested under various traffic conditions. However, the simulations of such\nrouting protocols usually do not consider the hybrid network scenario. In this\nwork we have carried out a systematic performance study of the two prominent\nrouting protocols: Destination Sequenced Distance Vector Routing (DSDV) and\nDynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols in the hybrid networking environment. We\nhave analyzed the performance differentials on the basis of three metrics -\npacket delivery fraction, average end-to-end delay and normalized routing load\nunder varying pause time with different number of sources using NS2 based\nsimulation."

Our approach is inspired by\nthe adversarial queuing theory, which is amended in order to model wireless\ncommunication. More precisely, there is an adversary that specifies\ntransmission rates of wireless links and injects data in such a way that an\naverage number of data injected in a single round and routed through a single\nwireless link is at most $r$, for a given $r\\in (0,1)$. We also assume that the\nadditional \"burst\" of data injected during any time interval and scheduled via\na single link is bounded by a given parameter $b$.\n  Under this scenario, we show that the nodes following so called {\\em\nwork-conserving} scheduling policies, not necessarily the same, are guaranteed\nstability (i.e., bounded queues) and reasonably small data latency (i.e.,\nbounded time on data delivery), for injection rates $r<1/d$, where $d$ is the\nmaximum length of a routing path. Furthermore, we also show that such a bound\nis asymptotically optimal on $d$."

    "summary": "Throughput improvement of the Wireless LANs has been a constant area of\nresearch. Most of the work in this area, focuses on designing throughput\noptimal schemes for fully connected networks (no hidden nodes). But, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed schemes, though perform optimally in fully\nconnected network, achieve significantly lesser throughput even than that of\nstandard IEEE 802.11 in a network with hidden nodes. This motivates the need\nfor designing schemes that provide near optimal performance even when hidden\nnodes are present. The primary reason for the failure of existing protocols in\nthe presence of hidden nodes is that these protocols are based on the model\ndeveloped by Bianchi. However this model does not hold when hidden nodes exist.\nMoreover, analyzing networks with hidden nodes is still an open problem. Thus,\ndesigning throughput optimal schemes in networks with hidden nodes is\nparticularly challenging. The novelty of our approach is that it is not based\non any underlying mathematical model, rather it directly tunes the control\nvariables so as to maximize the throughput. We demonstrate that this model\nindependent approach achieves maximum throughput in networks with hidden\nterminals as well. Apart from this major contribution, we present stochastic\napproximation based algorithms for achieving weighted fairness in a connected\nnetworks. We also present a throughput optimal exponential backoff based random\naccess algorithm. We demonstrate that the exponential backoff based scheme may\noutperform an optimal p-persistent scheme in networks with hidden terminals.\nThis demonstrates the merit of exponential backoff based random access schemes\nwhich was deemed unnecessary by results shown by Bianchi."

    "summary": "A new generation of \"behavior-aware\" delay tolerant networks is emerging in\nwhat may define future mobile social networks. With the introduction of novel\nbehavior-aware protocols, services and architectures, there is a pressing need\nto understand and realistically model mobile users behavioral characteristics,\ntheir similarity and clustering. Such models are essential for the analysis,\nperformance evaluation, and simulation of future DTNs. This paper addresses\nissues related to mobile user similarity, its definition, analysis and\nmodeling. To define similarity, we adopt a behavioral-profile based on users\nlocation preferences using their on-line association matrix and its SVD, then\ncalculate the behavioral distance to capture user similarity. This measures the\ndifference of the major spatio-temporal behavioral trends and can be used to\ncluster users into similarity groups or communities. We then analyze and\ncontrast similarity distributions of mobile user populations in two settings:\n(i) based on real measurements from four major campuses with over ten thousand\nusers for a month, and (ii) based on existing mobility models, including random\ndirection and time-varying community models. Our results show a rich set of\nsimilar communities in real mobile societies with distinct behavioral clusters\nof users. This is true for all the traces studied, with the trend being\nconsistent over time. Surprisingly, however, we find that the existing mobility\nmodels do not explicitly capture similarity and result in homogeneous users\nthat are all similar to each other. Thus the richness and diversity of user\nbehavioral patterns is not captured to any degree in the existing models. These\nfindings strongly suggest that similarity should be explicitly captured in\nfuture mobility models, which motivates the need to re-visit mobility modeling\nin the future."

This separation greatly favors architectural\nreusability. The pattern works well in the case of single-address space and not\nproven to be efficient for web applications involving multiple address spaces.\nWeb applications force the designers to decide which of the components of the\npattern are to be partitioned between the server and client(s) before the\ndesign phase commences. For any rapidly growing web application, it is very\ndifficult to incorporate future changes in policies related to partitioning.\nOne solution to this problem is to duplicate the Model and controller\ncomponents at both server and client(s). However, this may add further problems\nlike delayed data fetch, security and scalability issues. In order to overcome\nthis, a new architecture SPIM has been proposed that deals with the\npartitioning problem in an alternative way.

The camera is attached through an Ethernet connection and power\nsource. Therefore, the camera can be viewed from either standard Web browser or\ncell phone. Nowadays, when a security camera is installed, user is notified as\nlong as the camera is switched on since any slight movement requires the\nattention of the supervisor.

In this paper, we study this new protocol through packet-level\nsimulations, with a special focus on a performance comparison with other\nlower-than Best Effort protocols such as TCP-LP and TCP-NICE: our aim is indeed\nto quantify and relatively weight the level of Low-priority provided by such\nprotocols.\n  Our results show that LEDBAT transport generally achieves the lowest possible\nlevel of priority, with the default configurations of TCP-NICE and TCP-LP\nrepresenting increasing levels of aggressiveness. In addition, we perform a\ncareful sensitivity analysis of LEDBAT performance, by tuning its main\nparameters in both inter-protocol (against TCP) and intra-protocol (against\nLEDBAT itself) scenarios. In the inter-protocol case, although in case of\nmisconfiguration LEDBAT competes as aggressively as TCP, however we show that\nit is not possible to achieve an arbitrary level of low-priority by merely\ntuning its parameters. In the intra-protocol case, we show that coexistence of\nlegacy flows with slightly dissimilar settings, or experiencing different\nnetwork conditions, can result in significant unfairness."

A CR is a self-directed\nentity in a wireless communications environment that senses its environment,\ntracks changes, and reacts upon its findings and frequently exchanges\ninformation with the networks for secondary user (SU). However, CR facing\ncollision problem with tracks changes i.e. reallocating of other empty channels\nfor SU while PU arrives.

    "summary": "Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Network (DTN) protocols typically address sparse\nintermittently connected networks whereas Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET)\nprotocols address the fairly stable and fully connected ones. But many\nintermediate situations may occur on mobility dynamics or radio link\ninstability. In such cases, where the network frequently splits into evolving\nconnected groups, none of the conventional routing paradigms (DTN or MANET) are\nfully satisfactory. In this paper we propose HYMAD, a Hybrid DTN-MANET routing\nprotocol which uses DTN between disjoint groups of nodes while using MANET\nrouting within these groups. HYMAD is fully decentralized and only makes use of\ntopological information exchanges between the nodes. The strength of HYMAD lies\nin its ability to adapt to the changing connectivity patterns of the network.\nWe evaluate the scheme in simulation by replaying synthetic and real life\nmobility traces which exhibit a broad range of connectivity dynamics. The\nresults show that HYMAD introduces limited overhead and outperforms the\nmulti-copy Spray-and-Wait DTN routing protocol it extends, both in terms of\ndelivery ratio and delay. This hybrid DTN-MANET approach offers a promising\nvenue for the delivery of elastic data in mobile ad-hoc networks as it retains\nthe resilience of a \\textit{pure} DTN protocol while significantly improving\nperformance."

    "summary": "In this paper, we study the optimal secondary-link beamforming pattern that\nbalances between the SU's throughput and the interference it causes to PUs in\nMIMO cognitive radio networks. In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput\nof the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers\nbelow a certain threshold.\n  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the\nchannel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key\nchallenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary\nreceivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the\nsecondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels\nto the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,\nthe interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high\nprobability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to\ndeal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional\ncharacteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP\nformulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP\nformulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap\nwhen the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a\nrandomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution\nto the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we\nshow that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to primary\nreceivers, the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple\nmatrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more\nefficiently than solving the QCQP directly."

    "summary": "Multi-packet reception (MPR) has been recognized as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique for random-access wireless local area networks\n(WLANs). As is common with all random access protocols, the wireless channel is\noften under-utilized in MPR WLANs. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This\nwork complements the existing random-access methods that are based on\nsingle-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple\nchances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of\n``winning\" stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet\ntransmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to\nstop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution\ncorresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and\ncontention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to\ncharacterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An\ninteresting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple\nthreshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total\nnumber of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the\nconventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention\nscheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of\nthe channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back\nto single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case\nthe throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with\nsingle-round contention."

    "summary": "Adaptive OFDMA has recently been recognized as a promising technique for\nproviding high spectral efficiency in future broadband wireless systems. The\nresearch over the last decade on adaptive OFDMA systems has focused on adapting\nthe allocation of radio resources, such as subcarriers and power, to the\ninstantaneous channel conditions of all users. However, such \"fast\" adaptation\nrequires high computational complexity and excessive signaling overhead. This\nhinders the deployment of adaptive OFDMA systems worldwide. This paper proposes\na slow adaptive OFDMA scheme, in which the subcarrier allocation is updated on\na much slower timescale than that of the fluctuation of instantaneous channel\nconditions. Meanwhile, the data rate requirements of individual users are\naccommodated on the fast timescale with high probability, thereby meeting the\nrequirements except occasional outage. Such an objective has a natural chance\nconstrained programming formulation, which is known to be intractable. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we formulate safe tractable constraints for the\nproblem based on recent advances in chance constrained programming. We then\ndevelop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the\nreformulated problem. Our results show that the proposed slow adaptation scheme\ndrastically reduces both computational cost and control signaling overhead when\ncompared with the conventional fast adaptive OFDMA. Our work can be viewed as\nan initial attempt to apply the chance constrained programming methodology to\nwireless system designs. Given that most wireless systems can tolerate an\noccasional dip in the quality of service, we hope that the proposed methodology\nwill find further applications in wireless communications."

    "summary": "Thanks to its simplicity and cost efficiency, wireless local area network\n(WLAN) enjoys unique advantages in providing high-speed and low-cost wireless\nservices in hot spots and indoor environments. Traditional WLAN\nmedium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit\nat a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station cause the\ndestruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer\nmultiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive\nmultiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket\nreception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In\naddition, the paper provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to\nachieve the improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MPR as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique, we prove a \"super-linearity\" result, which\nstates that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability\nincreases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential\nbackoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR\nsystem, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability,\nthe number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the\nabove insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE\n802.11-like WLAN that incorporates advanced PHY-layer signal processing\ntechniques to implement MPR."

    "summary": "Wireless ad hoc networks are power constrained since nodes operate with\nlimited battery energy. Thus, energy consumption is crucial in the design of\nnew ad hoc routing protocols. In order to maximize the lifetime of ad hoc\nnetworks, traffic should be sent via a route that can be avoid nodes with low\nenergy. In addition, considering that the nodes of ad hoc networks are mobile,\nit is possible that a created path is broken because of nodes mobility and\nestablishment of a new path would be done again. This is because of sending\nadditional control packets, accordingly, energy consumption increases. Also, it\nshould avoid nodes which have more buffered packets. Maybe, because of long\nqueue, some of these packets are dropped and transmitted again. This is the\nreason for wasting of energy. In this paper we propose a new energy efficient\nalgorithm, that uses a new cost function and avoid nodes with characteristics\nwhich mentioned above.

Researchers found\nthat cognitive radio (CR) technology may resolve the spectrum scarcity. CR\nnetwork proved to next generation wireless communication system that proposed\nas a way to reuse under-utilised spectrum of licensee user (primary network) in\nan opportunistic and non-interfering basis. A CR is a self-configuring entity\nin a wireless networking that senses its environment, tracks changes, and\nfrequently exchanges information with their networks.

However, CRAHN\nfacing challenges and condition become worst while tracks changes i.e.\nreallocation of another under-utilised channels while primary network user\narrives.

    "summary": "Inferring plausible node mobility based only on information from wireless\ncontact traces is a difficult problem. Working with mobility information allows\nricher protocol simulations, particularly in dense networks, but requires\ncomplex set-ups to measure. On the other hand, contact information is easier to\nmeasure but only allows for simplistic simulation models. In a contact trace a\nlot of node movement information is irretrievably lost so the original\npositions and velocities are in general out of reach. In this paper, we propose\na fast heuristic algorithm, inspired by dynamic force-based graph drawing,\ncapable of inferring a plausible movement from any contact trace, and evaluate\nit on both synthetic and real-life contact traces. Our results reveal that (i)\nthe quality of the inferred mobility is directly linked to the precision of the\nmeasured contact trace, and (ii) the simple addition of appropriate\nanticipation forces between nodes leads to an accurate inferred mobility."

This is done in two\nphases 1) Preliminary Data Collection- During this phase sink node collects\nenough data so that it can build up ARIMA model for each node. Then sink node\nselects a model for the particular node and sends back the corresponding model\nparameters to the node and also keeps them with it. Selecting the model for a\nnode there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and accuracy of prediction.\nSo we choose the model according to C = {\\alpha} xMAE + (1 - {\\alpha}) x rtran\n0=< {\\alpha} =<1 where the model should minimize C. Here MAE is Mean Absolute\nError which is normalized by some predefined error tolerance and rtran is the\nratio of number of samples transmitted over total number of samples. 2)\nAdaptive Data Collection- After the sensor node has received the model\nparameters it checks each actual data value with the data value calculated from\nthe parameters received. If there is deviation beyond some predefined error\ntolerance then only it sends the original data value to the sink node."

This work\npresents NetFence, a scalable DoS-resistant network architecture. NetFence uses\na novel mechanism, secure congestion policing feedback, to enable robust\ncongestion policing inside the network. Bottleneck routers update the feedback\nin packet headers to signal congestion, and access routers use it to police\nsenders' traffic. Targeted DoS victims can use the secure congestion policing\nfeedback as capability tokens to suppress unwanted traffic. When compromised\nsenders and receivers organize into pairs to congest a network link, NetFence\nprovably guarantees a legitimate sender its fair share of network resources\nwithout keeping per-host state at the congested link. We use a Linux\nimplementation, ns-2 simulations, and theoretical analysis to show that\nNetFence is an effective and scalable DoS solution: it reduces the amount of\nstate maintained by a congested router from per-host to at most per-(Autonomous\nSystem)."

Consequently, the concept of using\nnodes with energy replenishment capabilities has been gaining popularity.\nHowever, new techniques and protocols must be developed to maximize the\nperformance of sensor networks with energy replenishment. Here, we analyze\nlimits of the performance of sensor nodes with limited energy, being\nreplenished at a variable rate. We provide a simple localized energy management\nscheme that achieves a performance close to that with an unlimited energy\nsource, and at the same time keeps the probability of complete battery\ndischarge low. Based on the insights developed, we address the problem of\nenergy management for energy-replenishing nodes with finite battery and finite\ndata buffer capacities. To this end, we give an energy management scheme that\nachieves the optimal utility asymptotically while keeping both the battery\ndischarge and data loss probabilities low."

    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks are collections of large number of sensor nodes. The\nsensor nodes are featured with limited energy, computation and transmission\npower. Each node in the network coordinates with every other node in forwarding\ntheir packets to reach the destination. Since these nodes operate in a\nphysically insecure environment; they are vulnerable to different types of\nattacks such as selective forwarding and sinkhole. These attacks can inject\nmalicious packets by compromising the node. Geographical routing protocols of\nwireless sensor networks have been developed without considering the security\naspects against these attacks. In this paper, a secure routing protocol named\nsecured greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol (S-GPSR) is proposed for\nmobile sensor networks by incorporating trust based mechanism in the existing\ngreedy perimeter stateless routing protocol (GPSR). Simulation results prove\nthat S-GPSR outperforms the GPSR by reducing the overhead and improving the\ndelivery ratio of the networks."

    "summary": "Environmental monitoring is often performed through a wireless sensor\nnetwork, whose nodes are randomly deployed over the geographical region of\ninterest. Sensors sample a physical phenomenon (the so-called field) and send\ntheir measurements to a {\\em sink} node, which is in charge of reconstructing\nthe field from such irregular samples. In this work, we focus on scenarios of\npractical interest where the sensor deployment is unfeasible in certain areas\nof the geographical region, e.g., due to terrain asperities, and the delivery\nof sensor measurements to the sink may fail due to fading or to transmission\ncollisions among sensors simultaneously accessing the wireless medium. Under\nthese conditions, we carry out an asymptotic analysis and evaluate the quality\nof the estimation of a d-dimensional field when the sink uses linear filtering\nas a reconstruction technique. Specifically, given the matrix representing the\nsampling system, V, we derive both the moments and an expression of the\nlimiting spectral distribution of VV*, as the size of V goes to infinity and\nits aspect ratio has a finite limit bounded away from zero. By using such\nasymptotic results, we approximate the mean square error on the estimated field\nthrough the eta-transform of VV*, and derive the sensor network performance\nunder the conditions described above."

    "summary": "With recent advances in wireless communication, networking, and low power\nsensor technology, wireless sensor network (WSN) systems have begun to take\nsignificant roles in various applications ranging from environmental sensing to\nmobile healthcare sensing. While some WSN applications only require a lim- ited\namount of bandwidth, new emerging applications operate with a notice- ably\nlarge amount of data transfers. One way to deal with such applications is to\nmaximize the available capacity by utilizing the use of multiple wireless\nchannels. This work proposes DynaChannAl, a distributed dynamic wireless\nchannel algorithm with the goal of effectively distributing nodes on multiple\nwireless channels in WSN systems. Specifically, DynaChannAl targets applica-\ntions where mobile nodes connect to a pre-existing wireless backbone and takes\nthe expected end-to-end queuing delay as its core metric. We use the link qual-\nity indicator (LQI) values provided by IEEE 802.15.4 radios white-list\npotential links with good link quality and evaluate such links with the\naggregated packet transmission latency at each hop. Our approach is useful for\napplications that require minimal end-to-end delay (i.e., healthcare\napplications). DynaChannAl is a light weight and highly adoptable scheme that\ncan be easily incorporated with various pre-developed components and\npre-deployed applications. We eval- uate DynaChannAl in on a 45 node WSN\ntestbed. As the first study to consider end-to-end latency as the core metric\nfor channel allocation in WSN systems, the experimental results indicate that\nDynaChannAl successfully distributes multi- ple (mobile) source nodes on\ndifferent wireless channels and enables the nodes to select wireless channel\nand links that can minimize the end-to-end latency."

    "summary": "The paper has two objectives. The first is to study rigorously the transient\nbehavior of some P2P networks whenever information is replicated and\ndisseminated according to epidemic-like dynamics. The second is to use the\ninsight gained from the previous analysis in order to predict how efficient are\nmeasures taken against peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. We first introduce a\nstochastic model which extends a classical epidemic model and characterize the\nP2P swarm behavior in presence of free riding peers. We then study a second\nmodel in which a peer initiates a contact with another peer chosen randomly. In\nboth cases the network is shown to exhibit a phase transition: a small change\nin the parameters causes a large change in the behavior of the network. We\nshow, in particular, how the phase transition affects measures that content\nprovider networks may take against P2P networks that distribute non-authorized\nmusic or books, and what is the efficiency of counter-measures."

    "summary": "Given the respective advantages of the two complimentary techniques for\npeer-to-peer media streaming (namely tree-based push and mesh-based pull),\nthere is a strong trend of combining them into a hybrid streaming system.\nBacked by recently proposed mechanisms to identify stable peers, such a hybrid\nsystem usually consists of backbone trees formed by the stable peers and other\noverlay structures in the second tier to accommodate the remaining peers. In\nthis paper, we embrace the hybrid push-pull structure for peer-to-peer media\nstreaming. Our protocol is dominated by a multi-tree push mechanism to minimize\nthe delay in the backbone and is complemented by other overlay structures to\ncope with peer dynamics. What mainly distinguishes our multi-tree pushing from\nthe conventional ones is an unbalanced tree design guided by the so called\nsnow-ball streaming, which has a provable minimum delay and can be smoothly\n\"melded\" with virtually any other existing overlay structures lying in the\nsecond tier. We design algorithms to construct and maintain our SNowbAll\nmulti-tree Pushing (SNAP) overlay, and we also illustrate how to smoothly weld\nthe SNAP backbone with the second tier. Finally, we perform simulations in\nns-2; the results indicate that our approach outperforms a recently proposed\nhybrid streaming system."

    "summary": "One of the big challenges in ad hoc network design is packet routing. Studies\nhave shown that on-demand routing protocols perform better than table-driven\nrouting protocols. In order to avoid route discovery for each packet, on-demand\nrouting protocols cache routes previously learnt. A node in ad hoc network\nlearns routing information by overhearing or forwarding packets to other nodes\nand keep learned routes in its route cache. However, node movement results\nbroken links and therefore increases risk of cache pollution. Ensuring cache\nfreshness in on-demand routing protocols, therefore, presents a serious\nchallenge. A lot of research has been done in route cache organization,\nhowever, little effort has been done for route cache timeout policy to prevent\nstale routes from being used. In this paper we propose a new cross-layer\nframework to improve route cache performance in on-demand routing protocols.\nThe proposed framework presents novel use of Received Signal Strength Indicator\n(RSSI) information to choose cache timeout of individual links in route cache."

    "summary": "Loss tomography has received considerable attention in recent years and a\nnumber of estimators have been proposed. Unfortunately, almost all of them are\ndevoted to the tree topology despite the general topology is more common in\npractice. In addition, most of the works presented in the literature rely on\niterative approximation to search for the maximum of a likelihood function\nformed from observations, which have been known neither scalable nor efficient.\nIn contrast to the tree topology, there is few paper dedicated to the general\ntopology because of the lack of understanding the impacts created by the probes\nsent by different sources. We in this paper present the analytical results\nobtained recently for the general topology that show the correlation created by\nthe probes sent by multiple sources to a node located in an intersection of\nmultiple trees. The correlation is expressed by a set of polynomials of the\npass rates of the paths connecting the sources to the node. In addition to the\nexpression, a closed form solution is proposed to obtain the MLE of the pass\nrates of the paths connecting the sources to the node. Then, two strategies are\nproposed to estimate the loss rate of a link for the general topology: one is\npath-based and the other is link-based, depending on whether we need to obtain\nthe pass rate of a path first. The two strategies are compared in the context\nof the general topology that shows each has its advantages and the link-based\none is more general. Apart from proving the estimates obtained are the MLEs, we\nprove the estimator presented here has the optimal asymptotic property."

In this paper, we propose a new\ncross-layer broadcast scheme to minimize broadcast traffic in mobile ad hoc\nnetworks.

Within such a\nframework, we can determine both the Pareto-optimal performance bounds and the\nnetworking parameters that provide these bounds. The originality of this\napproach is that it accounts for the inherent broadcast properties of the\ntransmission and finely models the interference distribution. In the proposed\nmodel, the network performance can be optimized when several flows (source-\ndestination transmissions) exist. One benefit of our approach is that the\ncomplexity does not grow with the number of flows. The other major contribution\nof this paper is the new analytical formulation of the performance metrics. It\nrelies on a matrix representation of the constraints imposed by the\ninterference- limited and broadcast wireless channel. Because of the similarity\nof this matrix with a Markovian transition matrix, we can exploit classical\nresults from Markov chains theory to derive steady state performance metrics\nrelative to capacity, robustness, energy and delay. Another very interesting\nfeature of these new metrics is that the Pareto-optimal solutions related to\nthem provide a tight bound on capacity, robustness, energy and delay."

    "summary": "In this paper an improved version of the graded precision localization\nalgorithm GRADELOC, called IGRADELOC is proposed. The performance of GRADELOC\nis dependent on the regions formed by the overlapping radio ranges of the nodes\nof the underlying sensor network. A different region pattern could\nsignificantly alter the nature and precision of localization. In IGRADELOC, two\nimprovements are suggested. Firstly, modifications are proposed in the radio\nrange of the fixed-grid nodes, keeping in mind the actual radio range of\ncommonly available nodes, to allow for routing through them. Routing is not\naddressed by GRADELOC, but is of prime importance to the deployment of any\nadhoc network, especially sensor networks. A theoretical model expressing the\nradio range in terms of the cell dimensions of the grid infrastructure is\nproposed, to help in carrying out a deployment plan which achieves the\ndesirable precision of coarse-grained localization. Secondly, in GRADELOC it is\nobserved that fine-grained localization does not achieve significant\nperformance benefits over coarse-grained localization. In IGRADELOC, this\nfactor is addressed with the introduction of a parameter that could be used to\nimprove and fine-tune the precision of fine-grained localization."

    "summary": "We study the problem of tracking an object moving through a network of\nwireless sensors. In order to conserve energy, the sensors may be put into a\nsleep mode with a timer that determines their sleep duration. It is assumed\nthat an asleep sensor cannot be communicated with or woken up, and hence the\nsleep duration needs to be determined at the time the sensor goes to sleep\nbased on all the information available to the sensor. Having sleeping sensors\nin the network could result in degraded tracking performance, therefore, there\nis a tradeoff between energy usage and tracking performance. We design sleeping\npolicies that attempt to optimize this tradeoff and characterize their\nperformance. As an extension to our previous work in this area [1], we consider\ngeneralized models for object movement, object sensing, and tracking cost. For\ndiscrete state spaces and continuous Gaussian observations, we derive a lower\nbound on the optimal energy-tracking tradeoff. It is shown that in the low\ntracking error regime, the generated policies approach the derived lower bound."

    "summary": "It is well known that links in CSMA wireless networks are prone to\nstarvation. Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.\nIn this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also\nsusceptible to temporal starvation. Specifically, although some links have good\nequilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can\nstill have no throughput for extended periods from time to time. Given its\nimpact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize\ntemporal starvation. To this end, we develop a \"trap theory\" to analyze\ntemporal throughput fluctuation. The trap theory serves two functions. First,\nit allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the\ntransient behavior of CSMA networks. For example, we show that the duration of\na trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the\ndistributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration)\nin the CSMA protocol. Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the\n\"degrees of starvation\" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,\ngiven a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and\nif so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of\ntemporal starvation can also be computed. We believe that the ability to\nidentify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will\nserve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for\nit."

    "summary": "A fundamental choice in femtocell deployments is the set of users which are\nallowed to access each femtocell. Closed access restricts the set to\nspecifically registered users, while open access allows any mobile subscriber\nto use any femtocell. Which one is preferable depends strongly on the distance\nbetween the macrocell base station (MBS) and femtocell. The main results of the\npaper are lemmas which provide expressions for the SINR distribution for\nvarious zones within a cell as a function of this MBS-femto distance. The\naverage sum throughput (or any other SINR-based metric) of home users and\ncellular users under open and closed access can be readily determined from\nthese expressions. We show that unlike in the uplink, the interests of home and\ncellular users are in conflict, with home users preferring closed access and\ncellular users preferring open access. The conflict is most pronounced for\nfemtocells near the cell edge, when there are many cellular users and fewer\nfemtocells. To mitigate this conflict, we propose a middle way which we term\nshared access in which femtocells allocate an adjustable number of time-slots\nbetween home and cellular users such that a specified minimum rate for each can\nbe achieved. The optimal such sharing fraction is derived. Analysis shows that\nshared access achieves at least the overall throughput of open access while\nalso satisfying rate requirements, while closed access fails for cellular users\nand open access fails for the home user."

Nonetheless, most of\nthe previous studies on this subject have either held unrealistic assumptions\nabout the network properties, thus making them basically theoretical, or have\notherwise been limited to fairly simple network topologies. We, on the other\nhand, believe to have devised a novel scheme, called Real Amplitude Scaling\n(RAS), that relaxes the aforementioned restrictions, and works with a wider\nrange of network topologies and in circumstances that are closer to practice,\nfor instance in lack of symbol-level synchronization and in the presence of\nnoise, channel distortion and severe interference from other sources. The\nsimulation results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method in\nlow SNRs, as well as the high SNR limits, where the effect of quantization\nerror in the digital techniques becomes comparable to the channel."

We consider the scenario in which\nthe scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information,\nbut instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memory\ninherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from the\nscheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1)\nChannel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rate\nof the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediate\nrate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. The\nscheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the\nclassic 'exploitation vs exploration' trade-off that is difficult to quantify.\nWe therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit\nProcesses (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's\nindexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index\npolicy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality\nproperties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink scheduling\nunder imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive the\nWhittle's index policy in closed form. Via extensive numerical experiments, we\nshow that the index policy has near-optimal performance.\n  Our work reveals that, under incomplete channel state information, exploiting\nchannel memory for opportunistic scheduling can result in significant\nperformance gains and that almost all of these gains can be realized using an\neasy-to-implement index policy."

The\nreliability needed for continuous operation of an AN is difficult to achieve\nthrough completely infrastructure-less mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper we\nfirst propose an architecture for an AN where airborne networking platforms\n(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. In this\narchitecture, the ANPs can be viewed as mobile base stations and the combat\naircrafts on a mission as mobile clients. The combat aircrafts on a mission\nmove through a space called air corridor. The goal of the AN design is to form\na backbone network with the ANPs with two properties: (i) the backbone network\nremains connected at all times, even though the topology of the network changes\nwith the movement of the ANPs, and (ii) the entire 3D space of the air corridor\nis under radio coverage at all times by the continuously moving ANPs.\n  In addition to proposing an architecture for an AN, the contributions of the\npaper include, development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and\ntransmission range of the ANPs so that the dynamically changing backbone\nnetwork remains connected at all times, development of a routing algorithm that\nensures a connection between the source-destination node pair with the fewest\nnumber of path switching, given the dimensions of the air corridor and the\nradius of the coverage sphere associated with an ANP, development of an\nalgorithm that finds the fewest number of ANPs required to provide complete\ncoverage of the air corridor at all times, development of an algorithm that\nprovides connected-coverage to the air corridor at all times, and development\nof a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the ANPs and the\nresulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network."

ECR-MAC requires only a single half-duplex radio transceiver\non each node that integrates the spectrum sensing at physical (PHY) layer and\nthe packet scheduling at MAC layer. In addition to explicit frequency\nnegotiation which is adopted by conventional multichannel MAC protocols,\nECR-MAC introduces lightweight explicit time negotiation. This two-dimensional\nnegotiation enables ECR-MAC to exploit the advantage of both multiple channels\nand TDMA, and achieve aggressive power savings by allowing nodes that are not\ninvolved in communication to go into doze mode. The IEEE 802.11 standard allows\nfor the use of multiple channels available at the PHY layer, but its MAC\nprotocol is designed only for a single channel. A single channel MAC protocol\ndoes not work well in a multichannel environment, because of the multichannel\nhidden terminal problem.

    "summary": "In P2P systems, large volumes of data are declustered naturally across a\nlarge number of peers. But it is very difficult to control the initial data\ndistribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other\nusers. The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across\nmultiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content\ndistribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.\nThe demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the\nsource of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access\nlatency and the network traffic. In addition to this, due to the intrinsic\ndynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to\nguarantee good load balancing. If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to\nincreased user response time and significant performance degradation of the\nsystem. Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases\nand it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication. In this\npaper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing\nin peer-to-peer content distribution systems. In addition to an intelligent\nreplica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing\ntechnique. In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped\ninto strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises\navailable capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size. In order to\nachieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and\ninter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed. We are able to show that\nour proposed architecture attains less latency and better throughput with\nreduced bandwidth usage, through the simulation results."

    "summary": "Achieving optimal transmission throughput in data networks in a multi-hop\nwireless networks is fundamental but hard problem. The situation is aggravated\nwhen nodes are mobile. Further, multi-rate system make the analysis of\nthroughput more complicated. In mobile scenario, link may break or be created\nas nodes are moving within communication range. `Route Discovery' which is to\nfind the optimal route and transmission schedule is an important issue. Route\ndiscovery entails some cost; so one would not like to initiate discovery too\noften. On the other hand, not discovering reasonably often entails the risk of\nbeing stuck with a suboptimal route and/or schedule, which hurts end-to-end\nthroughput. The implementation of the routing decision problem in one\ndimensional mobile ad hoc network as Markov decision process problem is already\nis discussed in the paper [1]. A heuristic based on threshold policy is\ndiscussed in the same paper without giving a way to find the threshold. In this\npaper, we suggested a rule for setting the threshold, given the parameters of\nthe system. We also point out that our results remain valid in a slightly\ndifferent mobility model; this model is a first step towards an `open' network\nin which existing relay nodes can leave and/or new relay nodes can join the\nnetwork."

    "summary": "Routing algorithms for wireless sensor networks can be broadly divided into\ntwo classes - proactive and reactive. Proactive routing is suitable for a\nnetwork with a fixed topology. On the other hand, reactive routing is more\nsuitable for a set of mobile nodes where routes are created on demand and there\nis not much time to evaluate the worthiness of a route, the prime concern being\nreachability due to constantly changing node positions. Sensor networks route\nevents of interest from source(s) to destination(s) where appropriate actions\ncould be taken. However, with mobile sensor nodes, it is not only important to\nknow the events but the location of the nodes generating the events. Most\nsensor nodes are not equipped with expensive GPS or accurate RSSI computation\nhardware to aid localization. Keeping these in view, we propose a modified\nreactive routing algorithm, with added support for localization, to localize\nmobile sensor nodes on the basis of information received from fixed sensor\nnodes during mutual exchange of routing control packets. The accuracy of\nlocalization depends on the ratio of the number of fixed nodes to the number of\nmobile nodes and the topology of the fixed nodes. A typical application\nscenario would be a mix of mobile nodes and fixed nodes, where fixed nodes know\ntheir absolute location and the location of mobile nodes is derived from the\nfixed nodes, in step with the reactive routing protocol in action. The modified\nalgorithm would be suitable for deployments where the approximate position of a\nmobile node (i.e. the event location) is required but there is no external\nsupport infrastructure available for localization."

In this\nscenario, a helpful approach is to reduce coverage redundancy and therefore the\nenergy expenditure due to coverage. We introduce the first algorithm which\nreduces coverage redundancy by means of Sensor Activation and sensing Radius\nAdaptation (SARA)in a general applicative scenario with two classes of devices:\nsensors that can adapt their sensing range (adjustable sensors) and sensors\nthat cannot (fixed sensors). In particular, SARA activates only a subset of all\nthe available sensors and reduces the sensing range of the adjustable sensors\nthat have been activated. In doing so, SARA also takes possible heterogeneous\ncoverage capabilities of sensors belonging to the same class into account. It\nspecifically addresses device heterogeneity by modeling the coverage problem in\nthe Laguerre geometry through Voronoi-Laguerre diagrams.\n  SARA executes quickly and is guaranteed to terminate. It provides a\nconfiguration of the active set of sensors that lifetime and coverage\nrequirements of demanding WSN applications, not met by current solutions.\n  By means of extensive simulations we show that SARA achieves a network\nlifetime that is significantly superior to that obtained by previous algorithms\nin all the considered scenarios."

    "summary": "This paper introduces the security and trust concepts in wireless sensor\nnetworks and explains the difference between them, stating that even though\nboth terms are used interchangeably when defining a secure system, they are not\nthe same. The difference between reputation and trust is also explained,\nhighlighting that reputation partially affects trust. A survey of trust and\nreputation systems in various domains is conducted, with more details given to\nmodels in ad-hoc and sensor networks as they are closely related to each other\nand to our research interests. The methodologies used to model trust and their\nreferences are presented. The factors affecting trust updating are summarised\nand some examples of the systems in which these factors have been implemented\nare given. The survey states that, even though researchers have started to\nexplore the issue of trust in wireless sensor networks, they are still\nexamining the trust associated with routing messages between nodes (binary\nevents). However, wireless sensor networks are mainly deployed to monitor\nevents and report data, both continuous and discrete. This leads to the\ndevelopment of new trust models addressing the continuous data issue and also\nto combine the data trust and the communication trust to infer the total trust."

    "summary": "The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server overload management has\nattracted interest since SIP is being widely deployed in the Next Generation\nNetworks (NGN) as a core signaling protocol. Yet all existing SIP overload\ncontrol work is focused on SIP-over-UDP, despite the fact that TCP is\nincreasingly seen as the more viable choice of SIP transport. This paper\nanswers the following questions: is the existing TCP flow control capable of\nhandling the SIP overload problem? If not, why and how can we make it work? We\nprovide a comprehensive explanation of the default SIP-over-TCP overload\nbehavior through server instrumentation. We also propose and implement novel\nbut simple overload control algorithms without any kernel or protocol level\nmodification. Experimental evaluation shows that with our mechanism the\noverload performance improves from its original zero throughput to nearly full\ncapacity. Our work leads to the important general insight that the traditional\nnotion of TCP flow control alone is incapable of managing overload for\ntime-critical session-based applications, which would be applicable not only to\nSIP, but also to a wide range of other common applications such as database\nservers."

This complicates the Minimum-Energy Multicasting (MEM) problem,\nwhich has been primarily studied in always-active wireless ad-hoc networks. In\nthis paper, we study the duty-cycle-aware MEM problem in wireless sensor\nnetworks, and we present a formulation of the Minimum-Energy Multicast Tree\nConstruction and Scheduling (MEMTCS) problem. We prove that the MEMTCS problem\nis NP-hard, and it is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with a\nperformance ratio of $(1-o(1))\\ln\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum node\ndegree in a network. We propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for\nthe MEMTCS problem with a performance ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(H(\\Delta+1))$,\nwhere $H(\\cdot)$ is the harmonic number. We also provide a distributed\nimplementation of our algorithm.

    "summary": "Research in location determination for GSM phones has gained interest\nrecently as it enables a wide set of location based services. RSSI-based\ntechniques have been the preferred method for GSM localization on the handset\nas RSSI information is available in all cell phones. Although the GSM standard\nallows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven\ncell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API\nsupport, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In\naddition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small\nand therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very\nlimited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone\nlocation with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell\ntower. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model based solution that\nleverages the signal strength history from only the associated cell tower to\nachieve accurate GSM localization. We discuss the challenges of implementing\nour system and present the details of our system and how it addresses the\nchallenges. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented it on Androidbased\nphones. Results for two different testbeds, representing urban and rural\nenvironments, show that our system provides at least 156% enhancement in median\nerror in rural areas and at least 68% enhancement in median error in urban\nareas compared to current RSSI-based GSM localization systems"

These issues, usually referred to as \"green\nnetworking\", relate to embedding energy-awareness in the design, in the devices\nand in the protocols of networks. In this work, we first formulate a more\nprecise definition of the \"green\" attribute. We furthermore identify a few\nparadigms that are the key enablers of energy-aware networking research. We\nthen overview the current state of the art and provide a taxonomy of the\nrelevant work, with a special focus on wired networking. At a high level, we\nidentify four branches of green networking research that stem from different\nobservations on the root causes of energy waste, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate,\n(ii) Interface proxying, (iii) Energy-aware infrastructures and (iv)\nEnergy-aware applications. In this work, we do not only explore specific\nproposals pertaining to each of the above branches, but also offer a\nperspective for research."

    "summary": "Rate adaptation plays a key role in determining the performance of wireless\nLANs. In this paper, we introduce a semi-Markovian framework to analyze the\nperformance of two of the most popular rate adaptation algorithms used in\nwireless LANs, namely Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF) and Adaptive Automatic Rate\nFallback (AARF). Given our modeling assumptions, the analysis is exact and\nprovides closed form expressions for the achievable throughput of ARF and AARF.\nWe illustrate the benefit of our analysis by numerically comparing the\nthroughput performance of ARF and AARF in two different channel regimes. The\nresults show that neither of these algorithms consistently outperforms the\nother. We thus propose and analyze a new variant to AARF, called Persistent\nAARF (or PAARF), and show that it achieves a good compromise between the two\nalgorithms, often performing close to the best algorithm in each of the studied\nregimes. The numerical results also shed light into the impact of MAC overhead\non the performance of the three algorithms. In particular, they show that the\nmore conservative strategies AARF and PAARF scale better as the bit rate\nincreases."

    "summary": "Contemporary personal computing devices are increasingly required to be\nportable and mobile enabling user's wireless access, to wired network\ninfrastructures and services. This approach to mobile computing and\ncommunication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure\nis available. There are many situations where these requirements are not\nfulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and\nmilitary conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile\ndevices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a\nMobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired\nnetworks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the\nwireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of\ncentral administration security issues are different from conventional\nnetworks. For the purposes of this article we have used the \"WMN test-bed\" to\nenable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven\nway of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are\nnot as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is\ndetrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic\napproaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to\nprovide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of\nperformance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing\nschemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of\nalgorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 and AES\nrespectively. Using this combination over their counterparts will lead to a\nconsiderable reduction in processing time and delay on the network, creating an\nefficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource constraints and\nsecurity requirements."

    "summary": "BitTorrent has recently introduced LEDBAT, a novel application-layer\ncongestion control protocol for data exchange. The protocol design starts from\nthe assumption that network bottlenecks are at the access of the network, and\nthat thus user traffic competes creating self-inducing congestion. To relieve\nfrom this phenomenon, LEDBAT is designed to quickly infer that self-induced\ncongestion is approaching (by detecting relative changes of the one-way delay\nin the transmission path), and to react by reducing the sending rate prior that\ncongestion occurs. Prior work has however shown LEDBAT to be affected by a\nlatecomer advantage, where newly arriving connections can starve already\nexisting flows. In this work, we propose modifications to the congestion window\nupdate mechanism of the LEDBAT protocol that aim at solving this issue,\nguaranteeing thus intra-protocol fairness and efficiency. Closed-form\nexpressions for the stationary throughput and queue occupancy are provided via\na fluid model, whose accuracy is confirmed by means of ns2 packet level\nsimulations. Our results show that the proposed change can effective solve the\nlatecomer issue, without affecting the other original LEDBAT goals at the same\ntime."

Misbehavior is challenged by bandwidth and energy efficient\nmedium access control and fair share of throughput. Node misbehavior plays an\nimportant role in MANET. In this survey, few of the contention window\nmisbehavior is reviewed and compared. The contention window cheating either\nminimizes the active communication of the network or reduces bandwidth\nutilization of a particular node. The classification presented is in no case\nunique but summarizes the chief characteristics of many published proposals for\ncontention window cheating. After getting insight into the different contention\nwindow misbehavior, few of the enhancements that can be done to improve the\nexisting contention window are suggested.

To trade off the revenue against the\nimplementational complexity, we further study the partial price differentiation\nscheme, and design a polynomial-time algorithm that can compute the optimal\npartial differentiation prices. We also consider the incomplete information\ncase where the service provider does not know which group each user belongs to.\nWe show that it is still possible to realize price differentiation under this\nscenario, and provide the sufficient and necessary condition under which an\nincentive compatible differentiation scheme can achieve the same revenue as\nunder complete information."

As MAC layer\naffects the link performance and consequently the route quality, the metric\ntherefore, tackles the issue by achieving twofold MAC-awareness. Firstly,\ninterference is calculated using cross-layered approach by sending probes to\nMAC layer. Secondly, the nominal bit rate information is provided to all nodes\nin the same contention domain by considering the bandwidth sharing mechanism of\n802.11. Like ETX, our metric also calculates link delivery ratios that directly\naffect throughput and selects those routes that bypass dense regions in the\nnetwork. Simulation results by NS-2 show that IBETX gives 19% higher throughput\nthan ETX and 10% higher than Expected Throughput (ETP). Our metric also\nsucceeds to reduce average end-to-end delay up to 16% less than Expected Link\nPerformance (ELP) and 24% less than ETX."

    "summary": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) locality has recently raised a lot of interest in the\ncommunity. Indeed, whereas P2P content distribution enables financial savings\nfor the content providers, it dramatically increases the traffic on inter-ISP\nlinks. To solve this issue, the idea to keep a fraction of the P2P traffic\nlocal to each ISP was introduced a few years ago. Since then, P2P solutions\nexploiting locality have been introduced. However, several fundamental issues\non locality still need to be explored. In particular, how far can we push\nlocality, and what is, at the scale of the Internet, the reduction of traffic\nthat can be achieved with locality? In this paper, we perform extensive\nexperiments on a controlled environment with up to 10,000 BitTorrent clients to\nevaluate the impact of high locality on inter-ISP links traffic and peers\ndownload completion time. We introduce two simple mechanisms that make high\nlocality possible in challenging scenarios and we show that we save up to\nseveral orders of magnitude inter-ISP traffic compared to traditional locality\nwithout adversely impacting peers download completion time. In addition, we\ncrawled 214,443 torrents representing 6,113,224 unique peers spread among 9,605\nASes. We show that whereas the torrents we crawled generated 11.6 petabytes of\ninter-ISP traffic, our locality policy implemented for all torrents could have\nreduced the global inter-ISP traffic by up to 40%."

    "summary": "With the increasing demands for new data and real-time services, wireless\nnetworks should support calls with different traffic characteristics and\ndifferent Quality of Service (QoS)guarantees. In addition, various wireless\ntechnologies and networks exist currently that can satisfy different needs and\nrequirements of mobile users. Since these different wireless networks act as\ncomplementary to each other in terms of their capabilities and suitability for\ndifferent applications, integration of these networks will enable the mobile\nusers to be always connected to the best available access network depending on\ntheir requirements. This integration of heterogeneous networks will, however,\nlead to heterogeneities in access technologies and network protocols. To meet\nthe requirements of mobile users under this heterogeneous environment, a common\ninfrastructure to interconnect multiple access networks will be needed. In this\nchapter, the design issues of a number of mobility management schemes have been\npresented. Each of these schemes utilizes IP-based technologies to enable\nefficient roaming in heterogeneous network. Efficient handoff mechanisms are\nessential for ensuring seamless connectivity and uninterrupted service\ndelivery. A number of handoff schemes in a heterogeneous networking environment\nare also presented in this chapter."

Previous works study the availability of hosts mostly\nby using either active pinging or by studying access to a mail service, both\napproaches suffer from inherent inaccuracies. We take a different approach by\nmeasuring the IP addresses periodically reported by a uniquely identified group\nof the hosts running the DIMES agent. This fresh approach provides a chance to\nmeasure the true availability of end-hosts and the dynamics of their assigned\nroutable IP addresses. Using a two month study of 1804 hosts, we find that over\n60% of the hosts have a fixed IP address and 90% median availability, while\nsome of the remaining hosts have more than 30 different IPs. For those that\nhave periodically changing IP addresses, we find that the median average period\nper AS is roughly 24 hours, with a strong relation between the offline time and\nthe probability of altering IP address."

    "summary": "The use of RFID tag which identifies a thing and an object will be expanded\nwith progress of ubiquitous society, and it is necessary to study how to\nconstruct RFID network system as a social infrastructure like the Internet.\nFirst, this paper proposes the virtualization method of RFID tag network system\nto enable the same physical RFID network system to be used by multiple\ndifferent service systems. The system virtualization not only reduces the\nsystem cost but also can dramatically reduce the installation space of physical\nreaders and the operation cost. It is proposed that all equipments in the RFID\nnetwork system except RFID tag could be shared with the conventional virtual\ntechnologies. Then, this paper proposes the conditional tag ID processing and\nthe efficient tag ID transmission method which can greatly reduce the\nprocessing time and processing load in RFID tag Infrastructure network The\nconditional tag ID processing allows that tag ID is valid only at a certain\ntime zone of day or in a certain area. The efficient tag ID transmission method\nuses the virtual network address of the service center as a part of the ID of\nan RF tag, which allows the direct ID forwarding to the service center."

IM accuracy is not satisfactory since neither MMRs nor DT records\ncontain complete information on interference and traffic distribution. In this\npaper, two IM generation algorithms based on source data fusion are proposed.\nData fusion in one algorithm is to reinforce MMRs data, using the\nfrequency-domain information of DT data from the same region.

However, BSNs are usually vulnerable to channel\nimpairments due to body fading effect and RF interference, which may\npotentially cause data transmission to be unreliable. In this paper, an\nadaptive and flexible fault-tolerant communication scheme for BSNs, namely\nAFTCS, is proposed. AFTCS adopts a channel bandwidth reservation strategy to\nprovide reliable data transmission when channel impairments occur. In order to\nfulfill the reliability requirements of critical sensors, fault-tolerant\npriority and queue are employed to adaptively adjust the channel bandwidth\nallocation. Simulation results show that AFTCS can alleviate the effect of\nchannel impairments, while yielding lower packet loss rate and latency for\ncritical sensors at runtime."

    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks are often modeled in terms of a dense deployment of\nsmart sensor nodes in a two-dimensional region. Give a node deployment, the\n\\emph{critical geometric graph (CGG)} over these locations (i.e., the connected\n\\emph{geometric graph (GG)} with the smallest radius) is a useful structure\nsince it provides the most accurate proportionality between hop-count and\nEuclidean distance. Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as\nwell as minimum distance packet forwarding. It is also known to be\nasymptotically optimal for network transport capacity and power efficiency. In\nthis context, we propose DISCRIT, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for\nobtaining an approximation of the CGG on the node locations. The algorithm does\nnot require the knowledge of node locations or internode distances, nor does it\nrequire pair-wise RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements to be\nmade. Instead, the algorithm makes use of successful Hello receipt counts\n(obtained during a Hello-protocol-based neighbour discovery process) as edge\nweights, along with a simple distributed min-max computation algorithm. In this\npaper, we first provide the theory for justifying the use of the above edge\nweights. Then we provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate the\nefficacy of DISCRIT in obtaining an approximation of the CGG. Finally, we show\nhow the CGG obtained from DISCRIT performs when used in certain network\nself-organisation algorithms."

In this paper, we study more practical CSMA-based scheduling\nalgorithms with collisions. First, we provide a Markov chain model and give an\nexplicit throughput formula which takes into account the cost of collisions and\noverhead. The formula has a simple form since the Markov chain is \"almost\"\ntime-reversible. Second, we propose transmission-length control algorithms to\napproach throughput optimality in this case. Sufficient conditions are given to\nensure the convergence and stability of the proposed algorithms.

Simulation results indicate that the number of zone-disjoint paths per\nmulti-path set can be at most 2, which is far lower than the number of node and\nlink-disjoint paths available per multi-path set. Also, the time between\nzone-disjoint multi-path discoveries would be far lower than the time between\nnode and link-disjoint multi-path route discoveries and can be at most 45% more\nthan the time between single minimum-hop path route discoveries. However, there\nis no appreciable difference in the average hop counts per zone-disjoint,\nnode-disjoint and link-disjoint multi-path sets and it can be only at most 15%\nmore than the average minimum hop count determined using single-path routing.\nWe also observe that even though the number of link-disjoint paths per\nmulti-path set can be as large as 35-78% more than the number of node-disjoint\npaths per multi-path set, the time between two successive link-disjoint\nmulti-path discoveries can be at most 15-25% more than the time between two\nsuccessive node-disjoint multi-path discoveries, without any significant\ndifference in the hop count per multi-path set."

These sensor\nnodes are mainly in large numbers and are densely deployed either inside the\nphenomenon or very close to it. They can be used for various application areas\n(e.g. health, military, home). Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor\nnetworks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. Therefore,\nit is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate\nmeasures are taken to sustain network operation.

In this paper we extend the\ncellular approach and propose a new fault management mechanism to deal with\nfault detection and recovery. We propose a hierarchical structure to properly\ndistribute fault management tasks among sensor nodes by introducing more\n'self-managing' functions. The proposed failure detection and recovery\nalgorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be\nmore energy efficient."

The\nnodes' mobility in MWSN poses a challenge to design an energy efficient routing\nprotocol. Clustering helps to achieve energy efficiency by reducing the\norganization complexity overhead of the network which is proportional to the\nnumber of nodes in the network. This paper proposes a novel hybrid multipath\nrouting algorithm with an efficient clustering technique. A node is selected as\ncluster head if it has high surplus energy, better transmission range and least\nmobility. The Energy Aware (EA) selection mechanism and the Maximal Nodal\nSurplus Energy estimation technique incorporated in this algorithm improves the\nenergy performance during routing.

    "summary": "We present a multi-channel P2P Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using\n\"plug-and-play\" helpers. Helpers are heterogenous \"micro-servers\" with limited\nstorage, bandwidth and number of users they can serve simultaneously. Our\nproposed system has the following salient features: (1) it minimizes the server\nload; (2) it is distributed, and requires little or no maintenance overhead and\nwhich can easily adapt to system dynamics; and (3) it is adaptable to varying\nsupply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video\npopularity. Our proposed solution jointly optimizes over helper-user topology,\nvideo storage allocation and bandwidth allocation. The combinatorial nature of\nthe problem and the system demand for distributed algorithms makes the problem\nuniquely challenging. By utilizing Lagrangian decomposition and Markov chain\napproximation based arguments, we address this challenge by designing two\ndistributed algorithms running in tandem: a primal-dual storage and bandwidth\nallocation algorithm and a \"soft-worst-neighbor-choking\" topology-building\nalgorithm. Our scheme provably converges to a near-optimal solution, and is\neasy to implement in practice. Simulation results validate that the proposed\nscheme achieves minimum sever load under highly heterogeneous combinations of\nsupply and demand patterns, and is robust to system dynamics of user/helper\nchurn, user/helper asynchrony, and random delays in the network."

    "summary": "During the past few years, we have observed the emergence of new applications\nthat use multicast transmission. For a multicast routing algorithm to be\napplicable in optical networks, it must route data only to group members,\noptimize and maintain loop-free routes, and concentrate the routes on a subset\nof network links. For an all-optical switch to play the role of a branching\nrouter, it must be equipped with a light splitter. Light splitters are\nexpensive equipments and therefore it will be very expensive to implement\nsplitters on all optical switches. Optical light splitters are only implemented\non some optical switches. That limited availability of light splitters raises a\nnew problem when we want to implement multicast protocols in optical network\n(because usual multicast protocols make the assumption that all nodes have\nbranching capabilities). Another issue is the knowledge of the locations of\nlight splitters in the optical network. Nodes in the network should be able to\nidentify the locations of light splitters scattered in the optical network so\nit can construct multicast trees. These problems must be resolved by\nimplementing a multicast routing protocol that must take into consideration\nthat not all nodes can be branching node. As a result, a new signaling process\nmust be implemented so that light paths can be created, spanning from source to\nthe group members."

The key message in\nthis paper is that push message delivery on the World Wide Web is not scalable\nfor servers, intermediate network elements, and battery-operated mobile device\nclients. We present a measurement analysis of a commercially deployed WWW push\nemail service to highlight some of these issues. Next, we suggest content-based\noptimization to reduce the always-on connection requirement of push messaging.\nOur idea is based on exploiting the periodic nature of human-to-human\nmessaging. We show how machine learning can accurately model the times of a day\nor week when messages are least likely to arrive; and turn off always-on\nconnections these times. We apply our approach to a real email data set and our\nexperiments demonstrate that the number of hours of active always-on\nconnections can be cut by half while still achieving real-time message delivery\nfor up to 90% of all messages."

We propose an adaptive\nretransmission limits algorithm for IEEE 802.11 MAC to reduce the false link\nfailures and predict the node mobility. We implemented cross layer interaction\nbetween physical and MAC layers. The MAC layer utilizes the physical layer\ninformation for differentiating false link failure from true link failure. The\nMAC layer adaptively selects a retransmission limit (short and long) based on\nthe neighbour signal strength and sender node speed information from the\nphysical layer. The proposed approach tracks the signal strength of each node\nin network and, while transmitting to a neighbour node, if it's received signal\nstrength is high and is received recently then Adaptive MAC persists in its\nretransmission attempts. As there is high probability that neighbour node is\nstill in transmission range and may be not responding due to some problems\nother then mobility. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of MANET and\nshow that how our Adaptive MAC greatly improves it. The simulation is done\nusing Network Simulator NS-2."

In this paper, a\nslotted transmission scheme is suggested, in which usable timeslots are found\nout by physically sensing the media.

    "summary": "Transmit power control in wireless networks has long been recognized as an\neffective mechanism to mitigate co-channel interference. Due to the highly\nnon-convex nature, optimal power control is known to be difficult to achieve if\na system utility is to be maximized. To date, there does not yet exist a\ndistributed power control algorithm that maximizes any form of system utility,\ndespite the importance of distributed implementation for the wireless\ninfrastructureless networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks. This paper\nfills this gap by developing a Gibbs Sampling based Asynchronous distributed\npower control algorithm (referred to as GLAD). The proposed algorithm quickly\nconverges to the global optimal solution regardless of the concavity,\ncontinuity, differentiability and monotonicity of the utility function. Same as\nother existing distributed power control algorithms, GLAD requires extensive\nmessage passing among all users in the network, which leads to high signaling\noverhead and high processing complexity. To address this issue, this paper\nfurther proposes a variant of the GLAD algorithm, referred to as I-GLAD, where\nthe prefix \"I\" stands for infrequent message passing. The convergence of I-GLAD\ncan be proved regardless of the reduction in the message passing rate. To\nfurther reduce the processing complexity at each transmitter, we develop an\nenhanced version of I-GLAD, referred to as NI-GLAD, where only the control\nmessages from the neighboring links are processed. Our simulation results show\nthat I-GLAD approximately converges to the global optimal solution regardless\nof the type of the system utility function. Meanwhile, the optimality of the\nsolution obtained by NI-GLAD depends on the selection of the neighborhood size."

    "summary": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are highly distributed networks consisting of\na large number of tiny, low-cost, light-weight wireless nodes deployed to\nmonitor an environment or a system. Each node in a WSN consists of three\nsubsystems: the sensor subsystem which senses the environment, the processing\nsubsystem which performs local computations on the sensed data, and the\ncommunication subsystem which is responsible for message exchange with\nneighboring sensor nodes. While an individual sensor node has limited sensing\nregion, processing power, and energy, networking a large number of sensor nodes\ngive rise to a robust, reliable, and accurate sensor network covering a wide\nregion. Thus, routing in WSNs is a very important issue. This paper presents a\nquery-based routing protocol for a WSN that provides different levels of\nQuality of Service (QoS): energy-efficiency, reliability, low latency and\nfault-tolerance-under different application scenarios. The algorithm has low\ncomputational complexity but can dynamically guarantee different QoS support\ndepending on the requirement of the applications. The novelty of the proposed\nalgorithm is its ability to provide multiple QoS support without\nreconfiguration and redeployment of the sensor nodes. The algorithm is\nimplemented in network simulator ns-2 and its performance has been evaluated.\nThe results show that the algorithm is more efficient than some of the\ncurrently existing routing algorithms for WSNs."

As sensors move around,\ninitially uncovered locations are likely to be covered at a later time. A\nlarger area is covered as time continues, and intruders that might never be\ndetected in a stationary sensor network can now be detected by moving sensors.\nHowever, this improvement in coverage is achieved at the cost that a location\nis covered only part of the time, alternating between covered and not covered.\nWe characterize area coverage at specific time instants and during time\nintervals, as well as the time durations that a location is covered and\nuncovered. We further characterize the time it takes to detect a randomly\nlocated intruder. For mobile intruders, we take a game theoretic approach and\nderive optimal mobility strategies for both sensors and intruders. Our results\nshow that sensor mobility brings about unique dynamic coverage properties not\npresent in a stationary sensor network, and that mobility can be exploited to\ncompensate for the lack of sensors to improve coverage."

    "summary": "When data productions and consumptions are heavily unbalanced and when the\norigins of data queries are spatially and temporally distributed, the so called\nin-network data storage paradigm supersedes the conventional data collection\nparadigm in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we first introduce\ngeometric quorum systems (along with their metrics) to incarnate the idea of\nin-network data storage. These quorum systems are \"geometric\" because curves\n(rather than discrete node sets) are used to form quorums. We then propose\nGeoQuorum as a new quorum system, for which the quorum forming curves are\nparameterized. Though our proposal stems from the existing work on using curves\nto guide data replication and retrieval in dense WSNs, we significantly expand\nthis design methodology, by endowing GeoQuorum with a great flexibility to\nfine-tune itself towards different application requirements. In particular, the\ntunability allows GeoQuorum to substantially improve the load balancing\nperformance and to remain competitive in energy efficiency. Both our analysis\nand simulations confirm the performance enhancement brought by GeoQuorum."

    "summary": "Objective-The main purpose of this paper is to construct a data accuracy\nmodel for the maximal set of sensor nodes that sense a point event and forms a\ncluster with fully connected network between them. We determine the minimal set\nof sensor nodes that are sufficient to give approximately the same data\naccuracy achieve by the maximal set of sensor nodes. Design\napproach/Procedure-L set of sensor nodes are randomly deployed over a region Z.\nSince a point event S has occurred in the region Z, M maximal set of sensor\nnodes wake up and start sensing the point event. The set of M sensor nodes\nforms a cluster with fully connected network and remaining set of sensor nodes\ncontinue to be in sleep mode. One sensor node is elected randomly as a cluster\nhead (CH) node which can estimate the data accuracy for the cluster before data\naggregation and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings - Since we\nsimulate the data accuracy for the cluster (M set of sensor nodes) at CH node,\nthere exist P minimal set of sensor nodes which give approximately the same\ndata accuracy level achieve by M set of sensor nodes .Moreover we find that as\nthe distance from the point event to the number of sensor nodes increases, the\ndata accuracy also get decreases.

    "summary": "The increasing popularity of web-based applications has led to several\ncritical services being provided over the Internet. This has made it imperative\nto monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from\ndepleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate\nusers. This paper has presented a mechanism for protecting a web-server against\na distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Incoming traffic to the server\nis continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is\nimmediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical\nanalysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing\nframework. While the detection process is on, the sessions from the legitimate\nsources are not disrupted and the load on the server is restored to the normal\nlevel by blocking the traffic from the attacking sources. To cater to different\nscenarios, the detection algorithm has various modules with varying level of\ncomputational and memory overheads for their execution. While the approximate\nmodules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower\ndetection accuracy. The accurate modules involve complex detection logic and\nhence involve more overhead for their execution, but they have very high\ndetection accuracy. Simulations carried out on the proposed mechanism have\nproduced results that demonstrate effectiveness of the scheme."

    "summary": "Access networks, in particular, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) equipment, are\na significant source of energy consumption for wireline operators. Replacing\nlarge monolithic DSLAMs with smaller remote DSLAM units closer to customers can\nreduce the energy consumption as well as increase the reach of the access\nnetwork. This paper attempts to formalize the design and optimization of the\n\"last mile\" wireline access network with energy as one of the costs to be\nminimized. In particular, the placement of remote DSLAM units needs to be\noptimized. We propose solutions for two scenarios. For the scenario where an\nexisting all-copper network from the central office to the customers is to be\ntransformed into a fiber-copper network with remote DSLAM units, we present\noptimal polynomial-time solutions. In the green-field scenario, both the access\nnetwork layout and the placement of remote DSLAM units must be determined. We\nshow that this problem is NP-complete. We present an optimal ILP formulation\nand also design an efficient heuristic-based approach to build a\npower-and-cost-optimized access network. Our heuristic-based approach yields\nresults that are very close to optimal. We show how the power consumption of\nthe access network can be reduced by carefully laying the access network and\nintroducing remote DSLAM units."

    "summary": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly emerging as an important new area\nin wireless and mobile computing research. Applications of WSNs are numerous\nand growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office\nto outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical\nbattleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of\nWSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy\nsoldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks\noffer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders\nvia a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and\nlivelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data\nobtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to\nprevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and\nfrom forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data\nintegrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify\nforged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004).\nThe focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently\nexisting routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited\ncapabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network,\nbut do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols\nhave not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to\nanalyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of\ninsecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible\ninsider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy\nand long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing\nprotocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task."

We introduce methods and metrics for performing location\ndistinction in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless networks. Using\nMIMO channel measurements from two different testbeds, we evaluate the\nperformance of temporal signature-based location distinction with varying\nsystem parameters, and show that it can be applied to MIMO channels with\nfavorable results. In particular, a 2x2 MIMO channel with a bandwidth of 80 MHz\nallows a 64-fold reduction in miss rate over the SISO channel for a fixed false\nalarm rate, achieving as small as 4 x 10^-4 probability of false alarm for a\n2.4 x 10^-4 probability of missed detection. The very high reliability of MIMO\nlocation distinction enables location distinction systems to detect the change\nin position of a transmitter even when using a single receiver."

    "summary": "Our work is motivated by geographical forwarding of sporadic alarm packets to\na base station in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the nodes are\nsleep-wake cycling periodically and asynchronously. When a node (referred to as\nthe source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an\nupstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred\nto as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward\n(e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the\nsource is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the\nreward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant,\nwhen a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the\npacket or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to\nminimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on\nthe average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work\ncan be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem. We formulate the\nrelay selection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process\n(POMDP), where the unknown state is the number of relays. We begin by\nconsidering the case where the source knows the number of relays. For the\ngeneral case, where the source only knows a pmf on the number of relays, it has\nto maintain a posterior pmf on the number of relays and forward the packet iff\nthe pmf is in an optimum stopping set. We show that the optimum stopping set is\nconvex and obtain inner and outer bounds to this set. The computational\ncomplexity of the above policies motivates us to formulate an alternative\nsimplified model, the optimal policy for which is a simple threshold rule. We\nprovide simulation results to compare the performance of the various one-hop\nand end-to-end forwarding policies."

    "summary": "In operational networks, nodes are connected via multiple links for load\nsharing and redundancy. This is done to make sure that a failure of a link does\nnot disconnect or isolate some parts of the network. However, link failures\nhave an effect on routing, as the routers find alternate paths for the traffic\noriginally flowing through the link which has failed. This effect is severe in\ncase of failure of a critical link in the network, such as backbone links or\nthe links carrying higher traffic loads. When routing is done using the Open\nShortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, the original weight selection for\nthe normal state topology may not be as efficient for the failure state. In\nthis paper, we investigate the single link failure issue with an objective to\nfind a weight setting which results in efficient routing in normal and failure\nstates. We engineer Tabu Search Iterative heuristic using two different\nimplementation strategies to solve the OSPF weight setting problem for link\nfailure scenarios. We evaluate these heuristics and show through experimental\nresults that both heuristics efficiently handle weight setting for the failure\nstate. A comparison of both strategies is also presented."

Our approach can be employed both as a comparison tool, as well as a\nmeasurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation\ninfluence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance.\n  We base our approach on a framework that allows easy swarm creation and\ncontrol for different BitTorrent clients.

    "summary": "Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome the ossification\nof today's Internet as it facilitates innovation also in the network core and\nas it promises a more efficient use of the given resources and infrastructure.\nVirtual networks (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network:\nmultiple VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on\ncompletely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the main\nchallenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission control and\nembedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks (e.g., for a video\nconference) can be hard to predict, and once the request is accepted, the\nspecification / QoS guarantees must be ensured throughout the VNet's lifetime.\nThis requires an admission control algorithm which only selects high-benefit\nVNets in times of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes\nthe VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be embedded\nas well is maximized.\n  This article describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet embedding\nproblem which does not rely on any knowledge of the future VNet requests but\nwhose performance is competitive to an optimal offline algorithm that has\ncomplete knowledge of the request sequence in advance: the so-called\ncompetitive ratio is, loosely speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the\nresources. Our algorithm is generic in the sense that it supports multiple\ntraffic models, multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform\nbenefits and durations of VNet requests."

    "summary": "Privacy-preserving techniques for distributed computation have been proposed\nrecently as a promising framework in collaborative inter-domain network\nmonitoring. Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems,\ne.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based\non Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a\ncomputation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is\npossible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the\nintermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs\nand/or provide secret outputs. However, they are computationally expensive and\ndo not scale well in the number of players and/or in the rate of computation\ntasks. In this paper we advocate the use of \"elementary\" (as opposite to\n\"complete\") Secure Multiparty Computation (E-SMC) procedures for traffic\nmonitoring. E-SMC supports only simple computations with private input and\npublic output, i.e., it can not handle secret input nor secret (intermediate)\noutput. Such a simplification brings a dramatic reduction in complexity and\nenables massive-scale implementation with acceptable delay and overhead.\nNotwithstanding its simplicity, we claim that an E-SMC scheme is sufficient to\nperform a great variety of computation tasks of practical relevance to\ncollaborative network monitoring, including, e.g., anonymous publishing and set\noperations. This is achieved by combining a E-SMC scheme with data structures\nlike Bloom Filters and bitmap strings."

Each channel is characterized by an availability probability unknown to\nthe SUs. We apply evolutionary game theory to model the spectrum access problem\nand develop distributed spectrum access policies based on imitation, a behavior\nrule widely applied in human societies consisting of imitating successful\nbehavior. We first develop two imitation-based spectrum access policies based\non the basic Proportional Imitation (PI) rule and the more advanced Double\nImitation (DI) rule given that a SU can imitate any other SUs. We then adapt\nthe proposed policies to a more practical scenario where a SU can only imitate\nthe other SUs operating on the same channel. A systematic theoretical analysis\nis presented for both scenarios on the induced imitation dynamics and the\nconvergence properties of the proposed policies to an imitation-stable\nequilibrium, which is also the $\\epsilon$-optimum of the system.

    "summary": "A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a collection of low-power and\nlightweight wireless sensor nodes that are used to monitor the human body\nfunctions and the surrounding environment. It supports a number of innovative\nand interesting applications, including ubiquitous healthcare and Consumer\nElectronics (CE) applications. Since WBAN nodes are used to collect sensitive\n(life-critical) information and may operate in hostile environments, they\nrequire strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the\nsystem. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks in WBAN at Physical, Medium Access Control\n(MAC), Network, and Transport layers. Then we discuss the IEEE 802.15.4\nsecurity framework and identify the security vulnerabilities and major attacks\nin the context of WBAN. Different types of attacks on the Contention Access\nPeriod (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP) parts of the superframe are\nanalyzed and discussed. It is observed that a smart attacker can successfully\ncorrupt an increasing number of GTS slots in the CFP period and can\nconsiderably affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in WBAN (since most of the\ndata is carried in CFP period). As we increase the number of smart attackers\nthe corrupted GTS slots are eventually increased, which prevents the legitimate\nnodes to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. This means that the direct\nadaptation of IEEE 802.15.4 security framework for WBAN is not totally secure\nfor certain WBAN applications. New solutions are required to integrate high\nlevel security in WBAN."

    "summary": "The growth of the World Wide Web has emphasized the need for improvement in\nuser latency. One of the techniques that are used for improving user latency is\nCaching and another is Web Prefetching. Approaches that bank solely on caching\noffer limited performance improvement because it is difficult for caching to\nhandle the large number of increasingly diverse files. Studies have been\nconducted on prefetching models based on decision trees, Markov chains, and\npath analysis. However, the increased uses of dynamic pages, frequent changes\nin site structure and user access patterns have limited the efficacy of these\nstatic techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to cluster\nrelated pages into different categories based on the access patterns.\nAdditionally we use page ranking to build up our prediction model at the\ninitial stages when users haven't already started sending requests. This way we\nhave tried to overcome the problems of maintaining huge databases which is\nneeded in case of log based techniques."

    "summary": "Current handoffs are not designed to achieve multiple desirable features\nsimultaneously. This weakness has resulted in handoff schemes that are seamless\nbut not adaptive, or adaptive but not secure, or secure but not autonomous, or\nautonomous but not correct, etc. To face this limitation, we initiated a\nresearch project to develop a new kind of handoff system which attains multiple\npurposes simultaneously by using context information from the external and\ninternal handoff environment. We envision a cognitive handoff as a\nmultipurpose, multi-criteria, environment-aware, and policy-based handoff that\ntrades-off multiple objectives to reach its intended goals. This paper presents\na conceptual (soft) model of cognitive handoffs using a holistic approach. We\napplied the proposed model to identify cognitive handoff performance parameters\nand tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We argue that cognitive handoffs\nare the archetype of handoffs for the future Internet."

    "summary": "A challenging problem in multi-band multi-cell self-organized wireless\nsystems, such as multi-channel Wi-Fi networks, femto/pico cells in 3G/4G\ncellular networks, and more recent wireless networks over TV white spaces, is\nof distributed resource allocation. This involves four components: channel\nselection, client association, channel access, and client scheduling. In this\npaper, we present a unified framework for jointly addressing the four\ncomponents with the global system objective of maximizing the clients\nthroughput in a proportionally fair manner. Our formulation allows a natural\ndissociation of the problem into two sub-parts. We show that the first part,\ninvolving channel access and client scheduling, is convex and derive a\ndistributed adaptation procedure for achieving Pareto-optimal solution. For the\nsecond part, involving channel selection and client association, we develop a\nGibbs-sampler based approach for local adaptation to achieve the global\nobjective, as well as derive fast greedy algorithms from it that achieve good\nsolutions."

    "summary": "We consider the localization problem of multiple wideband sources in a\nmulti-path environment by coherently taking into account the attenuation\ncharacteristics and the time delays in the reception of the signal. Our\nproposed method leaves the space for unavailability of an accurate signal\nattenuation model in the environment by considering the model as an unknown\nfunction with reasonable prior assumptions about its functional space. Such\napproach is capable of enhancing the localization performance compared to only\nutilizing the signal attenuation information or the time delays. In this paper,\nthe localization problem is modeled as a cost function in terms of the source\nlocations, attenuation model parameters and the multi-path parameters. To\nglobally perform the minimization, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining the\ndifferential evolution algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.\nBesides the proposed combination of optimization schemes, supporting the\ntechnical details such as closed forms of cost function sensitivity matrices\nare provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is examined in\nseveral localization scenarios, taking into account the noise in the\nenvironment, the multi-path phenomenon and considering the sensors not being\nsynchronized."

    "summary": "Performance and reliability of content access in mobile networks is\nconditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the\nnetwork nodes. Location theory has been the traditional, centralized approach\nto study content replication: computing the number and placement of replicas in\na static network can be cast as a facility location problem. The endeavor of\nthis work is to design a practical solution to the above joint optimization\nproblem that is suitable for mobile wireless environments. We thus seek a\nreplication algorithm that is lightweight, distributed, and reactive to network\ndynamics. We devise a solution that lets nodes (i) share the burden of storing\nand providing content, so as to achieve load balancing, and (ii) autonomously\ndecide whether to replicate or drop the information, so as to adapt the content\navailability to dynamic demands and time-varying network topologies. We\nevaluate our mechanism through simulation, by exploring a wide range of\nsettings, including different node mobility models, content characteristics and\nsystem scales. Furthermore, we compare our mechanism to state-of-the-art\napproaches to content delivery in static and mobile networks. Results show that\nour mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely precise in\napproximating an optimal solution to content placement and replication; (ii)\nrobust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in accommodating various\ncontent access patterns. Moreover, our scheme outperforms alternative\napproaches to content dissemination both in terms of content access delay and\naccess congestion."

Relentless Congestion Control (RCC) is a modification of the AIMD\n(Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control which consists\nin decreasing the TCP congestion window by the number of lost segments instead\nof halving it. Despite some on-going discussions at the ICCRG IRTF-group, this\ncongestion control has, to the best of our knowledge, never been modeled. In\nthis paper, we provide an analytical model of this novel congestion control and\npropose an implementation of RCC for the commonly-used network simulator ns-2.\nWe also improve RCC with the addition of a loss retransmission detection scheme\n(based on SACK+) to prevent RTO caused by a loss of a retransmission and called\nthis new version RCC+. The proposed models describe both the original RCC\nalgorithm and RCC+ improvement and would allow to better assess the impact of\nthis new congestion control scheme over the network traffic."

Management of\nsource-destination traffic streams is flow-aware with the size of allocated\ntime slices being proportional to the number of active flows. This emulates a\nnetwork-wide, distributed fair queuing scheduler, bringing the well-known\nimplicit service differentiation and robustness advantages of this mechanism to\nthe metro area network. The paper presents a comprehensive performance\nevaluation based on analytical modelling supported by simulations. The proposed\nMAC is shown to have excellent performance in terms of both traffic capacity\nand packet latency."

This scenario includes the three pairs fairness\nproblem, and allows to study some fairness issues of the IEEE 802.11 medium\naccess mechanism. We show by simulation that interesting phenomena appear,\ndepending on the number n of pairs in the chain and of its parity. We also\npoint out a notable asymptotic behavior. We introduce a powerful modeling, by\nsimply considering the probability for a transmitter to send data while its\nneighbors are waiting. This model leads to a non-linear system of equations,\nwhich matches very well the simulations, and which allows to study both small\nand very large chains. We then analyze the fairness issue in the chain\nregarding some parameters, as well as the asymptotic behavior. By studying very\nlong chains, we notice good asymptotic fairness of the IEEE 802.11 medium\nsharing mechanism. As an application, we show how to increase the fairness in a\nchain of three pairs."

The consequences of this phenomenon\nhave direct impact on peer and system performance, such as high variability of\ndownload times, unfairness with respect to peer arrival order, bursty\ndepartures and content synchronization. Detailed packet-level simulations and\nprototype-based experiments on the Internet were performed to characterize this\nphenomenon. We also develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts the\nheterogeneous download rates of the homogeneous peers as a function of their\ncontent. Although this phenomenon is more prevalent in unpopular swarms (very\nfew peers), these by far represent the most common type of swarm in BT."

    "summary": "Providing proper economic incentives is essential for the success of dynamic\nspectrum sharing. Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve\nthis goal. In cooperative spectrum sharing, secondary users (SUs) relay\ntraffics for primary users (PUs), in exchange for dedicated transmission time\nfor the SUs' own communication needs. In this paper, we study the cooperative\nspectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' types (capturing\ntheir heterogeneity in relay channel gains and evaluations of power\nconsumptions) are private information and not known by PUs. Inspired by the\ncontract theory, we model the network as a labor market. The single PU is the\nemployer who offers a contract to the SUs. The contract consists of a set of\ncontract items representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i.e.,\nreward) and relaying power (i.e., contribution). The SUs are employees, and\neach of them selects the best contract item to maximize his payoff. We study\nthe optimal contract design for both weak and strong incomplete information\nscenarios. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible\ncontracts in both scenarios. In the weak incomplete information scenario, we\nfurther derive the optimal contract that achieves the same maximum PU's utility\nas in the complete information benchmark. In the strong incomplete information\nscenario, we propose a Decompose-and-Compare algorithm that achieves a\nclose-to-optimal contract. We future show that the PU's average utility loss\ndue to the suboptimal algorithm and the strong incomplete information are both\nrelatively small (less than 2% and 1:3%, respectively, in our numerical results\nwith two SU types)."

    "summary": "Random 1/2-disk routing in wireless ad-hoc networks is a localized geometric\nrouting scheme in which each node chooses the next relay randomly among the\nnodes within its transmission range and in the general direction of the\ndestination. We introduce a notion of convergence for geometric routing schemes\nthat not only considers the feasibility of packet delivery through possibly\nmulti-hop relaying, but also requires the packet delivery to occur in a finite\nnumber of hops. We derive sufficient conditions that ensure the asymptotic\n\\emph{convergence} of the random 1/2-disk routing scheme based on this\nconvergence notion, and by modeling the packet distance evolution to the\ndestination as a Markov process, we derive bounds on the expected number of\nhops that each packet traverses to reach its destination."

    "summary": "We propose distributed link reversal algorithms to circumvent communication\nvoids in geographic routing. We also solve the attendant problem of integer\noverflow in these algorithms. These are achieved in two steps. First, we derive\npartial and full link reversal algorithms that do not require one-hop neighbor\ninformation, and convert a destination-disoriented directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nto a destination-oriented DAG. We embed these algorithms in the framework of\nGafni and Bertsekas (\"Distributed algorithms for generating loop-free routes in\nnetworks with frequently changing topology\", 1981) in order to establish their\ntermination properties. We also analyze certain key properties exhibited by our\nneighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms, e.g., for any two neighbors, their\nt-states are always consecutive integers, and for any node, its t-state size is\nupper bounded by log(N). In the second step, we resolve the integer overflow\nproblem by analytically deriving one-bit full link reversal and two-bit partial\nlink reversal versions of our neighbor oblivious link reversal algorithms."

The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy\nusers with density \\lambda^{(p)} and the secondary network consists of Poisson\ndistributed cognitive radio users with density \\lambda^{(s)} =\n(\\lambda^{(p)})^{\\beta} (\\beta>0, \\beta \\neq 1) that utilize the spectrum\nopportunistically. Both networks are decentralized and employ ALOHA medium\naccess protocols where the secondary nodes are additionally equipped with\nrange-limited perfect spectrum sensors to monitor and protect primary\ntransmissions. We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely \\beta>1 and\n0<\\beta<1. We show that in both cases, the two networks can achieve their\ncorresponding stand-alone throughput scaling even without secondary spectrum\nsensing (i.e., the sensing range set to zero); this implies the need for a more\ncomprehensive performance metric than just throughput scaling to evaluate the\ninfluence of the overlaid interactions. We thus introduce a new criterion,\ntermed the asymptotic multiplexing gain, which captures the effect of\ninter-network interferences with different spectrum sensing setups. With this\nmetric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve\nprimary network performance when \\beta>1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing\nturns out to be unnecessary when \\beta<1 and setting the secondary network's\nALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network\nperformance."

In order to fully exploit the benefits of this new technology,\nprotocols need to be devised which react efficiently to changes in the demand.\nThis paper argues that the field of online algorithms and competitive analysis\nprovides useful tools to deal with and reason about the uncertainty in the\nrequest dynamics, and to design algorithms with provable performance\nguarantees. As a case study, we describe a system (e.g., a gaming application)\nwhere network virtualization is used to support thin client applications for\nmobile devices to improve their QoS. By decoupling the service from the\nunderlying resource infrastructure, it can be migrated closer to the current\nclient locations while taking into account migration cost. This paper\nidentifies the major cost factors in such a system, and formalizes the\ncorresponding optimization problem. Both randomized and deterministic, gravity\ncenter based online algorithms are presented which achieve a good tradeoff\nbetween improved QoS and migration cost in the worst-case, both for service\nmigration within an infrastructure provider as well as for networks supporting\ncross-provider migration.

    "summary": "Tor is a popular low-latency anonymity network. However, Tor does not protect\nagainst the exploitation of an insecure application to reveal the IP address\nof, or trace, a TCP stream. In addition, because of the linkability of Tor\nstreams sent together over a single circuit, tracing one stream sent over a\ncircuit traces them all. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this linkability\nallows in practice to trace a significant number of streams originating from\nsecure (i.e., proxied) applications. In this paper, we show that linkability\nallows us to trace 193% of additional streams, including 27% of HTTP streams\npossibly originating from \"secure\" browsers. In particular, we traced 9% of Tor\nstreams carried by our instrumented exit nodes. Using BitTorrent as the\ninsecure application, we design two attacks tracing BitTorrent users on Tor. We\nrun these attacks in the wild for 23 days and reveal 10,000 IP addresses of Tor\nusers. Using these IP addresses, we then profile not only the BitTorrent\ndownloads but also the websites visited per country of origin of Tor users. We\nshow that BitTorrent users on Tor are over-represented in some countries as\ncompared to BitTorrent users outside of Tor. By analyzing the type of content\ndownloaded, we then explain the observed behaviors by the higher concentration\nof pornographic content downloaded at the scale of a country. Finally, we\npresent results suggesting the existence of an underground BitTorrent ecosystem\non Tor."

    "summary": "A widely adopted two-dimensional Markov chain model of the IEEE 802.11 DCF\nwas introduced by Bianchi to characterize the backoff behavior of a single node\nunder a saturated traffic condition. Using this approach, we propose a queuing\nmodel for the 802.11 DCF under a non-saturated traffic environment. The input\nbuffer of each node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, and the packet service time\ndistribution is derived from Markov state space of 802.11 DCF with the\nunderlying scheduling algorithm. The DCF defines two access mechanisms, namely\nthe Basic access mechanism and the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS)\naccess mechanism. Based on our model, performance analyses of both schemes are\nstudied with probabilistic exponential backoff scheduling. We obtain the\ncharacteristic equation of network throughput and expressions of packet\nqueueing delay. Specifically, we obtain the stable throughput and bounded delay\nregions with respect to the retransmission factor according to the basic\nqueueing analysis. For both access schemes, the bounded delay region is a\nsubset of the stable throughput region. Our results show that the RTS/CTS\naccess mechanism is more stable and performs better than the Basic access\nmechanism. The analysis in this paper is verified by simulation results."

The rationale is to mitigate\nthe delay induced by long-lived TCP flows over the pace of short TCP data\nrequests and to prevent dropped packets at the beginning of a connection and\nduring recovery period. Although the main target of this AQM is to accelerate\nshort TCP traffic, we show that FavorQueue does not only improve the\nperformance of short TCP traffic but also improves the performance of all TCP\ntraffic in terms of drop ratio and latency whatever the flow size. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that FavorQueue reduces the loss of a retransmitted\npacket, decreases the number of dropped packets recovered by RTO and improves\nthe latency up to 30% compared to DropTail.

    "summary": "Detecting misbehavior (such as transmissions of false information) in\nvehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is very important problem with wide range of\nimplications including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We\ndiscuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS)\ndesigned for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes.\nIn most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish\nreasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. Because\nof this (\\emph{rational behavior}), it is more important to detect false\ninformation than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of\ndata-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false\nalert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending\nout the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can independently\ndecide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is\nbased on the consistency of recent messages and new alert with reported and\nestimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making\nour MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. Instead of revoking all the secret\ncredentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes, we impose fines on\nmisbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging\nthem to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs\ninvolved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes."

    "summary": "In this paper we expose a dynamic traffic-classification scheme to support\nmultimedia applications such as voice and broadband video transmissions over\nIEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Obviously, over a Wi-Fi link\nand to better serve these applications - which normally have strict bounded\ntransmission delay or minimum link rate requirement - a service differentiation\ntechnique can be applied to the media traffic transmitted by the same mobile\nnode using the well-known 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)\nprotocol. However, the given EDCA mode does not offer user differentiation,\nwhich can be viewed as a deficiency in multi-access wireless networks.\nAccordingly, we propose a new inter-node priority access scheme for IEEE\n802.11e networks which is compatible with the EDCA scheme. The proposed scheme\njoins a dynamic user-weight to each mobile station depending on its outgoing\ndata, and therefore deploys inter-node priority for the channel access to\ncomplement the existing EDCA inter-frame priority. This provides efficient\nquality of service control across multiple users within the same coverage area\nof an access point. We provide performance evaluations to compare the proposed\naccess model with the basic EDCA 802.11 MAC protocol mode to elucidate the\nquality improvement achieved for multimedia communication over 802.11 WLANs."

An efficient channel allocation\nscheme can significantly reduce call-blocking and calldropping probabilities.\nAnother important issue is to effectively manage the power requirements for\ncommunication. An efficient power control strategy leads to reduced power\nconsumption and improved signal quality. In this paper, we present a novel\ninteger linear program (ILP) formulation that jointly optimizes channel\nallocation and power control for incoming calls, based on the\ncarrier-to-interference ratio (CIR). In our approach we use a hybrid channel\nassignment scheme, where an incoming call is admitted only if a suitable\nchannel is found such that the CIR of all ongoing calls on that channel, as\nwell as that of the new call, will be above a specified value. Our formulation\nalso guarantees that the overall power requirement for the selected channel\nwill be minimized as much as possible and that no ongoing calls will be dropped\nas a result of admitting the new call. We have run simulations on a benchmark\n49 cell environment with 70 channels to investigate the effect of different\nparameters such as the desired CIR.

With the signature-and-verification based defense mechanisms available\ntoday, unfortunately, there is a lack of hierarchical architecture, which makes\nthe structure of the trust alliance excessively flat and single. Moreover, with\nthe increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly\nthat they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with\ntraditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain\nauthenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone\nemploys two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical\npartitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct\ntrustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences\nand complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also\nindicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a\nhierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and\n\"multi-fence support\" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme."

    "summary": "Target coverage problem in wireless sensor networks is concerned with\nmaximizing the lifetime of the network while continuously monitoring a set of\ntargets. A sensor covers targets which are within the sensing range. For a set\nof sensors and a set of targets, the sensor-target coverage relationship is\nassumed to be known. A sensor cover is a set of sensors that covers all the\ntargets. The target coverage problem is to determine a set of sensor covers\nwith maximum aggregated lifetime while constraining the life of each sensor by\nits initial battery life. The problem is proved to be NP-complete and heuristic\nalgorithms to solve this problem are proposed. In the present study, we give a\nunified interpretation of earlier algorithms and propose a new and efficient\nalgorithm. We show that all known algorithms are based on a common reasoning\nthough they seem to be derived from different algorithmic paradigms. We also\nshow that though some algorithms guarantee bound on the quality of the\nsolution, this bound is not meaningful and not practical too. Our\ninterpretation provides a better insight to the solution techniques. We propose\na new greedy heuristic which prioritizes sensors on residual battery life. We\nshow empirically that the proposed algorithm outperforms all other heuristics\nin terms of quality of solution. Our experimental study over a large set of\nrandomly generated problem instances also reveals that a very na\\\"ive greedy\napproach yields solutions which is reasonably (appx. 10%) close to the actual\noptimal solutions."

    "summary": "This paper considers non-cooperative and fully-distributed power-allocation\nfor secondary-users (SUs) in spectrum-sharing environments when\nnormalized-interference to each secondary-user is uncertain. We model each\nuncertain parameter by the sum of its nominal (estimated) value and a bounded\nadditive error in a convex set, and show that the allocated power always\nconverges to its equilibrium, called robust Nash equilibrium (RNE). In the case\nof a bounded and symmetric uncertainty set, we show that the power allocation\nproblem for each SU is simplified, and can be solved in a distributed manner.\nWe derive the conditions for RNE's uniqueness and for convergence of the\ndistributed algorithm; and show that the total throughput (social utility) is\nless than that at NE when RNE is unique. We also show that for multiple RNEs,\nthe the social utility may be higher at a RNE as compared to that at the\ncorresponding NE, and demonstrate that this is caused by SUs' orthogonal\nutilization of bandwidth for increasing the social utility. Simulations confirm\nour analysis."

Using a pull approach, nodes\nstore the data in their local flash memory, and only engage in commu- nication\nduring dedicated collection phases. We show how one can transform an existing\npush-based collection protocol into a pull-based one, and compare the power\nconsumption of both approaches on a 35-node testbed.

Such cases will end the automated business work, and force\nbusiness users to continue business procedures and functionalities via paper\nwork, which causes additional resources with less business competitive\nadvantages. In this paper, we will propose a new model in which we embed short\nmessage services (SMS) within business applications using the SMS Gateway such\nas \"Ozeki Message Server\", and programmed application packages. By using our\nproposed model, we can maintain business continuity when a partial disruption\noccurs and then switch to our application model. As a result to the\nexperimental work, we conclude that our model supports business continuity\nsince it supports the account balance modification while the database link is\ndisrupted. In addition, we carried out each step twice and the scenario was\nreliable since all of its steps were reliable."

    "summary": "Several emerging classes of applications that run over wireless networks have\na need for mathematical models and tools to systematically characterize the\nreliability of the network. We propose two metrics for measuring the\nreliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for\nunicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the\nend-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after\nhearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF)\nmetric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node\nretransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an\nacknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet\nforwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of\nthe end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities\nand the underlying connectivity graph.\n  We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to\nconstruct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each\nlink is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of\ndecreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing\ntopology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a\nmore reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG."

    "summary": "The importance of wireless communication is increasing day by day throughout\nthe world due to cellular and broadband technologies. Everyone around the world\nwould like to be connected seamlessly anytime anywhere through the best\nnetwork. The 4G wireless system must have the capability to provide high data\ntransfer rates, quality of services and seamless mobility. In 4G, there are a\nlarge variety of heterogeneous networks. The users for variety of applications\nwould like to utilize heterogeneous networks on the basis of their preferences\nsuch as real time, high availability and high bandwidth. When connections have\nto switch between heterogeneous networks for performance and high availability\nreasons, seamless vertical handoff is necessary. The requirements like\ncapability of the network, handoff latency, network cost, network conditions,\npower consumption and user's preferences must be taken into consideration\nduring vertical handoff. In this paper, we have extracted the requirements of a\nvertical handoff from the literature surveyed. The evaluation of the existing\nwork is also being done on the basis of required parameters for vertical\nhandoff. A sophisticated, adaptive and intelligent approach is required to\nimplement the vertical handoff mechanism in 4G wireless networks to produce an\neffective service for the user by considering dynamic and non dynamic\nparameters."

    "summary": "Loss tomography has received considerable attention in recent years and a\nnumber of estimators based on maximum likelihood (ML) or Bayesian principles\nhave been proposed. Almost all of the estimators are devoted to the tree\ntopology despite the general topology is more common in practice. There has\nbeen few likelihood function devoted to the general topology, not to mention\nthe estimator. To overcome this, two sets of sufficient statistics for the tree\nand general topologies, respectively, are proposed in this paper. Using the\nstatistics, two likelihood functions, one for a topology, are proposed here and\nsubsequently two likelihood equations for the general topology, one is\nlink-based and the other is path-based, are obtained. In addition, a dependence\nbetween subtrees in terms of their estimates is identified for the general\ntopology and a divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed to deal with the\ndependence, which divides a general network into two types of independent\ntrees. Further, two algorithms, one for a type of the independent trees, are\nproposed to estimate the loss rates of each type."

    "summary": "Loss tomography has been studied for more than 10 years and a number of\nestimators have been proposed. The estimators can be divided into two classes:\nmaximum likelihood and non-maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood\nestimators rely on the maximum likelihood principle to ensure the accuracy of\nthe estimates obtained by the estimators. Unfortunately, all of the maximum\nlikelihood estimators need to use an iterative procedure to search the solution\nspace for the maximum or to solve a high degree polynomial. An iterative\nprocedure can be computationally expensive and may even converge to a local\nmaximum. On the other hand, the non-maximum likelihood estimators pursue closed\nform solutions by scarifying the accuracy of estimates. To overcome the\npitfalls, we, in this paper, propose a closed form and maximum likelihood\nestimator to estimate the loss rate of a link in a network. The closed form\nsolution is built on the discovery of a connection between the number of probes\npassing a link and the number of probes passing its parent. The proposed\nestimator is applicable to both the tree topology and the general one."

    "summary": "Communication protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) follow either an\nOptimum Routing Approach (ORA) or the Least Overhead Routing Approach (LORA):\nWith ORA, protocols tend to determine and use the optimal communication\nstructure at every time instant; whereas with LORA, a protocol tends to use a\nchosen communication structure as long as it exists. In this paper, we study\nthe impact of the ORA and LORA strategies on minimum hop routes and minimum\nconnected dominating sets (MCDS) in MANETs. Our primary hypothesis is that the\nLORA strategy could yield routes with a larger time-averaged hop count and MCDS\nnode size when compared to the minimum hop count of routes and the node size of\nthe MCDS determined using the ORA strategy. Our secondary hypothesis is that\nthe impact of ORA vs. LORA also depends on how long the communication structure\nis being used. Our hypotheses are evaluated using extensive simulations under\ndiverse conditions of network density, node mobility and mobility models such\nas the Random Waypoint model, City Section model and the Manhattan model. In\nthe case of minimum hop routes, which exist for relatively a much longer time\ncompared to the MCDS, the hop count of routes maintained according to LORA,\neven though not dramatically high, is appreciably larger (6-12%) than those\nmaintained according to ORA; on the other hand, the number of nodes\nconstituting a MCDS maintained according to LORA is only at most 6% larger than\nthe node size of a MCDS maintained under the ORA strategy."

The\nsoftware consisted of a program module developed in Python to control the\nmicroprocessors of the nodes; and a database controlled by a simple program to\nmanage the tag IDs of people wearing them. The WSN and RFID nodes were\nconnected through I2C interfacing. Also, the work of sending commands to the\nRFID node, to make it read a tag and send it back to the computer, was\naccomplished by the Python code developed which also controls the data signals.\nAt the computer, the received tag ID is evaluated with other existing tag IDs\non the database, to check if that tag has authorization or not to be in the\ncovered area.

    "summary": "Due to the increasing demand of capacity in wireless cellular networks, the\nsmall cells such as pico and femto cells are becoming more popular to enjoy a\nspatial reuse gain, and thus cells with different sizes are expected to coexist\nin a complex manner. In such a heterogeneous environment, the role of\ninterference management (IM) becomes of more importance, but technical\nchallenges also increase, since the number of cell-edge users, suffering from\nsevere interference from the neighboring cells, will naturally grow. In order\nto overcome low performance and/or high complexity of existing static and other\ndynamic IM algorithms, we propose a novel low-complex and fully distributed IM\nscheme, called REFIM, in the downlink of heterogeneous multi-cell networks. We\nfirst formulate a general optimization problem that turns out to require\nintractable computation complexity for global optimality. To have a practical\nsolution with low computational and signaling overhead, which is crucial for\nlow-cost small-cell solutions, e.g., femto cells, in REFIM, we decompose it\ninto per-BS problems based on the notion of reference user and reduce feedback\noverhead over backhauls both temporally and spatially. We evaluate REFIM\nthrough extensive simulations under various configurations, including the\nscenarios from a real deployment of BSs. We show that, compared to the schemes\nwithout IM, REFIM can yield more than 40% throughput improvement of cell-edge\nusers while increasing the overall performance by 10~107%. This is equal to\nabout 95% performance of the existing centralized IM algorithm that is known to\nbe near-optimal but hard to implement in practice due to prohibitive\ncomplexity. We also present that as long as interference is managed well, the\nspectrum sharing policy can outperform the best spectrum splitting policy where\nthe number of subchannels is optimally divided between macro and femto cells."

Refer to some experiments, the\nmatchmaking to be most useful in two different ways: locating information\nsources or services that appear dynamically and notification of information\nchanges. Effective information and services sharing in distributed such as P2P\nbased environments raises many challenges, including discovery and localization\nof resources, exchange over heterogeneous sources, and query processing. One\ntraditional approach for dealing with some of the above challenges is to create\nunified integrated schemas or services to combine the heterogeneous sources.\nThis approach does not scale well when applied in dynamic distributed\nenvironments and has many drawbacks related to the large numbers of sources.\nThe main issues in matchmaking are how to represent advertising and request,\nand how to calculate possibility matching between advertising and request. The\nadvertising and request can represent data or services by using many model of\nrepresentation. In this paper, we address an approach of matchmaking by\nconsidering semantic agreement between sources."

    "summary": "Understanding queuing dynamics of TCP is important for correct router buffer\nsizing as well as for optimizing the performance of the TCP protocol itself.\nHowever, modeling of buffer content dynamics under TCP has received relatively\nlittle attention given its importance. Commonly used queuing models are based\non overly simplistic assumptions about the packet arrival process. As a\nconsequence, there are no quantitatively accurate closed loop TCP models\ncapable of predicting performance even for a single link shared by multiple\nflows. Our present paper aims to close this gap by proposing a simple TCP\nqueuing model, which is based on experimental observations and validated by\nextensive packet level simulations."

Fibonacci cubes (FC), Extended Fibonacci cubes (ELC) and Lucas cubes (LC)\nare subgraphs of hypercube defined in terms of Fibonacci strings. All these\ncubes were introduced in the last ten years as models for interconnection\nnetworks and shown that their network topology posseses many interesting\nproperties that are important in parallel processor network design and parallel\napplications. In this paper, we propose a new family of Fibonacci-like cube,\nnamely Extended Lucas Cube (ELC). We address the following network simulation\nproblem : Given a linear array, a ring or a two-dimensional mesh; how can its\nnodes be assigned to ELC nodes so as to keep their adjacent nodes near each\nother in ELC ?. We first show a simple fact that there is a Hamiltonian path\nand cycle in any ELC. We prove that any linear array and ring network can be\nembedded into its corresponding optimum ELC (the smallest ELC with at least the\nnumber of nodes in the ring) with dilation 1, which is optimum for most cases.\nThen, we describe dilation 1 embeddings of a class of meshes into their\ncorresponding optimum ELC."

We show by the simulation results that our proposed plan performs\nbetter than the existing resource allocation schemes in static allocation\nscenario. Next, we propose to make our resource allocation plan dynamic and\nself-organized. The distinct features of our proposed plan are: One, it\nachieves a trade-off between the system's area spectral efficiency and the edge\nuser's spectral efficiency performance.

Heterogeneous networks combine\nmultiple of these radio interfaces both in network infrastructure and in user\nequipment which requires a new multi-radio framework, enabling mobility and\nhandover management for multiple RATs. The use of heterogeneous networks can\ncapitalize on the overlapping coverage and allow user devices to take advantage\nof the fact that there are multiple radio interfaces. This paper presents the\nfunctional architecture for such a framework and proposes a generic signaling\nexchange applicable to a range of different handover management protocols that\nenables seamless mobility.

With the\ncontinuing deployment of different access networks, the wider range of\napplications tailored for a mobile environment, and a larger diversity of\nwireless end systems, it emerged that a single mobility protocol (such as\nMobile IP) is not sufficient to handle the different requirements adequately.\nThus a solution is needed to manage multiple mobility protocols in end systems\nand network nodes, to detect and select the required protocols, versions and\noptional features, and enable control on running daemons.

The\nmain motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced\neffect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates\nthe fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering\nschemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size\nvariation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size\nbuffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can\nbe either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness\nin size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an\nobvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation. Hence\nthe fixed-interval buffering scheme is a risk-averse strategy for its\nrobustness in a variety of operational environments. In addition, based on the\nfixed-interval buffering scheme, we establish the power consumption\nrelationship between child nodes and parent node in a static data collection\ntree, and give an in-depth analysis of the impact of child bandwidth\ndistribution on parent's power consumption.\n  This study is of practical significance: it sheds new light on the\nrelationship among power consumption of buffering schemes, power parameters of\nradio module and memory bank, data arrival rate and data size variation,\nthereby providing well-informed guidance in determining an optimal buffer size\n(interval) to maximize the operational lifespan of sensor networks."

    "summary": "Clustering is an important research topic for wireless sensor networks\n(WSNs). A large variety of approaches has been presented focusing on different\nperformance metrics. Even though all of them have many practical applications,\nan extremely limited number of software implementations is available to the\nresearch community. Furthermore, these very few techniques are implemented for\nspecific WSN systems or are integrated in complex applications. Thus it is very\ndifficult to comparatively study their performance and almost impossible to\nreuse them in future applications under a different scope. In this work we\nstudy a large body of well established algorithms. We identify their main\nbuilding blocks and propose a component-based architecture for developing\nclustering algorithms that (a) promotes exchangeability of algorithms thus\nenabling the fast prototyping of new approaches, (b) allows cross-layer\nimplementations to realize complex applications, (c) offers a common platform\nto comparatively study the performance of different approaches, (d) is hardware\nand OS independent. We implement 5 well known algorithms and discuss how to\nimplement 11 more. We conduct an extended simulation study to demonstrate the\nfaithfulness of our implementations when compared to the original\nimplementations. Our simulations are at very large scale thus also\ndemonstrating the scalability of the original algorithms beyond their original\npresentations. We also conduct experiments to assess their practicality in real\nWSNs. We demonstrate how the implemented clustering algorithms can be combined\nwith routing and group key establishment algorithms to construct WSN\napplications. Our study clearly demonstrates the applicability of our approach\nand the benefits it offers to both research & development communities."

    "summary": "Relay-assisted cooperative wireless communication has been shown to have\nsignificant performance gains over the legacy direct transmission scheme.\nCompared with single relay based cooperation schemes, utilizing multiple relays\nfurther improves the reliability and rate of transmissions. Distributed\nspace-time coding (DSTC), as one of the schemes to utilize multiple relays,\nrequires tight coordination between relays and does not perform well in a\ndistributed environment with mobility. In this paper, a cooperative medium\naccess control (MAC) layer protocol, called \\emph{STiCMAC}, is designed to\nallow multiple relays to transmit at the same time in an IEEE 802.11 network.\nThe transmission is based on a novel DSTC scheme called \\emph{randomized\ndistributed space-time coding} (\\emph{R-DSTC}), which requires minimum\ncoordination. Unlike conventional cooperation schemes that pick nodes with good\nlinks, \\emph{STiCMAC} picks a \\emph{transmission mode} that could most improve\nthe end-to-end data rate. Any station that correctly receives from the source\ncan act as a relay and participate in forwarding. The MAC protocol is\nimplemented in a fully decentralized manner and is able to opportunistically\nrecruit relays on the fly, thus making it \\emph{robust} to channel variations\nand user mobility. Simulation results show that the network capacity and delay\nperformance are greatly improved, especially in a mobile environment."

    "summary": "The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was proposed in 2006 for\napplication in wireless networks. Since then it has developed into a subfield\nof network coding with wide followings. The basic idea of PNC is to exploit the\nnetwork coding operation that occurs naturally when electromagnetic (EM) waves\nare superimposed on one another. This simple idea turns out to have profound\nand fundamental ramifications. Subsequent works by various researchers have led\nto many new results in the domains of 1) wireless communication; 2) wireless\ninformation theory; and 3) wireless networking. The purpose of this paper is\nfourfold. First, we give a brief tutorial on the basic concept of PNC. Second,\nwe survey and discuss recent key results in the three aforementioned areas.\nThird, we examine a critical issue in PNC: synchronization. It has been a\ncommon belief that PNC requires tight synchronization. Our recent results\nsuggest, however, that PNC may actually benefit from asynchrony. Fourth, we\npropose that PNC is not just for wireless networks; it can also be useful in\noptical networks. We provide an example showing that the throughput of a\npassive optical network (PON) could potentially be raised by 100% with PNC."

    "summary": "Traceroute measurements are one of our main instruments to shed light onto\nthe structure and properties of today's complex networks such as the Internet.\nThis paper studies the feasibility and infeasibility of inferring the network\ntopology given traceroute data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any\nprobabilistic assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend\nto a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose two\nfundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the traceroute data: (1)\neach trace corresponds to a real path in the network, and (2) the routing paths\nare at most a factor 1/alpha off the shortest paths, for some parameter alpha\nin (0,1]. In contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of\nthe set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that a large\nnumber of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic, as long as the\nnetworks have a similar structure. We hence seek to characterize the set of\ntopologies inferred with our axioms. We introduce the notion of star graphs\nwhose colorings capture the differences among inferred topologies; it also\nallows us to construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,\ninferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important aspects, such\nas the nodes' distances or the number of triangles. These negative results are\ncomplemented by a discussion of a scenario where the trace set is best\npossible, i.e., \"complete\". It turns out that while some properties such as the\nnode degrees are still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to\ndetermine global properties such as the connectivity."

    "summary": "Deployment of multimedia applications warrants provisioning of Quality of\nService (QoS) in MANET. However, limited battery power, other resource\nconstraints and mobility of nodes make QoS provisioning difficult to achieve in\nMANET. This difficulty can be overcome by using a cross-layer approach for\nrouting. In [1] Patil et al., proposed a cross-layer routing protocol named\nCost Based Power Aware Cross Layer - AODV (CPACL-AODV) which overcomes the\nlimitation of battery power of nodes. Though many similar energy efficient and\ncross-layer routing protocols have been proposed for MANET, none of them\nhandles QoS. A novel MANET routing protocol, Type of Service, Power and\nBandwidth Aware AODV (TSPBA-AODV), which overcomes resource constraints and\nsimultaneously provides QoS guarantees using a cross-layer approach, is\nproposed in this paper. In addition the effect of variation in nodes' mobility\non performance of TSPBA-AODV is compared with that of CPACL-AODV [1] for two\ndifferent types of network traffic. As shown by the results of simulations\nperformed, TSPBA-AODV performs better than CPACL-AODV for MANET in which nodes\nmove with small speeds (speeds up to 40 Km/hr approx.). In addition the effect\nof variation in data sending rate of nodes on performance of the protocols is\nalso studied. As shown by the results of simulations performed, TSPBA-AODV\nperforms better than CPACL-AODV for all variations in data sending rate of\nnodes."

    "summary": "Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are a set of mobile nodes which are\nself-configuring and connected by wireless links automatically as per the\ndefined routing protocol. The absence of a central management agency or a fixed\ninfrastructure is a key feature of MANETs. These nodes communicate with each\nother by interchange of packets, which for those nodes not in wireless range\ngoes hop by hop. Due to lack of a defined central authority, securitizing the\nrouting process becomes a challenging task thereby leaving MANETs vulnerable to\nattacks, which results in deterioration in the performance characteristics as\nwell as raises a serious question mark about the reliability of such networks.\nIn this paper we have attempted to present an overview of the routing\nprotocols, the known routing attacks and the proposed countermeasures to these\nattacks in various works."

    "summary": "Classifying network traffic according to their application-layer protocols is\nan important task in modern networks for traffic management and network\nsecurity. Existing payload-based or statistical methods of application\nidentification cannot meet the demand of both high performance and accurate\nidentification at the same time. We propose an application identification\nframework that classifies traffic at aggregate-flow level leveraging\naggregate-flow cache. A detailed traffic classifier designed based on this\nframework is illustrated to improve the throughput of payload-based\nidentification methods. We further optimize the classifier by proposing an\nefficient design of aggregate-flow cache. The cache design employs a\nfrequency-based, recency-aware replacement algorithm based on the analysis of\ntemporal locality of aggregate-flow cache. Experiments on real-world traces\nshow that our traffic classifier with aggregate-flow cache can reduce up to 95%\nworkload of backend identification engine. The proposed cache replacement\nalgorithm outperforms well-known replacement algorithms, and achieves 90% of\nthe optimal performance using only 15% of memory. The throughput of a\npayload-based identification system, L7-filter [1], is increased by up to 5.1\ntimes by using our traffic classifier design."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of quickest event detection with sleep-wake\nscheduling in small extent wireless sensor networks in which, at each time\nslot, each sensor node in the awake state observes a sample and communicates\nthe information to the fusion centre. The sensor nodes in the sleep state do\nnot sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby\nconserving energy. At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples\nfrom the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus\ndeclare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing. If it decides to\ncontinue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes\nto be in the wake state in the next time slot. We consider three alternative\napproaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nwake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k,\nnamely, 1. optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nawake state in time slot k+1, 2. optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of\na sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and 3. optimal\nprobability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot. In\neach case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process. We show\nthat a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori\nprobability of change Pi_k. Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a\nthreshold rule on Pi_k. The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few\nsensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of\nsensors in the wake state when a change is \"suspected\". Among the three\nsleep-wake algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for\nthe optimum control of M_{k+1} and is maximum for the optimum control on q."

    "summary": "We consider a small extent sensor network for event detection, in which nodes\ntake samples periodically and then contend over a {\\em random access network}\nto transmit their measurement packets to the fusion center. We consider two\nprocedures at the fusion center to process the measurements. The Bayesian\nsetting is assumed; i.e., the fusion center has a prior distribution on the\nchange time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion\ncenter is \\emph{network-oblivious} and makes a decision only when a complete\nvector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second\nprocedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is \\emph{network-aware}\nand processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time causal order. In this\ncase, the decision statistic depends on the network delays as well, whereas in\nthe network-oblivious case, the decision statistic does not depend on the\nnetwork delays. This yields a Bayesian change detection problem with a tradeoff\nbetween the random network delay and the decision delay; a higher sampling rate\nreduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under\nperiodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal\nstopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change\ndetection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay\nwithout the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem\nis analysed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the\nstates of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A\nsufficient statistic for decision is found to be the network-state and the\nposterior probability of change having occurred given the measurements received\nand the state of the network. The optimal regimes are studied using simulation."

    "summary": "In recent years, efficient energy utilization becomes an essential\nrequirement for data centers, especially in data centers of world-leading\ncompanies, where \"Green Data Center\" defines a new term for an\nenvironment-concerned data center. Solutions to change existing a data center\nto the green one may vary. In the big company, high-cost approaches including\nre-planning server rooms, changing air-conditioners, buying low-powered\nservers, and equipping sophisticating environmental control equipments are\npossible, but not for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and academic sectors\nwhich have limited budget. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SENVM,\nused to monitor and control air temperature in a server room to be in\nappropriate condition, not too cold, where very unnecessary cooling leads to\nunnecessary extra electricity expenses, and also inefficient in energy\nutilization. With implementing on an emerging technology, Wireless Sensor\nNetwork (WSN), Green Data Center is feasible to every small data center with no\nwiring installation, easy deployment, and low maintenance fee. In addition, the\nprototype of the system has been tested, and the first phase of the project is\ndeployed in a real-world data center."

    "summary": "In designing wireless sensor networks, it is important to reduce energy\ndissipation and prolong network lifetime. In this paper, a new model with\nenergy and monitored objects heterogeneity is proposed for heterogeneous\nwireless sensor networks. We put forward an energy-efficient prediction\nclustering algorithm, which is adaptive to the heterogeneous model. This\nalgorithm enables the nodes to select the cluster head according to factors\nsuch as energy and communication cost, thus the nodes with higher residual\nenergy have higher probability to become a cluster head than those with lower\nresidual energy, so that the network energy can be dissipated uniformly. In\norder to reduce energy consumption when broadcasting in clustering phase and\nprolong network lifetime, an energy consumption prediction model is established\nfor regular data acquisition nodes. Simulation results show that compared with\ncurrent clustering algorithms, this algorithm can achieve longer sensor network\nlifetime, higher energy efficiency and superior network monitoring quality."

The 3GPP LTE-A uplink allows for precoded\nmulti-stream (precoded MIMO) transmission from each scheduled user and also\nallows flexible multi-user (MU) scheduling wherein multiple users can be\nassigned the same time-frequency resource. However, exploiting these features\nis made challenging by certain practical constraints that have been imposed in\norder to maintain a low signaling overhead. We show that while the scheduling\nproblem in the 3GPP LTE-A cellular uplink is NP-hard, it can be formulated as\nthe maximization of a submodular set function subject to one matroid and\nmultiple knapsack constraints.
