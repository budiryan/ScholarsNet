    "summary": "This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning\nbased on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy\nof smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an\nadditive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper\ndefines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational\npower, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions.\nThe paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves\nthat it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known\nas a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of\nstate abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q\nthrough a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that\nMAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much\nfaster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the\nvalue function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and\nexecute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the\npolicy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the\neffectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the\npaper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the\ndesign tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning."

    "summary": "Many researchers have explored methods for hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning (RL) with temporal abstractions, in which abstract actions are defined\nthat can perform many primitive actions before terminating. However, little is\nknown about learning with state abstractions, in which aspects of the state\nspace are ignored. In previous work, we developed the MAXQ method for\nhierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state\nabstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We\nprove that the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges under these conditions and\nshow experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful\napplication of MAXQ-Q learning."

The multiplicative updating rule\nhere constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and\nhas numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one\nconsequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function,\nfunctions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen.

    "summary": "In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target\noperating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs.\nThis uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We\nshow that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at\nleast as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In\nsome cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best\nknown classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of\ncomparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy,\nexpected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid\nalso is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a\nmethod for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise\nclass distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH)\nmethod combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and\ncomputational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned\nclassifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management\nof classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and\nsensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust\nhybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems."

    "summary": "When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning\ntechniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency.\nInductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also\nless efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic\nprogramming systems are small according to general standards within the data\nmining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that\nseveral examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled\nindependently.\n  Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic\nprogramming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing\nILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context\nof relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and\nto the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations\ncorresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the\nexpressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a\nlarge extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).\n  As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system\nTilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which\nloads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by\none. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can\nhandle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed\nscales up linearly in the number of examples."

This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set\nof those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to\nselect networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on\nthe error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous\npaper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.\n  The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree\n\\Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for\nconstant \\Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can\nbe found by convex optimization."

This is the first algorithm for learning decision\nlists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running\ntime in the relevant parameters.

For a wide range of parameters our construction\nmatches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives\nan essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree\nand weight.\n  Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$\nout of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$.\nFor $k=o(\\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample\ncomplexity $o(n)$.

We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N\npoints remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N\n-> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is\nthe expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0.

    "summary": "We present in this work a new methodology to design kernels on data which is\nstructured with smaller components, such as text, images or sequences. This\nmethodology is a template procedure which can be applied on most kernels on\nmeasures and takes advantage of a more detailed \"bag of components\"\nrepresentation of the objects. To obtain such a detailed description, we\nconsider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of\nnested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then\nconsider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed\nperspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global\nor coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution\napproach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not\nprecise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global\nsimilarities is necessary to compare objects. The approach presented here would\nnot be computationally tractable without a factorization trick that we\nintroduce before presenting promising results on an image retrieval task."

    "summary": "Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence\nassumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong\nindependence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that\nrelaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve\nthe classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an\noptimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring\nmeasure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time\noptimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have\nexamined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a\nNaive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN\nstructure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and\npresent a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to\nMDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the\naugmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a\nrelaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search\nmethods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The\nauthors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed\nmisclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL. In this\npaper, we present a simple, polynomial time greedy algorithm for learning an\noptimal Augmented Bayes Network with respect to MDL score."

The\nestimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as\nprobabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models\nbased on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA\nare called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic\nlanguages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical\nrepresentation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable,\nit is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES,\nintroduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is\nnot proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA\nthat do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use\nthese MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader\nclass of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages.\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of\npseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for\nexample that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have\ncarried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical\ninference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms\nthem in most cases."

De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical\npropositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We\nare inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the\nVersion space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to\nslightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a\nsolution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information\nconcerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First,\nuncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second,\ngeneralization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the\nexample is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of\nincompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is\nknown. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as \"learning from\npossibilities\" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific\nlearning setting, referred to as \"assumption-based learning\" that cope with\nexamples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual\ninformation outside of the proper description of the examples.

We place ourselves\nin the situation of a user who only provides a stopping parameter and a\nprobabilistic weak learner/classifier and compare three types of boosting\nalgorithms: probabilistic Adaboost, decision tree, and tree of trees of ... of\ntrees, which we call matryoshka. \"Nested tree,\" \"embedded tree\" and \"recursive\ntree\" are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our\ncontributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the\nalgorithms, in which we give training error bounds. This analysis suggests that\nthe matryoshka leverages probabilistic weak classifiers more efficiently than\nsimple decision trees."

Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the\nseparation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence\non the minimum mixing weight.

    "summary": "Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when\napplied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT\nalgorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper\nConfidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to\nthe effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too\n``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the\ndepth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search.\nFirst, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales\nexponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D\n\\sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then\nanalyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with\nhigh probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth\nTrees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing\nefficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we\npresent an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is\ntoo big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high\nprobability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed.\nWe illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz\nfunction, given noisy data."

This identity potentially provides a new application\ndomain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce\nimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm\nfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO\nproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two\ncontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution\nwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and\nbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures\nignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated\nvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations\nare considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location\ninformation using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample\nlocations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an\nadditional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO."

    "summary": "For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\\omega,x)$,\nmodels of $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have\nbeen shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor\nclassification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties\nof that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can\nreconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\\omega|x)$\ngiven $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class\nlabels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It\nalso shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a\nclassifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves\nBayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity\nin a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification\ntasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class\nposterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper\nidentifies a distinct class of classification problems using\n$P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\\omega\\eq\\omega'|x,x')$ to\nsolve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution."

    "summary": "Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are\nsingular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher\ninformation matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the\nBayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the\nmaximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main\nreason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances\nfrom trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes\ngeneralization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error,\nand (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations\namong these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states\nin statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any\nparametric model, and any a priori distribution. Also we show that Bayes and\nGibbs generalization errors are estimated by Bayes and Gibbs training errors,\nand propose widely applicable information criteria which can be applied to both\nregular and singular statistical models."

Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the\nproblem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe\ntournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance\nestimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.\n  We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two\nalgorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The\nfirst one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same\nnumber (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second\none, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear\nnumber of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.\n  We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be\nimproved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation."

The structural diversity was induced by having\ndifferent architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical\nAlgorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the\nclassification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9\nclassifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the\nensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity\nmeasure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used\nto measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to\naggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a\ndiversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024\nas maximum diversity measured.

To perform this\nmodel selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its\nleave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization\nerror which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time\nrequirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the\nleave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among\nthose bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It\napplies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the\n2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2,\nas a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this\nmachine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established."

    "summary": "We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability\ndistributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et\nal 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely\nstudied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree\nseries which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of\nmultiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very\nconvenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees.\nFirst, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design\nlearning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by\nrational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series\ncorrespond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the\nstructure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can\nbe easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol\nmay have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly\nrelevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the\ninference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are\nequivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web\nInformation Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked\ntrees."

    "summary": "We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential\ndata with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled\nnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a\npositive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to\nnon-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive\ncombination of individually representable observations is also representable by\nthe network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in\ncomputational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the\nenvironment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding\nmagnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that\nleverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We\npresent a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation\ndata which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate\ntheir potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source\nseparation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized\nby a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our\nresults illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target\nobservation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple\nsimultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target\nstates degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also\npresent results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are\nextracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be\nuseful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also\npropose a network for language modeling."

    "summary": "In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously,\nwith the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each\ntask may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions\nfor supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including\na priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and\nhow they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume\nthat tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that\ntasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm\nthat encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the\npartition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization\nformulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic\nexamples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms\nwell-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non\nconvex methods dedicated to the same problem."

Assuming that my general notion of\nentropy reflects the true uncertainty about a probabilistic event, I understand\nthat our perceived uncertainty differs. I claim that our perception is the\nresult of two opposing forces similar to the two famous antagonists in Chinese\nphilosophy: Yin and Yang. Based on this idea, I show that our perceived\nuncertainty matches the true uncertainty in points determined by the golden\nratio. I demonstrate that the well-known sigmoid function, which we typically\nemploy in artificial neural networks as a non-linear threshold function,\ndescribes the actual performance. Furthermore, I provide a motivation for the\ntime dilation in Einstein's Special Relativity, basically claiming that\nalthough time dilation conforms with our perception, it does not correspond to\nreality. At the end of the paper, I show how to apply this theoretical\nframework to practical applications.

    "summary": "Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of\nthe complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In\ncontrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight\ngeneralization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by\nexploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,\nexisting stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the\nsamples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning\napplications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received\nby the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.\n  This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a\nstationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in\nthe study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between\nobservations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based\ngeneralization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.\nThese bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply\nto all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of\nstability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.\n  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to\ngeneral classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,\nKernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel\nregularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.\nThese novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the\nuse of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios."

Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes\ncan make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic\nflows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are\nspatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network.\nHence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how\naccurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes.\nConnection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is\noptimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is\ncomputationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work\ninvestigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows\nto preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop,\nbased on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed\nalgorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal\npreemption decisions.

    "summary": "The problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is\noften encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an\nunderlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer\nvision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient\nalgorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and\nproving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a\nsuccessful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the\nmathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of\nrealizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise\ndistances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of\nthe realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that\nbasic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness\nof low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that\ndistances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient\nrandomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion.\nCrucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix,\nthat serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix."

The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse\nthan each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously.\nIf the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all\nmixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same\nperformance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the\nstandard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the\ncase of \"specialist\" (or \"sleeping\") experts. In this case, the defensive\nforecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating\nAlgorithm."

    "summary": "Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose\nscaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers.\nWhen the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels\ngiven by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme\ncase, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally\nconsistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination,\nand discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We\ndefine a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of\nglobally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by\ndistributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the\nratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and\nthe number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed\nlabeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In\naddition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of\ncompletely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the\nratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of\nclasses drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0)."

    "summary": "Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for\nmodeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic\nBayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model\nrelationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are\nintractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as\nfrequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the\nrigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical\nmodels literature.\n  Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of\nresearch, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be\ninferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the\nmodeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter.\nFirst, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on\ninfluences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using\na greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN\nstructure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct\noccurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach,\nwe focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called\nexcitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can\nbe conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on\ndatasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real\nneuroscience datasets are presented.\n  Availability: Algorithmic implementations, simulator codebases, and datasets\nare available from our website at http://neural-code.cs.vt.edu/dbn"

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of\nWalley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability\ndistributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a\ncategorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state\nof prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem,\nanother state of beliefs, called \\emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed.\nNear-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles\nthat can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows\nlearning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial\nevidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the\nproblem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs.\nThe key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of\ninterest that is \\emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most\ncommon case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent\nvariables (and general \\emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if\nsatisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This\ncondition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical\nproblems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the\npossibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical\nproblems."

In addition to being theoretically elegant and\ncomputationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the\nform actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information\nis critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in\nthe manufacturing domain.

The three methods address different problems, and hence share\ndifferent kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three\nare based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL)\nprinciple and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first\nmethod, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for\nmultiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features.\nMIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models\nand is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a\nlarge pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our\nsecond method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case\nwhen the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method,\nTransfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task\nto which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have\ndifferent amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial\nwhen we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of\nlabeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different\nverbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental\nresults on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense\nDisambiguation (WSD)."

To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we\nproved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the\nBayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional\nvariance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity\ncontained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same\nequations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric\nmodel.

    "summary": "Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework\nfor density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost:\ninference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when\nconjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a\nmaximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search\nalgorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational\ntechniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by\nsearch can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that\nusing these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large\ndata sets."

Recent work has shown that the cellular simultaneous recurrent\nneural network (CSRN) can solve this problem for simple mazes. This thesis\nfocuses on exploiting relevant information about the maze to improve learning\nand decrease the training time for the CSRN to solve mazes. Appropriate\nvariables are identified to create useful clusters using relevant information.\nThe CSRN was next modified to allow for an additional external input. With this\nadditional input, several methods were tested and results show that clustering\nthe mazes improves the overall learning of the traversal problem for the CSRN."

By using ideas from Random projections we show that the\ncombinatorial dimension of SVMs is $O({log} n)$ with high probability. This\nestimate of combinatorial dimension is used to derive an iterative algorithm,\ncalled RandSVM, which at each step calls an existing solver to train SVMs on a\nrandomly chosen subset of size $O({log} n)$. The algorithm has probabilistic\nguarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification\nand regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets\ndemonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of\naccuracy."

    "summary": "Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation\nof functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately,\nexact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of\napproximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large\ndataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the\nvariable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have\nits own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We\ndescribe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by\nderiving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP\napproximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a\ncompact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we\nshow how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy.

The proposed approach consists of two main\nelements: (1) {\\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each\nsuccessive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy\nobservations, and (2) {\\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by\ncomparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive\nthreshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an\nend user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work\non online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions\ngiven all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter\nupdates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models\nwhich can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which\nyield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and\nslowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same\nexponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides\nwith the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game.

In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature\nby analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular,\nwe study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian --\nor, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.\n  We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption.\nFirst, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical\nGaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the\nsubspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an\nexact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm,\nwhen the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical\nGaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation\nbetween the mixture components.\n  Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2\nspherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required\nby a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample\nrequirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing\nseparation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we\nshow an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures\nof two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the\noverlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the\nsample requirement of $k$-means is {\\em near-optimal}."

This is possible under the assumption that observed\nvariables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise.\nPrevious results in the literature present solutions for the case where each\nobserved variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how\nto extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure\nmore than one latent variable."

Recently, it was discovered that the asymptotic learning curves in\nBayes estimation are subject to a universal law, even if the log likelihood\nfunction can not be approximated by any quadratic form. However, it is left\nunknown what mathematical property ensures such a universal law. In this paper,\nwe define a renormalizable condition of the statistical estimation problem, and\nshow that, under such a condition, the asymptotic learning curves are ensured\nto be subject to the universal law, even if the true distribution is\nunrealizable and singular for a statistical model. Also we study a\nnonrenormalizable case, in which the learning curves have the different\nasymptotic behaviors from the universal law."

    "summary": "This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoring the behavior of aircraft\nin a given airspace. Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data\ndriven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC)\nto guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the\nrunway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control\nof the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the\nflight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their\nvariability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is\nthen used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations\npreviously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is\npresented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in\nreal time. The airspace is \"healthy\" when all aircraft are flying according to\nthe nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the\nconformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does\nnot conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to\nensure a safe separation between aircraft."

As this academic performance is\ninfluenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining\nmodel for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study\nthe influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the\npresent investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to\ngenerate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary\nsource. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the\nsecondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational\nOfficer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different\nschools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data\nwas preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in\none form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result,\nwe had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model\nconstruction. A set of prediction rules were extracted from CHIAD prediction\nmodel and the efficiency of the generated CHIAD prediction model was found. The\naccuracy of the present model was compared with other model and it has been\nfound to be satisfactory."

    "summary": "A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in\norder to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate\nprediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many\napplications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from\ndata, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks\nsolving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible,\nand thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present\nDistributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for\nrepeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility\nof the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees\nthat apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural\ndiminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely\nlow communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We\nextend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection.

    "summary": "In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is\nasymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since\nmany learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior\nof the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established\nthe singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information\ncriterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the\naverage Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically\ncompare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information\ncriterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is\nasymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a\nrandom variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization\nusing these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the\nBayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is\nasymptotically equal to $2\\lambda/n$, where $\\lambda$ is the real log canonical\nthreshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation\nbetween the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined\nby the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify\nthat the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes\ncross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion."

    "summary": "In this paper, we formulate a novel problem for finding blackhole and volcano\npatterns in a large directed graph. Specifically, a blackhole pattern is a\ngroup which is made of a set of nodes in a way such that there are only inlinks\nto this group from the rest nodes in the graph. In contrast, a volcano pattern\nis a group which only has outlinks to the rest nodes in the graph. Both\npatterns can be observed in real world. For instance, in a trading network, a\nblackhole pattern may represent a group of traders who are manipulating the\nmarket. In the paper, we first prove that the blackhole mining problem is a\ndual problem of finding volcanoes. Therefore, we focus on finding the blackhole\npatterns. Along this line, we design two pruning schemes to guide the blackhole\nfinding process. In the first pruning scheme, we strategically prune the search\nspace based on a set of pattern-size-independent pruning rules and develop an\niBlackhole algorithm. The second pruning scheme follows a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy to further exploit the pruning results from the first pruning scheme.\nIndeed, a target directed graphs can be divided into several disconnected\nsubgraphs by the first pruning scheme, and thus the blackhole finding can be\nconducted in each disconnected subgraph rather than in a large graph. Based on\nthese two pruning schemes, we also develop an iBlackhole-DC algorithm. Finally,\nexperimental results on real-world data show that the iBlackhole-DC algorithm\ncan be several orders of magnitude faster than the iBlackhole algorithm, which\nhas a huge computational advantage over a brute-force method."

We define an algorithm to be\nresistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target\nfunction, it converges to accuracy 1 -- \\epsilon , with polynomial resources,\nand then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability\n\\epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the\nsense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query\ntechnique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain\nevolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on\nthe rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution\nalgorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an\nalgorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric\ndistribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O(\\epsilon /n), and another\nalgorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a\nsmaller drift rate.\n  The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness\nof the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second\nresult in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be\nconverted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point\nwithout the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting\npoint. This permits the somewhat unnatural feature of arbitrary performance\ndegradations to be removed from several known robustness translations."

A learning rule $\\mathcal L$ for a function class $\\mathscr F$ is\npredictive PAC if for every $\\e,\\delta>0$ and each function $f\\in {\\mathscr\nF}$, whenever $\\abs{\\sigma}\\geq s(\\delta,\\e)$, we have with confidence\n$1-\\delta$ that the expected difference between $f(X_{n+1})$ and the image of\n$f\\vert\\sigma$ under $\\mathcal L$ does not exceed $\\e$ conditionally on\n$X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n$. Thus, instead of learning the function $f$ as such, we\nare learning to a given accuracy $\\e$ the predictive behaviour of $f$ at the\nfuture points $X_i(\\omega)$, $i>n$ of the sample path. Using de Finetti's\ntheorem, we show that if a universally separable function class $\\mathscr F$ is\ndistribution-free PAC learnable under i.i.d. inputs, then it is\ndistribution-free predictive PAC learnable under exchangeable inputs, with a\nslightly worse sample complexity."

The focus is on the nonlinear\nnature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The\nmathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms\nadapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank\npositive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the\nliterature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned\nmatrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem\nsize and enjoy important invariance properties.

Special cases of this problem include collaborative filtering\nand link prediction. We present the first model for dyadic prediction that\nsatisfies several important desiderata: (i) labels may be ordinal or nominal,\n(ii) side-information can be easily exploited if present, (iii) with or without\nside-information, latent features are inferred for dyad members, (iv) it is\nresistant to sample-selection bias, (v) it can learn well-calibrated\nprobabilities, and (vi) it can scale to very large datasets. To our knowledge,\nno existing method satisfies all the above criteria. In particular, many\nmethods assume that the labels are ordinal and ignore side-information when it\nis present. Experimental results show that the new method is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art methods for the special cases of collaborative filtering and\nlink prediction, and that it makes accurate predictions on nominal data."

    "summary": "Over the last decade, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have\nsuccessfully been used in the machine learning community. The primary\nmathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch\ntechniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in\nthe context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have\nonly been focussed on real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge,\nno adaptive kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, for complex\nvalued signals. Furthermore, although the real reproducing kernels are used in\nan increasing number of machine learning problems, complex kernels have not,\nyet, been used, in spite of their potential interest in applications that deal\nwith complex signals, with Communications being a typical example. In this\npaper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive\nfiltering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking\nadvantage of a technique called \\textit{complexification} of real RKHSs, or\ncomplex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex gaussian\nkernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on\nthe associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's\nCalculus, which has recently attracted attention in the signal processing\ncommunity. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Wirtinger's calculus is\nextended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive\nseveral realizations of the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm.\nExperiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements\nover several linear and nonlinear algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities."

In the simplest such scheme one compares to the\nloss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the\ndata into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is\nappropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard\nfixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this\nscheme.\n  Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about\nhow they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the\nfollowing question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from\ndata in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first\ncase. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly\nwhen the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending\nfixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T\noutcomes.

In this\npaper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso\npenalized problem.

    "summary": "In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for multiclass boosting\nlearning. In the literature, AdaBoost.MO and AdaBoost.ECC are the two\nsuccessful multiclass boosting algorithms, which can use binary weak learners.\nWe explicitly derive these two algorithms' Lagrange dual problems based on\ntheir regularized loss functions. We show that the Lagrange dual formulations\nenable us to design totally-corrective multiclass algorithms by using the\nprimal-dual optimization technique. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest\nthat our multiclass boosting can achieve a comparable generalization capability\nwith state-of-the-art, but the convergence speed is much faster than stage-wise\ngradient descent boosting. In other words, the new totally corrective\nalgorithms can maximize the margin more aggressively."

    "summary": "Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas\nincluding machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm\nregularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many\napplications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group\nsparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,\nchallenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.\nExisting work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they\ncannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an\nefficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the\nL1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than\n1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the\nproposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why\nEP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the\nspecial cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient\nalgorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

    "summary": "An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has\nattracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various\nmachine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic\ndata modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An\nimportant challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational\nbottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus\nthe weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we\ndevelop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM\nsolutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this\ncontribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path\nalgorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight\nparameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that\nbreakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in\nhigh-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric\nrepresentation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation\nin weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the\ncurrent affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at\nintersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through\nextensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the\nusefulness of the proposed algorithm."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of\ndelay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. Existing\nresearch on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely\npower-control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), or system-level\nsolutions based on dynamic power management (DPM); however, there is currently\nno rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both\nphysical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum\npossible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of\nstochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. In this report,\nwe propose such a framework. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem\nas a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it online using reinforcement\nlearning. The advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does not\nrequire a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to\ndetermine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; (ii) it\nexploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to\nbe learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and\n(iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the\nadaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement\nlearning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can\nconverge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning\nalgorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude\nfaster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms."

The traditional approach solving this MDP problem involves\ncentralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low\ncomplexity solution, we introduce a linear structure which approximates the\nvalue function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value\nfunctions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control\npolicy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only.

To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance\nshrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and\nbenchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin\nNearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\ndistance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis\ndistance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster.

The proposed\nalgorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of\nthe criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM)\nalgorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard\nheuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The\nmonotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1)\nusing the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of\nmajorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along\nconstant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM.\nSimulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the\nME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be\nadapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty\nfunction of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF\n(when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace)."

The dynamic\nclustering control is adaptive to the global queue state information (GQSI)\nonly and computed at the base station controller (BSC) over a longer time\nscale. On the other hand, the power allocations of all the BSs in one cluster\nare adaptive to both intra-cluster channel state information (CCSI) and\nintra-cluster queue state information (CQSI), and computed at the cluster\nmanager (CM) over a shorter time scale.

By exploiting\nthe special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation\nin terms of Pattern Selection Q-factor to solve the CPOMDP. To address the\ndistributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and\ncomputational complexity, we approximate the Pattern Selection Q-factor by the\nsum of Per-cluster Potential functions and propose a novel distributive online\nlearning algorithm to estimate the Per-cluster Potential functions (at each CM)\nas well as the Lagrange multipliers (LM) (at each BS).

By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics,\nwe further decompose the Per-cluster Potential function into sum of Per-cluster\nPer-user Potential functions and formulate the instantaneous power allocation\nas a Per-stage QSI-aware Interference Game played among all the CMs. We also\npropose a QSI-aware Simultaneous Iterative Water-filling Algorithm (QSIWFA) and\nshow that it can achieve the Nash Equilibrium (NE)."

    "summary": "To attain the best learning accuracy, people move on with difficulties and\nfrustrations. Though one can optimize the empirical objective using a given set\nof samples, its generalization ability to the entire sample distribution\nremains questionable. Even if a fair generalization guarantee is offered, one\nstill wants to know what is to happen if the regularizer is removed, and/or how\nwell the artificial loss (like the hinge loss) relates to the accuracy.\n  For such reason, this report surveys four different trials towards the\nlearning accuracy, embracing the major advances in supervised learning theory\nin the past four years. Starting from the generic setting of learning, the\nfirst two trials introduce the best optimization and generalization bounds for\nconvex learning, and the third trial gets rid of the regularizer. As an\ninnovative attempt, the fourth trial studies the optimization when the\nobjective is exactly the accuracy, in the special case of binary\nclassification. This report also analyzes the last trial through experiments."

The competition\nprovided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to\ndiscover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games,\nmore accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating\nsystem, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating\nsystem. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the\noutcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of\nthe players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that\navoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is\nrelatively small and one has to be careful not to draw \"too many conclusions\"\nout of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs\nof such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a\nvery good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the\nprivate hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the\nnumber of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the\nopponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for\ntraining the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage\nand regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation."

In this\npaper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much\nattention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the\nmessages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization\nstrategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence.

    "summary": "We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand\ninventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a\nPoisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by\nthe retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement\nintensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is\nnot known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action\n\"on the fly\" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed\ndemand reactions.\n  Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic\n\"learning-while-doing\" algorithm that only involves function value estimation\nto achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of\nshrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval\nusing a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate\nof our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of\nasymptotic \"regret\" (the relative loss comparing to the full information\noptimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric\nand non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a\ncustomer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is\nthat the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand\nfunction as well as each customer's exact reservation price are less important\nthan prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be\nbetter off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than\nsequentially."

    "summary": "This article presents a model which is capable of learning and abstracting\nnew concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance\nbetween the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with\nthe templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the\nfirst stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description\nwhich is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is\ninspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next,\nthe new observations are identified through comparing them with the\npreviously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The\ncomparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance.\nThe new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm\nconsecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the\nobjects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed\ncategories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing\ntemplates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This\ndescription is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a\ndimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template\nbears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that\ndimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new\nobservation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the\nexperiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the\nnew polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible\nthrough employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual\nsystem. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation\nresults of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new\ntemplates."

To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and\nsuccessfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the\nelastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to\nselect correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel\nBayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to\nguide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional\nclassification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in\na principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the\neigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of\nits MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet\nfrom a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive\neigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the\n$l_{1/2}$ regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the\nelastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially\nwhen the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables."

    "summary": "Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with\nordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for\nordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due\nto the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of\nordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to\nobtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater\nabundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of\nunlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for\nordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR).\nThe key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both\nthe ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the\nordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include\nan objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions\ncasted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label\nswapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective\nfunction value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used\nbenchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are\nthen presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed\ntransductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent\nstate-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced\ntransductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and\nimproved performance."

    "summary": "We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel\nBelief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are\nrepresented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and\nmessage updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS. KBP makes none of the\nassumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need\nnot arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their\nrelations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between\nvariables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from\ntraining data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where\nkernels are defined (Rd, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric\nmodels are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not\nexist. The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the\ntraining data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update\nprocedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In\nexperiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still\nimages, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing\nclassical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases),\nwhile providing significantly more accurate results."

    "summary": "The classical perceptron rule provides a varying upper bound on the maximum\nmargin, namely the length of the current weight vector divided by the total\nnumber of updates up to that time. Requiring that the perceptron updates its\ninternal state whenever the normalized margin of a pattern is found not to\nexceed a certain fraction of this dynamic upper bound we construct a new\napproximate maximum margin classifier called the perceptron with dynamic margin\n(PDM). We demonstrate that PDM converges in a finite number of steps and derive\nan upper bound on them. We also compare experimentally PDM with other\nperceptron-like algorithms and support vector machines on hard margin tasks\ninvolving linear kernels which are equivalent to 2-norm soft margin."

A typical application is \\emph{shape fitting}, where we\nwish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from\na (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\\in P$\ncorresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$,\nand we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in\n$P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and\n$f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.\n  Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\\em coresets} and\n{\\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our\nresults, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of\n$\\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension,\nto the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are\nsome kind of \"compressed representation\" of the input set $F$. Using\ntraditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time\napproximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be\ncomputed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only\npolylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).\n  We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances\n(as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic\nconstructions."

The proposed sensing policy\nguides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those\nfrequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy\nis based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and\nspatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic\nmodeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time.\nEnergy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per\neach subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important\nto control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary\ntransmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary\nuser. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy\nimproves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the\nenergy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability."

We develop a new method, based on convex optimization,\nto do so in the case when the number of latent variables is smaller than the\nnumber of observed ones.

This learning algorithm will present the computer to look at the\ninternal and external environment in series of independent entities, which will\ninteract with each other, with and/or without knowledge of the computer's\nbrain. When a learning algorithm interacts, it does so by detecting and\nunderstanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with\nthis approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the\nthird party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other.\nThese unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make\nan effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour\nof the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and\nunsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning\nalgorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to\nevaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in\nsimulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as\ndreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated\nby the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are\nuseful in finding \"hidden\" entities, which may be known or unknown. However,\nthis model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear\nor unknown. IBSEAD is better because it considers three types of entities-\nknown, unknown and invisible. We present our case with a comparison of existing\nalgorithms in known environments and cases and present the results of the\nexperiments using dry run of the simulated runs of the existing machine\nlearning algorithms versus IBSEAD."

We build upon an existing\napproach to Automatic Network Reconstruction proposed by part of the authors.\nThis approach has firm mathematical foundations and is well suited for ASP due\nto its combinatorial flavor providing a characterization of all models\nexplaining a set of experiments. The usage of ASP has several ben- efits over\nthe existing heuristic algorithms. First, it is declarative and thus\ntransparent for biological experts. Second, it is elaboration tolerant and thus\nallows for an easy exploration and incorporation of biological constraints.\nThird, it allows for exploring the entire space of possible models. Finally,\nour approach offers an excellent performance, matching existing,\nspecial-purpose systems."

    "summary": "The analysis of physiological processes over time are often given by\nspectrometric or gene expression profiles over time with only few time points\nbut a large number of measured variables. The analysis of such temporal\nsequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The\ninformation can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression\ndifferences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time.\nAvailable methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The\npredictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or\npost-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of\nsamples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach,\ntermed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a\nsupervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We\nutilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and\nrelevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive\nover time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences\nand to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the\nidentification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes\ndimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly\nnoise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal\nsequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and\nmetric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for\nsynthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The\ndiscriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably\nwith the results of alternative methods. Our method permits the visualization\nof the data on a low dimensional grid, highlighting the observed temporal\nstructure."

We show that our framework\ncan be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side\nconstraints addressed in \\cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}. By turning the problem into an online\nconvex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which\nachieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ bound for the violation of constraints. Then we\nmodify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied\nin the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on\nthe Mirror Prox method \\citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational\ninequalities which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{\\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for\nboth regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\\K$ can be\ndescribed by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the\nresult to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set\n$\\mathcal{K}$ and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same\nbounds in expectation as our first algorithm."

    "summary": "Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their\ncomputational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology\nhas identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory\nbehaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data\nuseful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems\nhave been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the\ncomputational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is\nlargely unrepresented.\n  Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based\non the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify\ninformative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when\nembodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions\nto learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy\nyields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse\nstructures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general\ntasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how\nthe proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of\nbehavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how\nit might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior."

In addition to mapping the data into a space of lower\ndimensionality, our approach aims to preserve the nonnegative components of the\ndata that are important for classification. We identify these components from\nthe support vectors of large-margin classifiers and derive iterative updates to\npreserve them in a semi-supervised version of NMF. These updates have a simple\nmultiplicative form like their unsupervised counterparts; they are also\nguaranteed at each iteration to decrease their loss function---a weighted sum\nof I-divergences that captures the trade-off between unsupervised and\nsupervised learning. We evaluate these updates for dimensionality reduction\nwhen they are used as a precursor to linear classification. In this role, we\nfind that they yield much better performance than their unsupervised\ncounterparts. We also find one unexpected benefit of the low dimensional\nrepresentations discovered by our approach: often they yield more accurate\nclassifiers than both ordinary and transductive SVMs trained in the original\ninput space."

This approach makes use of a recently developed\nrepresentation of conditional distributions as functions in a reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space. Such representations bypass the need for estimating\ntransition probabilities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be\ndefined. Our approach avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals\nsince expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has\nlinear complexity in the sample size. Thus, we can efficiently perform value\nfunction estimation in a wide variety of settings, including finite state\nspaces, continuous states spaces, and partially observable tasks where only\nsensor measurements are available. A second advantage of the approach is that\nwe learn the conditional distribution representation from a training sample,\nand do not require an exhaustive exploration of the state space. We prove\nconvergence of our approach either to the optimal policy, or to the closest\nprojection of the optimal policy in our model class, under reasonable\nassumptions. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on\na learning task in a continuous state space (the under-actuated pendulum), and\non a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. We\ncompare with least-squares policy iteration where a Gaussian process is used\nfor value function estimation. Our algorithm achieves better performance in\nboth tasks."

To answer this, we train a 9-layered\nlocally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast\nnormalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lion\nconnections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from\nthe Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous\nSGD on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary\nto what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sults\nreveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label\nimages as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature\ndetector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane\nrotation.

    "summary": "Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning\nmanifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some\nsuccesses, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to\nnoise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which\nwe simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a\ndifferent view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning\nproblems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold\nalgorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each\nview allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way\nthat an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}\ndimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for\ntwo-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance\noperators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold\nproblems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can\naid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data."

For example, to return home from a conference, humans identify\nonly few subgoal states such as lobby, taxi, airport etc. Each valid behavior\nconnecting two such states can be viewed as an action, and there are trillions\nof them. Assuming the subgoal identification problem is already solved, the\nquality of any RL method---in real-world settings---depends less on how well it\nscales with the number of states than on how well it scales with the number of\nactions. This is where our new method T-Learning excels, by evaluating the\nrelatively few possible transits from one state to another in a\npolicy-independent way, rather than a huge number of state-action pairs, or\nstates in traditional policy-dependent ways.

Secondly, Mutual\nInformation is employed to construct the FWSVM by weighting different features\nbased on their degree of importance. Finally, since parameter selection plays a\nvital role in classification accuracy of SVMs, MCS is applied to select the\nbest parameter values.

    "summary": "In the current competitive world, industrial companies seek to manufacture\nproducts of higher quality which can be achieved by increasing reliability,\nmaintainability and thus the availability of products. On the other hand,\nimprovement in products lifecycle is necessary for achieving high reliability.\nTypically, maintenance activities are aimed to reduce failures of industrial\nmachinery and minimize the consequences of such failures. So the industrial\ncompanies try to improve their efficiency by using different fault detection\ntechniques. One strategy is to process and analyze previous generated data to\npredict future failures. The purpose of this paper is to detect wasted parts\nusing different data mining algorithms and compare the accuracy of these\nalgorithms. A combination of thermal and physical characteristics has been used\nand the algorithms were implemented on Ahanpishegan's current data to estimate\nthe availability of its produced parts.\n  Keywords: Data Mining, Fault Detection, Availability, Prediction Algorithms."

    "summary": "Clustering is considered a non-supervised learning setting, in which the goal\nis to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters. Often a\nbound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner.\nMany versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and\n$k$-median.\n  An underlying problem with the unsupervised nature of clustering it that of\ndetermining a similarity function. One approach for alleviating this difficulty\nis known as clustering with side information, alternatively, semi-supervised\nclustering. Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of\n\"must be clustered\" or \"must be separated\" labels for data point pairs. Each\nsuch piece of information comes at a \"query cost\" (often involving human\nresponse solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the\nusual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly\nadding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering\nobjective.\n  Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to\nchoose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably\nbetter than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show\nthat the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs\nincident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we\ndo not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the\nrecently introduced method of $\\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of\nAilon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both\nthe clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the\noptimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting\npairs uniformly."

We consider this problem\nunder a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function\nclass, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and\ncontext. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new\nalgorithm---Regressor Elimination--- with a regret similar to the agnostic\nsetting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower\nbound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case\neven with the realizability assumption.

The optimal policy is usually provided by an expert or teacher, making\nIRL specially suitable for the problem of apprenticeship learning. The task\ndescription is encoded in the form of a reward function of a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP). Several algorithms have been proposed to find the reward\nfunction corresponding to a set of demonstrations. One of the algorithms that\nhas provided best results in different applications is a gradient method to\noptimize a policy squared error criterion. On a parallel line of research,\nother authors have presented recently a gradient approximation of the maximum\nlikelihood estimate of the reward signal. In general, both approaches\napproximate the gradient estimate and the criteria at different stages to make\nthe algorithm tractable and efficient.

In the confusion-based learning framework we\npropose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of the\nconfusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm ||C||. We derive\ngeneralization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extended\nframework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss.\nPivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality that\ngeneralizes McDiarmid's inequality.

    "summary": "Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach to average over alternative\nmodels; yet, it usually gets excessively concentrated around the single most\nprobable model, therefore achieving only sub-optimal classification\nperformance. The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this\nproblem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic\nsmoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown\nexcellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers.\nAODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on\na collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic\npredictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs\nvia BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead,\nwe aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the\nresulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE.\nHowever, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the\narbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this\nproblem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the\nunique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize\nthe prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class\nvaries, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal\nclassifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single\nclass. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the\ncompression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the\nmodels by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers\nprovide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts;\nmoreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous\ncredal classifiers."

Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimax\nclassifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically proved\nthat, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can be\ntackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems and\nsub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a general\nframework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices is\nsuggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies."

The\nlearner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome,\nand then the learner receives a reward for the played action. The goal of the\nlearner is to maximize his total reward. However, there are situations in\nwhich, in addition to maximizing the cumulative reward, there are some\nadditional constraints on the sequence of decisions that must be satisfied on\naverage by the learner. In this paper we study an extension to the online\nlearning where the learner aims to maximize the total reward given that some\nadditional constraints need to be satisfied. By leveraging on the theory of\nLagrangian method in constrained optimization, we propose Lagrangian\nexponentially weighted average (LEWA) algorithm, which is a primal-dual variant\nof the well known exponentially weighted average algorithm, to efficiently\nsolve constrained online decision making problems. Using novel theoretical\nanalysis, we establish the regret and the violation of the constraint bounds in\nfull information and bandit feedback models."

It extends previous work by providing a\nrule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that\nour algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample\ncomplexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior\ndistribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite\nfavorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and\nillustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that\ngeneralizes across states."

There is a problem that the normalization term of\nthe NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and a\nstraightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain is\nfinite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NML\ncode-length for specific types of distributions.

Then we\nspecifically focus on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose a new efficient\nmethod for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen's\nre-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, in\nwhich a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is to\nestimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. We\ndemonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-based\nclustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data size\nrequired for high accuracy rate to be achieved."

    "summary": "In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how\nto perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong\nexploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The\nessence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other\nstate by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration\nalgorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited\nbefore. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems\nwould break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most\nphysical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we\naddress the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We\nfirst propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that\nimposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed\nsafe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed\nsafe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization\nformulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the\nguaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our\nframework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration\nmethods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a\nMartian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore\nbetter than classical exploration methods."

    "summary": "This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policy\nreinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its\nper-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights.\nPrevious work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting\nand does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient\ntemporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable\na target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another\n(behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more\npractical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly\nrepresent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a\nlarge action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the\ngenerality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility\nin action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental,\nlinear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces,\nprove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms,\nand empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on\nstandard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems."

This approach makes use of a recently developed representation of\nconditional distributions as \\emph{embeddings} in a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace (RKHS). Such representations bypass the need for estimating transition\nprobabilities or densities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be\ndefined. This avoids the need to calculate intractable integrals, since\nexpectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has\nlinear complexity in the number of points used to represent the embedding. We\nprovide guarantees for the proposed applications in MDPs: in the context of a\nvalue iteration algorithm, we prove convergence to either the optimal policy,\nor to the closest projection of the optimal policy in our model class (an\nRKHS), under reasonable assumptions. In experiments, we investigate a learning\ntask in a typical classical control setting (the under-actuated pendulum), and\non a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed.

    "summary": "We propose a new learning method for heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA),\nin which the data from the source domain and the target domain are represented\nby heterogeneous features with different dimensions. Using two different\nprojection matrices, we first transform the data from two domains into a common\nsubspace in order to measure the similarity between the data from two domains.\nWe then propose two new feature mapping functions to augment the transformed\ndata with their original features and zeros. The existing learning methods\n(e.g., SVM and SVR) can be readily incorporated with our newly proposed\naugmented feature representations to effectively utilize the data from both\ndomains for HDA. Using the hinge loss function in SVM as an example, we\nintroduce the detailed objective function in our method called Heterogeneous\nFeature Augmentation (HFA) for a linear case and also describe its\nkernelization in order to efficiently cope with the data with very high\ndimensions. Moreover, we also develop an alternating optimization algorithm to\neffectively solve the nontrivial optimization problem in our HFA method.\nComprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that\nHFA outperforms the existing HDA methods."

    "summary": "Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs) have been successfully used to learn\nnew representations for domain adaptation. Recently, they have attained record\naccuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different\ntext domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction,\nrecovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with\nnoise. In this paper, we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two\ncrucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to\nhigh-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs, our approach of mSDA\nmarginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or\nother optimization algorithms to learn parameters ? in fact, they are computed\nin closed-form. Consequently, mSDA, which can be implemented in only 20 lines\nof MATLAB^{TM}, significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude.\nFurthermore, the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the\ntraditional SDAs, attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks."

In practice\ninaccurate class distribution for each entity is often available from another\n(external) classifier. For example this distribution could come from a\nclassifier built using content features or a simple dictionary. Given the\nrelational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two\ngraph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be\nsolved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a\nsubset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a\ntransductive setting. In the other setting the class distributions of all nodes\nare used to define the fitting function part of a graph regularized objective\nfunction. We define a generalized objective function that handles both the\nsettings. Methods like harmonic Gaussian field and local-global consistency\n(LGC) reported in the literature can be seen as special cases. We extend the\nLGC and weighted vote relational neighbor classification (WvRN) methods to\nsupport usage of external classifier information. We also propose an efficient\nleast squares regularization (LSR) based method and relate it to information\nregularization methods. All the methods are evaluated on several benchmark and\nreal world datasets.

    "summary": "Metric learning methods have been shown to perform well on different learning\ntasks. Many of them rely on target neighborhood relationships that are computed\nin the original feature space and remain fixed throughout learning. As a\nresult, the learned metric reflects the original neighborhood relations. We\npropose a novel formulation of the metric learning problem in which, in\naddition to the metric, the target neighborhood relations are also learned in a\ntwo-step iterative approach. The new formulation can be seen as a\ngeneralization of many existing metric learning methods. The formulation\nincludes a target neighbor assignment rule that assigns different numbers of\nneighbors to instances according to their quality; `high quality' instances get\nmore neighbors. We experiment with two of its instantiations that correspond to\nthe metric learning algorithms LMNN and MCML and compare it to other metric\nlearning methods on a number of datasets.

In the domain of swarm robotics for instance, the expert can hardly\ndesign a reward function or demonstrate the target behavior, forbidding the use\nof both standard RL and inverse reinforcement learning. Although with a limited\nexpertise, the human expert is still often able to emit preferences and rank\nthe agent demonstrations. Earlier work has presented an iterative\npreference-based RL framework: expert preferences are exploited to learn an\napproximate policy return, thus enabling the agent to achieve direct policy\nsearch. Iteratively, the agent selects a new candidate policy and demonstrates\nit; the expert ranks the new demonstration comparatively to the previous best\none; the expert's ranking feedback enables the agent to refine the approximate\npolicy return, and the process is iterated. In this paper, preference-based\nreinforcement learning is combined with active ranking in order to decrease the\nnumber of ranking queries to the expert needed to yield a satisfactory policy.\nExperiments on the mountain car and the cancer treatment testbeds witness that\na couple of dozen rankings enable to learn a competent policy."

Unlike\ntheir indirect control over MD, in this paper, we propose an alternative\nboosting algorithm termed Margin distribution Controlled Boosting (MCBoost)\nwhich directly controls the MD by introducing and optimizing a key adjustable\nmargin parameter. MCBoost's optimization implementation adopts the column\ngeneration technique to ensure fast convergence and small number of weak\nclassifiers involved in the final MCBooster. We empirically demonstrate: 1)\nAdaBoost is actually also a MD controlled algorithm and its iteration number\nacts as a parameter controlling the distribution and 2) the generalization\nperformance of MCBoost evaluated on UCI benchmark datasets is validated better\nthan those of AdaBoost, L2Boost, LPBoost, AdaBoost-CG and MDBoost."

There is a\npressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and\ndiscovering the underlying patterns.

Other clustering algorithms seek a\nrepresentative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like $k$-means\nidentifies a representative \"center\" for each cluster. Vector-field $k$-means,\non the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single\ntrajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise\nthat movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple\nvector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the\nclusters. We also show how vector-field $k$-means connects techniques for\nscalar field design on meshes and $k$-means clustering.\n  We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of\ntrajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field $k$-means can\nbe used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence\nof its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including\nhistorical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous\ncall records from a large phone company.

In this paper we propose a new learning paradigm in which our goal is\nto uncover the structures that underly the set of relevant features for a given\nlearning problem. We uncover two types of features sets, non-replaceable\nfeatures that contain important information about the target variable and\ncannot be replaced by other features, and functionally similar features sets\nthat can be used interchangeably in learned models, given the presence of the\nnon-replaceable features, with no change in the predictive performance. To do\nso we propose a new learning algorithm that learns a number of disjoint models\nusing a model disjointness regularization constraint together with a constraint\non the predictive agreement of the disjoint models. We explore the behavior of\nour approach on a number of high-dimensional datasets, and show that, as\nexpected by their construction, these satisfy a number of properties.

Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent\nof cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to\nlead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of\npost-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base\nclassifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as\npossible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC\nand the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing\nmethods. Our results suggest that a larger MAUC is also beneficial.\nInterestingly, simple calibration methods that convert the output matrix into\nposterior probabilities perform better than existing sophisticated post\nre-optimization methods."

We formulate the\nrecommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal\nprobability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be\npredicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is\ncomputationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the\nBP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each\nactive user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As\nopposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving\nthe recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the\nrecommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the\nrecommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a\ntraining period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),\nwe verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of\nthe users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to\nthe state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)\nand Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision\naccuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a\nnew promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability\nwhile providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems."

    "summary": "Boosting methods combine a set of moderately accurate weaklearners to form a\nhighly accurate predictor. Despite the practical importance of multi-class\nboosting, it has received far less attention than its binary counterpart. In\nthis work, we propose a fully-corrective multi-class boosting formulation which\ndirectly solves the multi-class problem without dividing it into multiple\nbinary classification problems. In contrast, most previous multi-class boosting\nalgorithms decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple binary boosting\nproblems. By explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the primal optimization\nproblem, we are able to construct a column generation-based fully-corrective\napproach to boosting which directly optimizes multi-class classification\nperformance. The new approach not only updates all weak learners' coefficients\nat every iteration, but does so in a manner flexible enough to accommodate\nvarious loss functions and regularizations. For example, it enables us to\nintroduce structural sparsity through mixed-norm regularization to promote\ngroup sparsity and feature sharing. Boosting with shared features is\nparticularly beneficial in complex prediction problems where features can be\nexpensive to compute. Our experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our\ndirect multi-class boosting generalizes as well as, or better than, a range of\ncompeting multi-class boosting methods. The end result is a highly effective\nand compact ensemble classifier which can be trained in a distributed fashion."

    "summary": "In many practical applications of supervised learning the task involves the\nprediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input variables.\nWhen the prediction targets are binary the task is called multi-label\nclassification, while when the targets are continuous the task is called\nmulti-target regression. In both tasks, target variables often exhibit\nstatistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive\naccuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label classification methods\naddress this challenge by building a separate model for each target on an\nexpanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input\nvariables. Despite the success of these methods in the multi-label\nclassification domain, their applicability and effectiveness in multi-target\nregression has not been studied until now. In this paper, we introduce two new\nmethods for multi-target regression, called Stacked Single-Target and Ensemble\nof Regressor Chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods\nof this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these methods\n- a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables between\ntraining and prediction - and develop extensions that use out-of-sample\nestimates of the target variables during training in order to tackle this\nproblem. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a\nlarge and diverse collection of datasets show that, when the discrepancy is\nappropriately mitigated, the proposed methods attain consistent improvements\nover the independent regressions baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble\nof Regression Chains perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art\nmethods including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a\nmulti-objective random forest approach."

    "summary": "In data mining applications, feature selection is an essential process since\nit reduces a model's complexity. The cost of obtaining the feature values must\nbe taken into consideration in many domains. In this paper, we study the\ncost-sensitive feature selection problem on numerical data with measurement\nerrors, test costs and misclassification costs. The major contributions of this\npaper are four-fold. First, a new data model is built to address test costs and\nmisclassification costs as well as error boundaries. Second, a covering-based\nrough set with measurement errors is constructed. Given a confidence interval,\nthe neighborhood is an ellipse in a two-dimension space, or an ellipsoidal in a\nthree-dimension space, etc. Third, a new cost-sensitive feature selection\nproblem is defined on this covering-based rough set. Fourth, both backtracking\nand heuristic algorithms are proposed to deal with this new problem. The\nalgorithms are tested on six UCI (University of California - Irvine) data sets.\nExperimental results show that (1) the pruning techniques of the backtracking\nalgorithm help reducing the number of operations significantly, and (2) the\nheuristic algorithm usually obtains optimal results.

    "summary": "Parsimony, including sparsity and low rank, has been shown to successfully\nmodel data in numerous machine learning and signal processing tasks.\nTraditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that\nminimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently\nsequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative\noptimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring\nreal-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation\nencountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion\nin discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the\nemphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric\nview of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic\nfixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We\nshow a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for\nstructured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of\nproximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact\nparsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard\noptimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to\nnaturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings.\nState-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems in\nimage and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to\nthe exact optimization algorithms."

An important extension in pattern\nanalysis is to consider more than two sets of variables. This problem can be\nexpressed as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), commonly\nreferred to Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA). This is a\nnon-convex problem and so greedy algorithms converge to local optima without\nany guarantees on global optimality. In this paper, we show that despite being\nhighly structured, finding the optimal solution is NP-Hard. This motivates our\nrelaxation of the QCQP to a semidefinite program (SDP). The SDP is convex, can\nbe solved reasonably efficiently and comes with both absolute and\noutput-sensitive approximation quality.

Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular\napproach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard\ninterior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with\n$D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems\nexhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is\n$D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can\npractically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the\npopular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of\nproblem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a\nsignificantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on\nthe Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much\nsimpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric\nlearning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is\n$O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach.\nExperiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to\nsignificantly larger problems.

The Fourier transform of a narrow-band signal, with a\ndiscontinuous amplitude and/or phase function, exhibits spectral and temporal\nspreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly\nmodeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying\namplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the\namplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their\ntime-derivatives are sparse). The proposed method is based on a convex\nvariational (optimization) approach wherein the total variation (TV) of the\namplitude functions are regularized subject to a perfect (or approximate)\nreconstruction constraint. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived\nbased on convex optimization techniques. The proposed technique can be used to\nperform band-pass filtering that is relatively insensitive to narrow-band\namplitude/phase jumps present in data, which normally pose a challenge (due to\ntransients, leakage, etc.). The method is illustrated using both synthetic\nsignals and human EEG data for the purpose of band-pass filtering and the\nestimation of phase synchrony indexes."

    "summary": "Multitask clustering tries to improve the clustering performance of multiple\ntasks simultaneously by taking their relationship into account. Most existing\nmultitask clustering algorithms fall into the type of generative clustering,\nand none are formulated as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we\npropose two convex Discriminative Multitask Clustering (DMTC) algorithms to\naddress the problems. Specifically, we first propose a Bayesian DMTC framework.\nThen, we propose two convex DMTC objectives within the framework. The first\none, which can be seen as a technical combination of the convex multitask\nfeature learning and the convex Multiclass Maximum Margin Clustering (M3C),\naims to learn a shared feature representation. The second one, which can be\nseen as a combination of the convex multitask relationship learning and M3C,\naims to learn the task relationship. The two objectives are solved in a uniform\nprocedure by the efficient cutting-plane algorithm. Experimental results on a\ntoy problem and two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithms."

    "summary": "One important classifier ensemble for multiclass classification problems is\nError-Correcting Output Codes (ECOCs). It bridges multiclass problems and\nbinary-class classifiers by decomposing multiclass problems to a serial\nbinary-class problems. In this paper, we present a heuristic ternary code,\nnamed Weight Optimization and Layered Clustering-based ECOC (WOLC-ECOC). It\nstarts with an arbitrary valid ECOC and iterates the following two steps until\nthe training risk converges. The first step, named Layered Clustering based\nECOC (LC-ECOC), constructs multiple strong classifiers on the most confusing\nbinary-class problem. The second step adds the new classifiers to ECOC by a\nnovel Optimized Weighted (OW) decoding algorithm, where the optimization\nproblem of the decoding is solved by the cutting plane algorithm. Technically,\nLC-ECOC makes the heuristic training process not blocked by some difficult\nbinary-class problem. OW decoding guarantees the non-increase of the training\nrisk for ensuring a small code length. Results on 14 UCI datasets and a music\ngenre classification problem demonstrate the effectiveness of WOLC-ECOC."

In\nmany real-world problems, such as rating or ranking items, there is no single\nbest target function during the runtime of the algorithm, instead the best\n(local) target function is drifting over time. We develop a novel last-step\nminmax optimal algorithm in context of a drift. We analyze the algorithm in the\nworst-case regret framework and show that it maintains an average loss close to\nthat of the best slowly changing sequence of linear functions, as long as the\ntotal of drift is sublinear. In some situations, our bound improves over\nexisting bounds, and additionally the algorithm suffers logarithmic regret when\nthere is no drift. We also build on the H_infinity filter and its bound, and\ndevelop and analyze a second algorithm for drifting setting. Synthetic\nsimulations demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms in a worst-case\nconstant drift setting."

    "summary": "Quorum sensing is a decentralized biological process, through which a\ncommunity of cells with no global awareness coordinate their functional\nbehaviors based solely on cell-medium interactions and local decisions. This\npaper draws inspirations from quorum sensing and colony competition to derive a\nnew algorithm for data clustering. The algorithm treats each data as a single\ncell, and uses knowledge of local connectivity to cluster cells into multiple\ncolonies simultaneously. It simulates auto-inducers secretion in quorum sensing\nto tune the influence radius for each cell. At the same time, sparsely\ndistributed core cells spread their influences to form colonies, and\ninteractions between colonies eventually determine each cell's identity. The\nalgorithm has the flexibility to analyze not only static but also time-varying\ndata, which surpasses the capacity of many existing algorithms. Its stability\nand convergence properties are established. The algorithm is tested on several\napplications, including both synthetic and real benchmarks data sets, alleles\nclustering, community detection, image segmentation. In particular, the\nalgorithm's distinctive capability to deal with time-varying data allows us to\nexperiment it on novel applications such as robotic swarms grouping and\nswitching model identification.

Several methods have been\ndeveloped where the performance measure retained richer information than the\nmere misclassification rate: misclassification costs, ROC-based information,\netc. Following this idea of dealing with alternate measures of performance, we\npropose to address imbalanced classification problems by using a new measure to\nbe optimized: the norm of the confusion matrix. Indeed, recent results show\nthat using the norm of the confusion matrix as an error measure can be quite\ninteresting due to the fine-grain informations contained in the matrix,\nespecially in the case of imbalanced classes. Our first contribution then\nconsists in showing that optimizing criterion based on the confusion matrix\ngives rise to a common background for cost-sensitive methods aimed at dealing\nwith imbalanced classes learning problems. As our second contribution, we\npropose an extension of a recent multi-class boosting method --- namely\nAdaBoost.MM --- to the imbalanced class problem, by greedily minimizing the\nempirical norm of the confusion matrix. A theoretical analysis of the\nproperties of the proposed method is presented, while experimental results\nillustrate the behavior of the algorithm and show the relevancy of the approach\ncompared to other methods."

Similarity\nsearches can therefore be performed faster in Hamming distance space. The\nelements of Hamming distance space are bit strings. On the other hand, the\narrangement of hyperplanes induce the transformation from the feature vectors\ninto feature bit strings. This transformation method is a type of\nlocality-sensitive hashing that has been attracting attention as a way of\nperforming approximate similarity searches at high speed. Supervised learning\nof hyperplane arrangements allows us to obtain a method that transforms them\ninto feature bit strings reflecting the information of labels applied to\nhigher-dimensional feature vectors. In this p aper, we propose a supervised\nlearning method for hyperplane arrangements in feature space that uses a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

    "summary": "Stochastic neurons and hard non-linearities can be useful for a number of\nreasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging\nproblem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the\ninput of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we \"back-propagate\"\nthrough these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing\napproaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different\nsettings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for\nstochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second\napproach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic\nneuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which\napproximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first\norder. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative\nnoise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth\napproach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic\noutput directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid\nargument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context\nwhere these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of {\\em\nconditional computation}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed\nrepresentation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large\nchunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this\ncase, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the\ntime. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce\nthe computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation\nwould be useful."

Our scheme\nconsists of multiple distributed local learners, that analyze different streams\nof data that are correlated to a common event that needs to be classified. Each\nlearner uses a local classifier to make a local prediction. The local\npredictions are then collected by each learner and combined using a weighted\nmajority rule to output the final prediction.

Importantly, the worst case misclassification\nprobability of our algorithm tends asymptotically to 0 if the misclassification\nprobability of the best static aggregation rule or the misclassification\nprobability of the best local classifier tend to 0. Then we extend our\nalgorithm to address challenges specific to the distributed implementation and\nwe prove new bounds that apply to these settings.

Existing\nsolutions to this problem assume many comparisons are provided to learn a high\nquality kernel. However, this can be considered unrealistic for many real-world\ntasks since relative assessments require human input, which is often costly or\ndifficult to obtain. Because of this, only a limited number of these\ncomparisons may be provided. In this work, we explore methods for aiding the\nprocess of learning a kernel with the help of auxiliary kernels built from more\neasily extractable information regarding the relationships among objects. We\npropose a new kernel learning approach in which the target kernel is defined as\na conic combination of auxiliary kernels and a kernel whose elements are\nlearned directly. We formulate a convex optimization to solve for this target\nkernel that adds only minor overhead to methods that use no auxiliary\ninformation. Empirical results show that in the presence of few training\nrelative comparisons, our method can learn kernels that generalize to more\nout-of-sample comparisons than methods that do not utilize auxiliary\ninformation, as well as similar methods that learn metrics over objects."

    "summary": "Most metric learning algorithms, as well as Fisher's Discriminant Analysis\n(FDA), optimize some cost function of different measures of within-and\nbetween-class distances. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and\nseveral Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms are based on the SVM large\nmargin theory. Recently, SVMs have been analyzed from SVM and metric learning,\nand to develop new algorithms that build on the strengths of each. Inspired by\nthe metric learning interpretation of SVM, we develop here a new\nmetric-learning based SVM framework in which we incorporate metric learning\nconcepts within SVM. We extend the optimization problem of SVM to include some\nmeasure of the within-class distance and along the way we develop a new\nwithin-class distance measure which is appropriate for SVM. In addition, we\nadopt the same approach for MKL and show that it can be also formulated as a\nMahalanobis metric learning problem. Our end result is a number of SVM/MKL\nalgorithms that incorporate metric learning concepts. We experiment with them\non a set of benchmark datasets and observe important predictive performance\nimprovements."

In the batch setting, it outperformed state-of-the-art first- and\nsecond-order optimization methods on various learning tasks. We propose a\nstochastic version of this bound majorization method as well as a low-rank\nmodification for high-dimensional data-sets. The resulting stochastic\nsecond-order method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (across variations\nand various tunings) both in terms of the number of iterations and computation\ntime till convergence while finding a better quality parameter setting. The\nproposed method bridges first- and second-order stochastic optimization methods\nby maintaining a computational complexity that is linear in the data dimension\nand while exploiting second order information about the pseudo-global curvature\nof the objective function (as opposed to the local curvature in the Hessian)."

    "summary": "Learning a distance metric from the given training samples plays a crucial\nrole in many machine learning tasks, and various models and optimization\nalgorithms have been proposed in the past decade. In this paper, we generalize\nseveral state-of-the-art metric learning methods, such as large margin nearest\nneighbor (LMNN) and information theoretic metric learning (ITML), into a kernel\nclassification framework. First, doublets and triplets are constructed from the\ntraining samples, and a family of degree-2 polynomial kernel functions are\nproposed for pairs of doublets or triplets. Then, a kernel classification\nframework is established, which can not only generalize many popular metric\nlearning methods such as LMNN and ITML, but also suggest new metric learning\nmethods, which can be efficiently implemented, interestingly, by using the\nstandard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Two novel metric learning\nmethods, namely doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM, are then developed under the\nproposed framework. Experimental results show that doublet-SVM and triplet-SVM\nachieve competitive classification accuracies with state-of-the-art metric\nlearning methods such as ITML and LMNN but with significantly less training\ntime."

    "summary": "With the increasing number of mobile Apps developed, they are now closely\nintegrated into daily life. In this paper, we develop a framework to predict\nmobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status\nof a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial\nprerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power\nmanagement of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover\ntwo kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of\nbuilt-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The\nIF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated\nas AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to\ndiscover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage\nbehaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature\nselection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the\ntraining data and select those features which need less length to describe the\ntraining data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the\nlog size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification\nmodel to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the\nproposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these\nfeatures, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of\ndimensionality when using the kNN classifier. We conduct a comprehensive\nexperimental study based on a real mobile App usage dataset. The results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the predictive\ncapability for App usage prediction."

    "summary": "Pattern recognition techniques have been employed in a myriad of industrial,\nmedical, commercial and academic applications. To tackle such a diversity of\ndata, many techniques have been devised. However, despite the long tradition of\npattern recognition research, there is no technique that yields the best\nclassification in all scenarios. Therefore, the consideration of as many as\npossible techniques presents itself as an fundamental practice in applications\naiming at high accuracy. Typical works comparing methods either emphasize the\nperformance of a given algorithm in validation tests or systematically compare\nvarious algorithms, assuming that the practical use of these methods is done by\nexperts. In many occasions, however, researchers have to deal with their\npractical classification tasks without an in-depth knowledge about the\nunderlying mechanisms behind parameters. Actually, the adequate choice of\nclassifiers and parameters alike in such practical circumstances constitutes a\nlong-standing problem and is the subject of the current paper. We carried out a\nstudy on the performance of nine well-known classifiers implemented by the Weka\nframework and compared the dependence of the accuracy with their configuration\nparameter configurations. The analysis of performance with default parameters\nrevealed that the k-nearest neighbors method exceeds by a large margin the\nother methods when high dimensional datasets are considered. When other\nconfiguration of parameters were allowed, we found that it is possible to\nimprove the quality of SVM in more than 20% even if parameters are set\nrandomly. Taken together, the investigation conducted in this paper suggests\nthat, apart from the SVM implementation, Weka's default configuration of\nparameters provides an performance close the one achieved with the optimal\nconfiguration."

In this paper, we propose and\nanalyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the\ndivision step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by\nclustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and\nefficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the\nsubproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM\nproblem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel\nclustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are\nused to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly\nas suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel\nDivide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction\nstrategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training\nspeed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype\ndataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in\nobtaining the exact SVM solution (to within $10^{-6}$ relative error) which\nachieves 96.15% prediction accuracy.

When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents' behaviors\nexpress key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory\n(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example different risk-preferences for gains\nand losses as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a\nrisk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human\nbehavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence.\nAs a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework we apply it\nto quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find, that the\nrisk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral\ndata and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses which is\nindeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured\nfMRI signals show a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with\nBOLD signal change in the ventral striatum.

    "summary": "The task of assigning label sequences to a set of observed sequences is\ncommon in computational linguistics. Several models for sequence labeling have\nbeen proposed over the last few years. Here, we focus on discriminative models\nfor sequence labeling. Many batch and online (updating model parameters after\nvisiting each example) learning algorithms have been proposed in the\nliterature. On large datasets, online algorithms are preferred as batch\nlearning methods are slow. These online algorithms were designed to solve\neither a primal or a dual problem. However, there has been no systematic\ncomparison of these algorithms in terms of their speed, generalization\nperformance (accuracy/likelihood) and their ability to achieve steady state\ngeneralization performance fast. With this aim, we compare different algorithms\nand make recommendations, useful for a practitioner. We conclude that the\nselection of an algorithm for sequence labeling depends on the evaluation\ncriterion used and its implementation simplicity."

    "summary": "Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a special type of the temporally deep network\nmodel, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the recurrent matrix is\ncarefully designed and both the recurrent and input matrices are fixed. An ESN\nuses the linearity of the activation function of the output units to simplify\nthe learning of the output matrix. In this paper, we devise a special technique\nthat take advantage of this linearity in the output units of an ESN, to learn\nthe input and recurrent matrices. This has not been done in earlier ESNs due to\ntheir well known difficulty in learning those matrices. Compared to the\ntechnique of BackPropagation Through Time (BPTT) in learning general RNNs, our\nproposed method exploits linearity of activation function in the output units\nto formulate the relationships amongst the various matrices in an RNN. These\nrelationships results in the gradient of the cost function having an analytical\nform and being more accurate. This would enable us to compute the gradients\ninstead of obtaining them by recursion as in BPTT. Experimental results on\nphone state classification show that learning one or both the input and\nrecurrent matrices in an ESN yields superior results compared to traditional\nESNs that do not learn these matrices, especially when longer time steps are\nused."

This allows us to\npropose a learning paradigm where users can write (or adapt) their operators,\naccording to the problem, data representation and the way the information\nshould be navigated. To achieve this goal, data instances, background\nknowledge, rules, programs and operators are all written in the same functional\nlanguage, Erlang. Since changing operators affect how the search space needs to\nbe explored, heuristics are learnt as a result of a decision process based on\nreinforcement learning where each action is defined as a choice of operator and\nrule. As a result, the architecture can be seen as a 'system for writing\nmachine learning systems' or to explore new operators where the policy reuse\n(as a kind of transfer learning) is allowed. States and actions are represented\nin a Q matrix which is actually a table, from which a supervised model is\nlearnt. This makes it possible to have a more flexible mapping between old and\nnew problems, since we work with an abstraction of rules and actions. We\ninclude some examples sharing reuse and the application of the system gErl to\nIQ problems. In order to evaluate gErl, we will test it against some structured\nproblems: a selection of IQ test tasks and some experiments on some structured\nprediction problems (list patterns)."

    "summary": "The covariate shift is a challenging problem in supervised learning that\nresults from the discrepancy between the training and test distributions. An\neffective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research\ncommunity is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In\nspecific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation\ntechniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although\nthese methods work well for regression problems, their performance on\nclassification problems is not satisfactory. This is due to a key observation\nthat these methods focus on matching the sample marginal distributions without\npaying attention to preserving the separation between classes in the reweighted\nspace. In this paper, we propose a novel method for Discriminative\nDensity-ratio (DDR) estimation that addresses the aforementioned problem and\naims at estimating the density-ratio of joint distributions in a class-wise\nmanner. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that alternates\nbetween estimating the class information for the test data and estimating new\ndensity ratio for each class. To incorporate the estimated class information of\nthe test data, a soft matching technique is proposed. In addition, we employ an\neffective criterion which adopts mutual information as an indicator to stop the\niterative procedure while resulting in a decision boundary that lies in a\nsparse region. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and robustness."

Some of them may even\nnot have an analytic expression for the unnormalized probability function and\nno tractable approximation. This makes it difficult to estimate the quality of\nthese models, once they have been trained, or to monitor their quality (e.g.\nfor early stopping) while training. A previously proposed method is based on\nconstructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability\nfunction from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a\nmore efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true\ntest log-likelihood, and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated\nsamples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor\nmixing.

This paper studies novelty detection in a new setting where the\ndata object is represented as a bag of instances and associated with multiple\nclass labels, referred to as multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning.\nContrary to the common assumption in MIML that each instance in a bag belongs\nto one of the known classes, in novelty detection, we focus on the scenario\nwhere bags may contain novel-class instances. The goal is to determine, for any\ngiven instance in a new bag, whether it belongs to a known class or a novel\nclass. Detecting novelty in the MIML setting captures many real-world phenomena\nand has many potential applications. For example, in a collection of tagged\nimages, the tag may only cover a subset of objects existing in the images.\nDiscovering an object whose class has not been previously tagged can be useful\nfor the purpose of soliciting a label for the new object class.

    "summary": "Let $f:\\{-1,1\\}^n$ be a polynomial with at most $s$ non-zero real\ncoefficients. We give an algorithm for exactly reconstructing f given random\nexamples from the uniform distribution on $\\{-1,1\\}^n$ that runs in time\npolynomial in $n$ and $2s$ and succeeds if the function satisfies the unique\nsign property: there is one output value which corresponds to a unique set of\nvalues of the participating parities. This sufficient condition is satisfied\nwhen every coefficient of f is perturbed by a small random noise, or satisfied\nwith high probability when s parity functions are chosen randomly or when all\nthe coefficients are positive. Learning sparse polynomials over the Boolean\ndomain in time polynomial in $n$ and $2s$ is considered notoriously hard in the\nworst-case. Our result shows that the problem is tractable for almost all\nsparse polynomials. Then, we show an application of this result to hypergraph\nsketching which is the problem of learning a sparse (both in the number of\nhyperedges and the size of the hyperedges) hypergraph from uniformly drawn\nrandom cuts. We also provide experimental results on a real world dataset."

    "summary": "Recently there has been much work on selective sampling, an online active\nlearning setting, in which algorithms work in rounds. On each round an\nalgorithm receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether\nto query a label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is\ndiscarded. Most of this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is\nassumed that there is a fixed target model, and the performance of the\nalgorithm is compared to a fixed model. However, in many real-world\napplications, such as spam prediction, the best target function may drift over\ntime, or have shifts from time to time. We develop a novel selective sampling\nalgorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under no assumptions on the\nmechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive new mistake bounds\nthat depend on the amount of drift in the problem. Simulations on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms as a\nselective sampling algorithm in the drifting setting."

    "summary": "The goal of machine learning is to develop predictors that generalize well to\ntest data. Ideally, this is achieved by training on an almost infinitely large\ntraining data set that captures all variations in the data distribution. In\npractical learning settings, however, we do not have infinite data and our\npredictors may overfit. Overfitting may be combatted, for example, by adding a\nregularizer to the training objective or by defining a prior over the model\nparameters and performing Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a\nthird, alternative approach to combat overfitting: we extend the training set\nwith infinitely many artificial training examples that are obtained by\ncorrupting the original training data. We show that this approach is practical\nand efficient for a range of predictors and corruption models. Our approach,\ncalled marginalized corrupted features (MCF), trains robust predictors by\nminimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corruption model.\nWe show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be\ntrained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are\nalso more robust to feature deletion at test time."

Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant\nfeature subset that can facilitate classification or pattern detection.\nTraditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to\nguide the identification of relevant feature subsets. In this paper, however,\nwe consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label\ninformation, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant\nfeatures due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the\nintrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection\n(GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian\nregularized least squares regression model. With $\\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can\nfind a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds.\nExtensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two\ncomputational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior\nperformance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature\nselection methods.

    "summary": "This work presents a sound probabilistic method for enforcing adherence of\nthe marginal probabilities of a multi-label model to automatically discovered\ndeterministic relationships among labels. In particular we focus on discovering\ntwo kinds of relationships among the labels. The first one concerns pairwise\npositive entailement: pairs of labels, where the presence of one implies the\npresence of the other in all instances of a dataset. The second concerns\nexclusion: sets of labels that do not coexist in the same instances of the\ndataset. These relationships are represented with a Bayesian network. Marginal\nprobabilities are entered as soft evidence in the network and adjusted through\nprobabilistic inference. Our approach offers robust improvements in mean\naverage precision compared to the standard binary relavance approach across all\n12 datasets involved in our experiments. The discovery process helps\ninteresting implicit knowledge to emerge, which could be useful in itself."

    "summary": "Consider a Machine Learning Service Provider (MLSP) designed to rapidly\ncreate highly accurate learners for a never-ending stream of new tasks. The\nchallenge is to produce task-specific learners that can be trained from few\nlabeled samples, even if tasks are not uniquely identified, and the number of\ntasks and input dimensionality are large. In this paper, we argue that the MLSP\nshould exploit knowledge from previous tasks to build a good representation of\nthe environment it is in, and more precisely, that useful representations for\nsuch a service are ones that minimize generalization error for a new hypothesis\ntrained on a new task. We formalize this intuition with a novel method that\nminimizes an empirical proxy of the intra-task small-sample generalization\nerror. We present several empirical results showing state-of-the art\nperformance on single-task transfer, multitask learning, and the full lifelong\nlearning problem."

This paper\npresents dropout training for linear SVMs. To deal with the intractable\nexpectation of the non-smooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we\ndevelop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring\ndata augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the\nexpectation of a re-weighted least square problem, where the re-weights have\nclosed-form solutions. The similar ideas are applied to develop a new IRLS\nalgorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions. Our\nalgorithms offer insights on the connection and difference between the hinge\nloss and logistic loss in dropout training.

    "summary": "Machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict agent behaviors in\nreal-world dynamic systems, such as advertiser behaviors in sponsored search\nand worker behaviors in crowdsourcing. The behavior data in these systems are\ngenerated by live agents: once the systems change due to the adoption of the\nprediction models learnt from the behavior data, agents will observe and\nrespond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. As a\nresult, the behavior data will evolve and will not be identically and\nindependently distributed, posing great challenges to the theoretical analysis\non the machine learning algorithms for behavior prediction. To tackle this\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments\n(MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of\nthe machine learning algorithms on its basis. Since the one-step transition\nprobability matrix of MCRE depends on both previous states and the random\nenvironment, conventional techniques for generalization analysis cannot be\ndirectly applied. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique that\ntransforms the original MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov\nchain. The new Markov chain involves more variables but is more regular, and\nthus easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when\ntime approaches infinity. Then we prove a generalization bound for the machine\nlearning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain,\nwhich depends on both the Markovian parameters and the covering number of the\nfunction class compounded by the loss function for behavior prediction and the\nbehavior prediction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex\nprocesses in real-world dynamic systems."

    "summary": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used statistical models for modeling\nsequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an\nimportant learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation\nare based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer\nfrom high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence\nof spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of\nmoments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade\nand Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012\n(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic\ndata, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral\nmethods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method\napplying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a\nmuch more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the\nalgorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability\nissues are encountered in this regime.

    "summary": "Training deep directed graphical models with many hidden variables and\nperforming inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep\nbelief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed\nto train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the\ndirected generative model but also a conditional generative model (the\ninference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the\nposterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel\ninterpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better\nestimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables\nmultiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance\nsampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference\nnetwork as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed\nexperimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this\nreweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that\na sigmoidal belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the\ninference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior\ndistribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more\npowerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative\nmodels."

This contribution introduces a novel approximation scheme, namely\nthe Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework, that exhibits the following\nfeatures: sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity\nhandling and uncertainty management. A first KTD-based algorithm is provided\nfor deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased\nestimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD\nframework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed\nfor special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions.

In this paper, we are interested in RBM with the hierarchical\nprior over classes. We assume parameters for nearby nodes are correlated in the\nhierarchical tree, and further the parameters at each node of the tree be\northogonal to those at its ancestors. We propose a hierarchical correlated RBM\nfor classification problem, which generalizes the classification RBM with\nsharing information among different classes. In order to reduce the redundancy\nbetween node parameters in the hierarchy, we also introduce orthogonal\nrestrictions to our objective function.

In contrast,\nmaximum likelihood estimates may get trapped in local optima due to the\nnon-convex nature of the likelihood function of latent variable models. In this\npaper, we do an empirical evaluation of spectral learning (SL) and expectation\nmaximization (EM), which reveals an important gap between the theory and the\npractice. First, SL often leads to negative probabilities. Second, EM often\nyields better estimates than spectral learning and it does not seem to get\nstuck in local optima. We discuss how the rank of the model parameters and the\namount of training data can yield negative probabilities. We also question the\ncommon belief that maximum likelihood estimators are necessarily inconsistent."

To avoid optimizing over a fully linked\nmodel, gain-based or gradient-based feature selection methods start from an\nempty model and incrementally add top ranked features to it. However, for\nhigh-dimensional problems like statistical relational learning, training time\nof these incremental methods can be dominated by the cost of evaluating the\ngain or gradient of a large collection of candidate features. In this study we\npropose a fast feature evaluation algorithm called Contrastive Feature\nInduction (CFI), which only evaluates a subset of features that involve both\nvariables with high signals (deviation from mean) and variables with high\nerrors (residue). We prove that the gradient of candidate features can be\nrepresented solely as a function of signals and errors, and that CFI is an\nefficient approximation of gradient-based evaluation methods.

In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a\nrich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal\nregression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least\nabsolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions\nthat subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can\nbe fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as\nhappens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also\nderive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize\nexisting risk bounds for binary classification.

    "summary": "We propose a novel approach to sufficient dimension reduction in regression,\nbased on estimating contour directions of negligible variation for the response\nsurface. These directions span the orthogonal complement of the minimal space\nrelevant for the regression, and can be extracted according to a measure of the\nvariation in the response, leading to General Contour Regression(GCR). In\ncomparison to exiisting sufficient dimension reduction techniques, this\nsontour-based mothology guarantees exhaustive estimation of the central space\nunder ellipticity of the predictoor distribution and very mild additional\nassumptions, while maintaining vn-consisytency and somputational ease.\nMoreover, it proves to be robust to departures from ellipticity. We also\nestablish some useful population properties for GCR. Simulations to compare\nperformance with that of standard techniques such as ordinary least squares,\nsliced inverse regression, principal hessian directions, and sliced average\nvariance estimation confirm the advntages anticipated by theoretical analyses.\nWe also demonstrate the use of contour-based methods on a data set concerning\ngrades of students from Massachusetts colleges."

    "summary": "Vehicular sensor data consists of multiple time-series arising from a number\nof sensors. Using such multi-sensor data we would like to detect occurrences of\nspecific events that vehicles encounter, e.g., corresponding to particular\nmaneuvers that a vehicle makes or conditions that it encounters. Events are\ncharacterized by similar waveform patterns re-appearing within one or more\nsensors. Further such patterns can be of variable duration. In this work, we\npropose a method for detecting such events in time-series data using a novel\nfeature descriptor motivated by similar ideas in image processing. We define\nthe shape histogram: a constant dimension descriptor that nevertheless captures\npatterns of variable duration. We demonstrate the efficacy of using shape\nhistograms as features to detect events in an SVM-based, multi-sensor,\nsupervised learning scenario, i.e., multiple time-series are used to detect an\nevent. We present results on real-life vehicular sensor data and show that our\ntechnique performs better than available pattern detection implementations on\nour data, and that it can also be used to combine features from multiple\nsensors resulting in better accuracy than using any single sensor. Since\nprevious work on pattern detection in time-series has been in the single series\ncontext, we also present results using our technique on multiple standard\ntime-series datasets and show that it is the most versatile in terms of how it\nranks compared to other published results."

    "summary": "Traditionally, Multi-task Learning (MTL) models optimize the average of\ntask-related objective functions, which is an intuitive approach and which we\nwill be referring to as Average MTL. However, a more general framework,\nreferred to as Conic MTL, can be formulated by considering conic combinations\nof the objective functions instead; in this framework, Average MTL arises as a\nspecial case, when all combination coefficients equal 1. Although the advantage\nof Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works,\nno theoretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we\nderive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that\nthe tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination\ncoefficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice,\nand it is important to consider Conic MTL. As a byproduct of the generalization\nbound, it also theoretically explains the good experimental results of previous\nrelevant works. Finally, we propose a new Conic MTL model, whose conic\ncombination coefficients minimize the generalization bound, instead of choosing\nthem heuristically as has been done in previous methods. The rationale and\nadvantage of our model is demonstrated and verified via a series of experiments\nby comparing with several other methods."

A key task in this setting is Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), in which the servers would like to compute a low dimensional\nsubspace capturing as much of the variance of the union of their point sets as\npossible. Given a procedure for approximate PCA, one can use it to\napproximately solve $\\ell_2$-error fitting problems such as $k$-means\nclustering and subspace clustering. The essential properties of an approximate\ndistributed PCA algorithm are its communication cost and computational\nefficiency for a given desired accuracy in downstream applications. We give new\nalgorithms and analyses for distributed PCA which lead to improved\ncommunication and computational costs for $k$-means clustering and related\nproblems. Our empirical study on real world data shows a speedup of orders of\nmagnitude, preserving communication with only a negligible degradation in\nsolution quality. Some of these techniques we develop, such as a general\ntransformation from a constant success probability subspace embedding to a high\nsuccess probability subspace embedding with a dimension and sparsity\nindependent of the success probability, may be of independent interest."

    "summary": "Although multi-label learning can deal with many problems with label\nambiguity, it does not fit some real applications well where the overall\ndistribution of the importance of the labels matters. This paper proposes a\nnovel learning paradigm named \\emph{label distribution learning} (LDL) for such\nkind of applications. The label distribution covers a certain number of labels,\nrepresenting the degree to which each label describes the instance. LDL is a\nmore general learning framework which includes both single-label and\nmulti-label learning as its special cases. This paper proposes six working LDL\nalgorithms in three ways: problem transformation, algorithm adaptation, and\nspecialized algorithm design. In order to compare the performance of the LDL\nalgorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via\na clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are\ncollected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial\nand fifteen real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized\nalgorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the\ncharacteristics of the LDL problem."

    "summary": "In this paper, we study the generalization performance of regularized\nmulti-task learning (RMTL) in a vector-valued framework, where MTL is\nconsidered as a learning process for vector-valued functions. We are mainly\nconcerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL\nperform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what\nconditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task\nduring simultaneous learning?\n  In particular, we investigate two types of task-group relatedness: the\nobserved discrepancy-dependence measure (ODDM) and the empirical\ndiscrepancy-dependence measure (EDDM), both of which detect the dependence\nbetween two groups of multiple related tasks (MRTs). We then introduce the\nCartesian product-based uniform entropy number (CPUEN) to measure the\ncomplexities of vector-valued function classes. By applying the specific\ndeviation and the symmetrization inequalities to the vector-valued framework,\nwe obtain the generalization bound for RMTL, which is the upper bound of the\njoint probability of the event that there is at least one task with a large\nempirical discrepancy between the expected and empirical risks. Finally, we\npresent a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in the\nsimultaneous learning process, and we discuss how task relatedness affects the\ngeneralization performance of RMTL. Our theoretical findings answer the\naforementioned two questions."

Training SSVMs, however, is\ncomputationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured\nprediction subroutine (called \\emph{max-oracle}), which has to solve an\noptimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.\n  In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for SSVM training that is more\nefficient than earlier techniques when the max-oracle is computationally\nexpensive, as it is frequently the case in computer vision tasks. The main idea\nis to (i) combine the recent stochastic Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm\nwith efficient hyperplane caching, and (ii) use an automatic selection rule for\ndeciding whether to call the exact max-oracle or to rely on an approximate one\nbased on the cached hyperplanes.\n  We show experimentally that this strategy leads to faster convergence to the\noptimum with respect to the number of requires oracle calls, and that this\ntranslates into faster convergence with respect to the total runtime when the\nmax-oracle is slow compared to the other steps of the algorithm.\n  A publicly available C++ implementation is provided at\nhttp://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/papers/SVM.html ."

    "summary": "In this paper, the Dempster-Shafer method is employed as the theoretical\nbasis for creating data classification systems. Testing is carried out using\nthree popular (multiple attribute) benchmark datasets that have two, three and\nfour classes. In each case, a subset of the available data is used for training\nto establish thresholds, limits or likelihoods of class membership for each\nattribute, and hence create mass functions that establish probability of class\nmembership for each attribute of the test data. Classification of each data\nitem is achieved by combination of these probabilities via Dempster's Rule of\nCombination. Results for the first two datasets show extremely high\nclassification accuracy that is competitive with other popular methods. The\nthird dataset is non-numerical and difficult to classify, but good results can\nbe achieved provided the system and mass functions are designed carefully and\nthe right attributes are chosen for combination. In all cases the\nDempster-Shafer method provides comparable performance to other more popular\nalgorithms, but the overhead of generating accurate mass functions increases\nthe complexity with the addition of new attributes. Overall, the results\nsuggest that the D-S approach provides a suitable framework for the design of\nclassification systems and that automating the mass function design and\ncalculation would increase the viability of the algorithm for complex\nclassification problems."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose the problem of domain transfer structured output\nlearn- ing and the first solution to solve it. The problem is defined on two\ndifferent data domains sharing the same input and output spaces, named as\nsource domain and target domain. The outputs are structured, and for the data\nsamples of the source domain, the corresponding outputs are available, while\nfor most data samples of the target domain, the corresponding outputs are\nmissing. The input distributions of the two domains are significantly\ndifferent. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict\nthe structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs\navailable for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly\nlearn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the\noutput information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target\ndomain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source\ndomain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a\ndelta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor. An algorithm is\ndeveloped to learn the parameter of the delta function to minimize loss\nfunctions associat- ed with the predicted outputs against the true outputs of\nthe data samples with available outputs of the target domain."

Occupancy and activity are two important aspects, which need to be\ncorrectly estimated for optimal HVAC control. However, state-of-the-art methods\nto estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or\nwearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost.\nEncouragingly, with the advancement of the smartphones, these are becoming more\nachievable. Most of the existing occupancy estimation tech- niques have the\nunderlying assumption that the phone is always carried by its user. However,\nphones are often left at desk while attending meeting or other events, which\ngenerates estimation error for the existing phone based occupancy algorithms.\nSimilarly, in the recent days the emerging theory of Sparse Random Classifier\n(SRC) has been applied for activity classification on smartphone, however,\nthere are rooms to improve the on-phone process- ing. We propose a novel sensor\nfusion method which offers almost 100% accuracy for occupancy estimation.

    "summary": "A particularly successful role for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is as a\ntool for discovering useful relational features for subsequent use in a\npredictive model. Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational\nfeatures rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery\nof which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically,\nthere are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting\nany existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially\nimprove the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward\nenough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the\nspace of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in\nprinciple, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been\nconfined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we\naddress this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in\na distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each\nof which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and\nthen builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in\nwhich neighboring nodes share information to update local models. For a\ncategory of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown that the\nalgorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In\npractice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results\non synthetic and real datasets that suggests that in relatively short time the\n\"best\" node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is\ncomparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a\nnon-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights\nconverge first)."

A relative comparison specifies, for a data point\ntriplet $(x_i,x_j,x_k)$, that instance $x_i$ is more similar to $x_j$ than to\n$x_k$. Such constraints, when available, have been shown to be useful toward\ndefining appropriate distance metrics. In real-world applications, acquiring\nconstraints often require considerable human effort. This motivates us to study\nhow to select and query the most useful relative comparisons to achieve\neffective metric learning with minimum user effort. Given an underlying class\nconcept that is employed by the user to provide such constraints, we present an\ninformation-theoretic criterion that selects the triplet whose answer leads to\nthe highest expected gain in information about the classes of a set of\nexamples. Directly applying the proposed criterion requires examining $O(n^3)$\ntriplets with $n$ instances, which is prohibitive even for datasets of moderate\nsize. We show that a randomized selection strategy can be used to reduce the\nselection pool from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, allowing us to scale up to larger-size\nproblems.

    "summary": "With the availability of high precision digital sensors and cheap storage\nmedium, it is not uncommon to find large amounts of data collected on almost\nall measurable attributes, both in nature and man-made habitats. Weather in\nparticular has been an area of keen interest for researchers to develop more\naccurate and reliable prediction models. This paper presents a set of\nexperiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to\nbuild models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that\nparticular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability\nacross four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}. The\nresults provide a comparison of accuracy of these machine learning techniques\nand their reliability to predict the day of the week by analysing the weather\ndata. We then apply the models to predict weather conditions based on the\navailable data."

    "summary": "We consider the approximation capability of orthogonal super greedy\nalgorithms (OSGA) and its applications in supervised learning. OSGA is\nconcerned with selecting more than one atoms in each iteration step, which, of\ncourse, greatly reduces the computational burden when compared with the\nconventional orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA). We prove that even for function\nclasses that are not the convex hull of the dictionary, OSGA does not degrade\nthe approximation capability of OGA provided the dictionary is incoherent.\nBased on this, we deduce a tight generalization error bound for OSGA learning.\nOur results show that in the realm of supervised learning, OSGA provides a\npossibility to further reduce the computational burden of OGA in the premise of\nmaintaining its prominent generalization capability."

We achieve anytime (or\ninterruptible) predictions by sequencing the computation of feature groups and\nreporting results using the computed features at interruption. We extend\nOrthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Forward Regression (FR) to learn the\nsequencing greedily under this group setting with costs. We theoretically\nguarantee that our algorithms achieve near-optimal linear predictions at each\nbudget when a feature group is chosen. With a novel analysis of OMP, we improve\nits theoretical bound to the same strength as that of FR. In addition, we\ndevelop a novel algorithm that consumes cost $4B$ to approximate the optimal\nperformance of \\textit{any} cost $B$, and prove that with cost less than $4B$,\nsuch an approximation is impossible. To our knowledge, these are the first\nanytime bounds at \\textit{all} budgets.

    "summary": "The traditional prototype based clustering methods, such as the well-known\nfuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm, usually need sufficient data to find a good\nclustering partition. If the available data is limited or scarce, most of the\nexisting prototype based clustering algorithms will no longer be effective.\nWhile the data for the current clustering task may be scarce, there is usually\nsome useful knowledge available in the related scenes/domains. In this study,\nthe concept of transfer learning is applied to prototype based fuzzy clustering\n(PFC). Specifically, the idea of leveraging knowledge from the source domain is\nexploited to develop a set of transfer prototype based fuzzy clustering (TPFC)\nalgorithms. Three prototype based fuzzy clustering algorithms, namely, FCM,\nfuzzy k-plane clustering (FKPC) and fuzzy subspace clustering (FSC), have been\nchosen to incorporate with knowledge leveraging mechanism to develop the\ncorresponding transfer clustering algorithms. Novel objective functions are\nproposed to integrate the knowledge of source domain with the data of target\ndomain for clustering in the target domain. The proposed algorithms have been\nvalidated on different synthetic and real-world datasets and the results\ndemonstrate their effectiveness when compared with both the original prototype\nbased fuzzy clustering algorithms and the related clustering algorithms like\nmulti-task clustering and co-clustering."

    "summary": "Feature subset selection, as a special case of the general subset selection\nproblem, has been the topic of a considerable number of studies due to the\ngrowing importance of data-mining applications. In the feature subset selection\nproblem there are two main issues that need to be addressed: (i) Finding an\nappropriate measure function than can be fairly fast and robustly computed for\nhigh-dimensional data. (ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the\nsubset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information\nbetween features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two\nseries expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that\nmost heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated\napproximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole\nsubset space is an NP-hard problem. Here, instead of the conventional\nsequential search algorithms, we suggest a parallel search strategy based on\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) that can search through the subset space in\npolynomial time. By exploiting the similarities between the proposed algorithm\nand an instance of the maximum-cut problem in graph theory, the approximation\nratio of this algorithm is derived and is compared with the approximation ratio\nof the backward elimination method. The experiments show that it can be\nmisleading to judge the quality of a measure solely based on the classification\naccuracy, without taking the effect of the non-optimum search strategy into\naccount."

We argue that, with the\nlearned classifier, the uncertainty of the true class label of a data sample\nshould be reduced by knowing its classification response as much as possible.\nThe reduced uncertainty is measured by the mutual information between the\nclassification response and the true class label. To this end, when learning a\nlinear classifier, we propose to maximize the mutual information between\nclassification responses and true class labels of training samples, besides\nminimizing the classification error and reduc- ing the classifier complexity.\nAn objective function is constructed by modeling mutual information with\nentropy estimation, and it is optimized by a gradi- ent descend method in an\niterative algorithm. Experiments on two real world pattern classification\nproblems show the significant improvements achieved by maximum mutual\ninformation regularization."

    "summary": "In cognitive radio (CR) technology, the trend of sensing is no longer to only\ndetect the presence of active primary users. A large number of applications\ndemand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial,\ntemporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the\nstatistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network\n(BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing\nissue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community.\nBesides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to\nidentify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior\nknowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues\nsimultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting\nof an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable\nidentification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower\ncomputational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of\ndetermining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about\nvariables. With this result, cognitive users could efficiently understand the\nstatistical pattern of primary networks, such that more efficient cognitive\nprotocols could be designed across different network layers."

We consider the scenario where answers to\nsuch queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we\naim to discover via clustering. Different from most existing methods that only\nconsider constraints derived from yes and no answers, we also incorporate don't\nknow responses. We introduce a Discriminative Clustering method with Relative\nConstraints (DCRC) which assumes a natural probabilistic relationship between\ninstances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints.\nThe objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in\nthe meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use\nof the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints\ngenerated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from\na user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative\nconstraints, in particular when don't know answers are considered; 2) the\nimproved performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods that\nutilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our\nmethod in the presence of noisy constraints, such as those provided by human\njudgement."

We learn a kernel\nfrom relative comparisons via stochastic gradient descent, one query response\nat a time, by taking advantage of the sparse and low-rank properties of the\ngradient to efficiently restrict the kernel to lie in the space of positive\nsemidefinite matrices. In addition, we derive a passive-aggressive online\nupdate for minimally satisfying new relative comparisons as to not disrupt the\ninfluence of previously obtained comparisons.

This type of problems is raised in a\nvariety of applications, including monitoring of endangered species, cleaning,\nand surveillance. Particle filters are widely used to estimate target state\nfrom its prior information and its measurements that recently become available,\nespecially for the cases when the measurement model and the prior distribution\nof state of interest are non-Gaussian. However, the problem of estimating\nnumber of total targets and their state becomes intractable when the number of\ntotal targets and the measurement-target association are unknown. This paper\npresents a novel Gaussian particle filter technique that combines Kalman filter\nand particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based\non the measurement obtained online. The estimation is represented by a set of\nweighted particles, different from classical particle filter, where each\nparticle is a Gaussian distribution instead of a point mass."

    "summary": "Clustering is an essential problem in machine learning and data mining. One\nvital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the\ndata representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep\nlearning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of\nthe art performance in many classification problems, such as character\nrecognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little\nattention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised\nclustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with\nnonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages\nthe advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension\nreduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin\nframework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online\nefficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep\nbelief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer\nmodel complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the\nadvantage of our approach over competitive baselines."

To solve this problem, we\npropose to learn the class label predictors by maximizing the correntropy\nbetween the predicted labels and the true labels of the training samples, under\nthe regularized Maximum Correntropy Criteria (MCC) framework. Moreover, we\nregularize the predictor parameter to control the complexity of the predictor.\nThe learning problem is formulated by an objective function considering the\nparameter regularization and MCC simultaneously.

Inspired\nby the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive\nsemi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach.

We pretrain the\ndeep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer\ngreedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent.

The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to\nsudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging\ntechniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic\nactivity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging\nmethods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the\nrequired resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider\nthe clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk\nfactors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying\npatients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary\nangiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of\natherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm\noptimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other\nmachine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal\nstudy of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology\npowered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk\nfactor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known\nfactors.

When large-scale datasets are present,\ntypical approaches usually employed truncated kernel methods on the feature\nspace or DC approaches on the sample space.

Firstly, we divide the feature space into several subspaces using the\ndecomposition method proposed in this paper. Subsequently, these feature\nsubspaces are sent into individual local classifiers for training.

While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of\nintent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop\nculture, etc account for 50% of all search queries. This paper shows that the\nsignals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in\nintent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant. We\npresent a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to\nachieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions,\nunder certain assumptions. We provide strong evidence that this regret is close\nto the best achievable. Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate\nthat our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of\nintent-shifting traffic increases."

    "summary": "Supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge.\nSpecifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training\ndata, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data\ncorrectly. In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design\nthe learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done\nusually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory\nexplains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the\ncomplexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract\nand does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a\nclassifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations\nof the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize\nwell. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is\nequivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary\ndisplaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined\nradius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing\neach data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated\nas the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits\nthe fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We\ndevelop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the\nnoise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on\nthe noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative\nconsiderations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as\nSVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels\nand for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our\nframework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective\nfunctions."

We introduce both Optimistic\nQ(\\lambda) and the temporal second difference trace (TSDT). TSDT is\nparticularly powerful in deterministic domains. TSDT uses neither recency nor\nfrequency heuristics, storing (s,a,r,s',\\delta) so that off-policy updates can\nbe performed after apparently suboptimal actions have been taken. There are\nadditional advantages when using state abstraction, as in MAXQ. We demonstrate\nthat TSDT does significantly better than both Q-learning and Watkins'\nQ(\\lambda) in a deterministic cliff-walking domain. Results in a noisy\ncliff-walking domain are less advantageous for TSDT, but demonstrate the\nefficacy of Optimistic Q(\\lambda), a replacing trace with some of the\nadvantages of TSDT."

Traditional TD methods require commitment to finishing subtasks\nwithout exploration in order to update Q-values for early actions with high\nprobability. One-step intra-option learning and temporal second difference\ntraces (TSDT) do not suffer from this limitation.

    "summary": "Kernel density estimation, a.k.a. Parzen windows, is a popular density\nestimation method, which can be used for outlier detection or clustering. With\nmultivariate data, its performance is heavily reliant on the metric used within\nthe kernel. Most earlier work has focused on learning only the bandwidth of the\nkernel (i.e., a scalar multiplicative factor). In this paper, we propose to\nlearn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM)\nprocedure, which can be seen as an unsupervised counterpart to neighbourhood\ncomponent analysis (NCA). In order to avoid overfitting with a fully\nnonparametric density estimator in high dimensions, we also consider a\nsemi-parametric Gaussian-Parzen density model, where some of the variables are\nmodelled through a jointly Gaussian density, while others are modelled through\nParzen windows. For these two models, EM leads to simple closed-form updates\nbased on matrix inversions and eigenvalue decompositions. We show empirically\nthat our method leads to density estimators with higher test-likelihoods than\nnatural competing methods, and that the metrics may be used within most\nunsupervised learning techniques that rely on such metrics, such as spectral\nclustering or manifold learning methods. Finally, we present a stochastic\napproximation scheme which allows for the use of this method in a large-scale\nsetting."

One method of increasing the expressiveness of learned\nhypotheses in this context is to expand the feature set to include conjunctions\nof basic features. This can be done explicitly or where possible by using a\nkernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms,\nthe paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with\nwhich the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the\ngeneralization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first\ndescribe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of\nconjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to\nefficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially\nmany conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron\nalgorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when\nlearning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel\nfunctions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow\nalgorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions.\nKnown upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal\nForm (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However,\nwe prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnows behavior for\nlearning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions\nwhich correspond to running Winnow for this problem are not efficiently\ncomputable, and that there is no general construction that can run Winnow with\nkernels."

Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank\nprobabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users\nand items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and\nitems within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without\nprior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random\nobserved ratings (namely $O(N\\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can\npredict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a\nlocal vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide\nempirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling\nperformance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are\nperformed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We\ndevelop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users\ninto a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation.

However, this kind of\nrepresentation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more\ncomplex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are\nthe basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances\nbetween terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to\ndetermine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation\napplies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and\nthe possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical\nrepresentations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN\n(k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language\nrepresentation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to\ntake advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to\napply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat\ndata into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on\nintuitive associations between the names and values of variables and\nassociations based on attribute similarity.\n  Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and\nEstruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data,\nthese distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the\nexperiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor\nalgorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted\ndistance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can\nsignificantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat\nrepresentations."

    "summary": "Probabilistic generative modeling of data distributions can potentially\nexploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification.\nThis observation has motivated the development of approaches that couple\ngenerative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an\nunified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the\nmodel-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP\nclassifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear\nstochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the\nexplicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative\nprocedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the\nupdate rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is\nalways feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit\nform of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative\nmodels and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The\nderived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled\nmodels as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experiments\nshow that the coupling between data modeling generative model and the\ndiscriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this framework\nleads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance."

In the second\ncase, the biometric reference does not evolve quickly enough and also\nprogressively drifts from the real biometric data. We propose a hybrid system\nusing several biometric sub-references in order to increase per- formance of\nself-update systems by reducing the previously cited errors.

First, we provide a new kind of dataset in which users have typed both\nan imposed and a chosen pairs of logins and passwords. In addition, the\nkeystroke dynamics samples are collected in a web-based uncontrolled\nenvironment (OS, keyboards, browser, etc.). Such kind of dataset is important\nsince it provides us more realistic results of keystroke dynamics' performance\nin comparison to the literature (controlled environment, etc.). Second, we\npresent a statistical analysis of well known assertions such as the\nrelationship between performance and password size, impact of fusion schemes on\nsystem overall performance, and others such as the relationship between\nperformance and entropy.

We study the\nfollowing related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better\ndisentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains.\nConsequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of\nrepresentation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose\na secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space\nthey occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at\nhigher levels.

For the evaluation we applied our method to over 2,000 patient records\nfrom a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients\nwere diagnosed with cardiac disease. Our method was compared with latent\nsemantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant\nanalysis. The results were assessed using AUC, MCC, specificity, and\nsensitivity. Results indicate supervised Laplacian eigenmaps was the highest\nperforming method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC\nrespectively. SLE showed an increase in 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the\nbaseline which excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and\nMCC respectively over unsupervised Laplacian eigenmaps.

The algorithm, also known as Thompson\nSampling, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound\n(UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action\nspaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two\ntheoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior\nsampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds\ndeveloped for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior\nsampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for\nposterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model\nclasses. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder\ndimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards.\nCompared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes,\nour general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger\nthan the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis\nprovides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are\nhighlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing\nrecently proposed UCB algorithms."

    "summary": "In online learning the performance of an algorithm is typically compared to\nthe performance of a fixed function from some class, with a quantity called\nregret. Forster proposed a last-step min-max algorithm which was somewhat\nsimpler than the algorithm of Vovk, yet with the same regret. In fact the\nalgorithm he analyzed assumed that the choices of the adversary are bounded,\nyielding artificially only the two extreme cases. We fix this problem by\nweighing the examples in such a way that the min-max problem will be well\ndefined, and provide analysis with logarithmic regret that may have better\nmultiplicative factor than both bounds of Forster and Vovk. We also derive a\nnew bound that may be sub-logarithmic, as a recent bound of Orabona et.al, but\nmay have better multiplicative factor. Finally, we analyze the algorithm in a\nweak-type of non-stationary setting, and show a bound that is sub-linear if the\nnon-stationarity is sub-linear as well."

    "summary": "Recommender systems are emerging technologies that nowadays can be found in\nmany applications such as Amazon, Netflix, and so on. These systems help users\nto find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items.\nSlightly improvement of the accuracy of these recommenders can highly affect\nthe quality of recommendations. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in\nRecommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In\nthis paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization which adds general\nneighborhood information on the recommendation model. Users and items are\nclustered into different categories to see how these categories share\npreferences. We then employ these shared interests of categories in a fusion by\nBiased Matrix Factorization to achieve more accurate recommendations. This is a\ncomplement for the current neighborhood aware matrix factorization models which\nrely on using direct neighborhood information of users and items. The proposed\nmodel is tested on two well-known recommendation system datasets: Movielens100k\nand Netflix. Our experiment shows applying the general latent features of\ncategories into factorized recommender models improves the accuracy of\nrecommendations. The current neighborhood-aware models need a great number of\nneighbors to acheive good accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed model is better than or comparable with the current neighborhood-aware\nmodels when they consider fewer number of neighbors."

The high computational cost of DML arises from\nthe large number of variables to be determined and the constraint that a\ndistance metric has to be a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix. Although\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been successfully applied to improve the\nefficiency of DML, it can still be computationally expensive because in order\nto ensure that the solution is a PSD matrix, it has to, at every iteration,\nproject the updated distance metric onto the PSD cone, an expensive operation.\nWe address this challenge by developing two strategies within SGD, i.e.\nmini-batch and adaptive sampling, to effectively reduce the number of updates\n(i.e., projections onto the PSD cone) in SGD. We also develop hybrid approaches\nthat combine the strength of adaptive sampling with that of mini-batch online\nlearning techniques to further improve the computational efficiency of SGD for\nDML. We prove the theoretical guarantees for both adaptive sampling and\nmini-batch based approaches for DML. We also conduct an extensive empirical\nstudy to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for DML."

A unifying perspective on the design and the analysis of\nonline algorithms is provided by online mirror descent, a general prediction\nstrategy from which most first-order algorithms can be obtained as special\ncases. We generalize online mirror descent to time-varying regularizers with\ngeneric updates.

These views\nmay be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying\nto organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of\nmulti-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view\nlearning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1)\nco-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably,\nco-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement\non two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit\nkernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either\nlinearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning\nalgorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming\nthat the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is\nsignificant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve\nlearning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the\ncomplementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since\naccessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the\nexception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable\nto study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views.\nOverall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different\nviews, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has\nbetter generalization ability than single-view learning."

While, say, a regret of\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ is known, we argue that it important to ask what is the\nprovably optimal algorithm for this problem --- both because it leads to\nnatural algorithms, as well as because regret is in fact often comparable in\nmagnitude to the final payoffs and hence is a non-negligible term.\n  In the basic setting, the result essentially follows from a classical result\nof Cover from '65. Here instead, we focus on another standard setting, of\ntime-discounted payoffs, where the final \"stopping time\" is not specified. We\nexhibit an explicit characterization of the optimal regret for this setting.\n  To obtain our main result, we show that the optimal payoff functions have to\nsatisfy the Hermite differential equation, and hence are given by the solutions\nto this equation. It turns out that characterization of the payoff function is\nqualitatively different from the classical (non-discounted) setting, and,\nnamely, there's essentially a unique optimal solution."

    "summary": "In last few years there are major changes and evolution has been done on\nclassification of data. As the application area of technology is increases the\nsize of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because\nof unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become\ngreatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two\nclasses having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more\nfocusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying\nminority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very\nimportant. There are different methods available for classification of\nimbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic\napproach, data-preprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of\nthis technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper\nsystematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for\nresearch in class imbalance problem."

    "summary": "In the internet era there has been an explosion in the amount of digital text\ninformation available, leading to difficulties of scale for traditional\ninference algorithms for topic models. Recent advances in stochastic\nvariational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have\nmade it feasible to learn topic models on large-scale corpora, but these\nmethods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of\nthe model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian\ninference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the\nart method. We show connections between collapsed variational Bayesian\ninference and MAP estimation for LDA, and leverage these connections to prove\nconvergence properties of the proposed algorithm. In experiments on large-scale\ntext corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better\nsolution than the previous method. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated\nthat the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora,\nfacilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software."

    "summary": "We consider the problem of online combinatorial optimization under\nsemi-bandit feedback. The goal of the learner is to sequentially select its\nactions from a combinatorial decision set so as to minimize its cumulative\nloss. We propose a learning algorithm for this problem based on combining the\nFollow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method with a novel loss\nestimation procedure called Geometric Resampling (GR). Contrary to previous\nsolutions, the resulting algorithm can be efficiently implemented for any\ndecision set where efficient offline combinatorial optimization is possible at\nall. Assuming that the elements of the decision set can be described with\nd-dimensional binary vectors with at most m non-zero entries, we show that the\nexpected regret of our algorithm after T rounds is O(m sqrt(dT log d)). As a\nside result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in the full\ninformation setting to O(m^(3/2) sqrt(T log d)), gaining a factor of sqrt(d/m)\nover previous bounds for this algorithm."

    "summary": "Stochastic neurons can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning\nmodels, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the\ngradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic\nneurons, i.e., can we \"back-propagate\" through these stochastic neurons? We\nexamine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of\nsolutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated\nthat a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but\nnoisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron\nfiring probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small\nperturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this\nestimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is\nsmall. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very\ngeneral settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the\nestimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in\nreinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating\nthis unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a\nbiased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of\nthe gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of\nthe gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold,\nbut like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range. This is\nsimilar to traditional sigmoidal units but has the advantage that for many\ninputs, a hard decision (e.g., a 0 output) can be produced, which would be\nconvenient for conditional computation and achieving sparse representations and\nsparse gradients."

    "summary": "We present a novel approach for the construction of ensemble classifiers\nbased on dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods represent\ndatasets using a small number of attributes while preserving the information\nconveyed by the original dataset. The ensemble members are trained based on\ndimension-reduced versions of the training set. These versions are obtained by\napplying dimensionality reduction to the original training set using different\nvalues of the input parameters. This construction meets both the diversity and\naccuracy criteria which are required to construct an ensemble classifier where\nthe former criterion is obtained by the various input parameter values and the\nlatter is achieved due to the decorrelation and noise reduction properties of\ndimensionality reduction. In order to classify a test sample, it is first\nembedded into the dimension reduced space of each individual classifier by\nusing an out-of-sample extension algorithm. Each classifier is then applied to\nthe embedded sample and the classification is obtained via a voting scheme. We\npresent three variations of the proposed approach based on the Random\nProjections, the Diffusion Maps and the Random Subspaces dimensionality\nreduction algorithms. We also present a multi-strategy ensemble which combines\nAdaBoost and Diffusion Maps. A comparison is made with the Bagging, AdaBoost,\nRotation Forest ensemble classifiers and also with the base classifier which\ndoes not incorporate dimensionality reduction.

    "summary": "Recent work has shown how denoising and contractive autoencoders implicitly\ncapture the structure of the data-generating density, in the case where the\ncorruption noise is Gaussian, the reconstruction error is the squared error,\nand the data is continuous-valued. This has led to various proposals for\nsampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and\nMetropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the\ntraining procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of\nthe underlying data-generating distribution when the data are discrete, or\nusing other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another\nissue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of\nsmall corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem,\nwhich deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption,\narbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both\ndiscrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to\nnon-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."

However,\nthe trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not\nallow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently\nand can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene\ndata sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the\nparameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to\nall features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the\n0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly\nimproved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better\nclassification accuracy.

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks\n(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain\nwhose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition\ndistribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previous state,\ngenerally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer\ndominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier\nto learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like\nlearning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can\nbe obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the\nprobabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way\nan interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized\npseudolikelihood, along with a definition of an appropriate joint distribution\nand sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can\nbe used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables\ngiven the rest.

    "summary": "In multiclass semi-supervised learning (SSL), it is sometimes the case that\nthe number of classes present in the data is not known, and hence no labeled\nexamples are provided for some classes. In this paper we present variants of\nwell-known semi-supervised multiclass learning methods that are robust when the\ndata contains an unknown number of classes. In particular, we present an\n\"exploratory\" extension of expectation-maximization (EM) that explores\ndifferent numbers of classes while learning. \"Exploratory\" SSL greatly improves\nperformance on three datasets in terms of F1 on the classes with seed examples\ni.e., the classes which are expected to be in the data. Our Exploratory EM\nalgorithm also outperforms a SSL method based non-parametric Bayesian\nclustering."

    "summary": "This tutorial gives a concise overview of existing PAC-Bayesian theory\nfocusing on three generalization bounds. The first is an Occam bound which\nhandles rules with finite precision parameters and which states that\ngeneralization loss is near training loss when the number of bits needed to\nwrite the rule is small compared to the sample size. The second is a\nPAC-Bayesian bound providing a generalization guarantee for posterior\ndistributions rather than for individual rules. The PAC-Bayesian bound\nnaturally handles infinite precision rule parameters, $L_2$ regularization,\n{\\em provides a bound for dropout training}, and defines a natural notion of a\nsingle distinguished PAC-Bayesian posterior distribution. The third bound is a\ntraining-variance bound --- a kind of bias-variance analysis but with bias\nreplaced by expected training loss. The training-variance bound dominates the\nother bounds but is more difficult to interpret. It seems to suggest variance\nreduction methods such as bagging and may ultimately provide a more meaningful\nanalysis of dropouts."

    "summary": "The multi-label classification problem has generated significant interest in\nrecent years. However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key\nchallenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say\nmillions) of labels, and (b) the ability to handle data with missing labels. In\nthis paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label\nproblem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our\nframework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several\nrecent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of\nour method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the\nstructure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to\noffer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits\nformal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk\nbounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank\npromoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive)\nFrobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results\non a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform\nsignificantly better than existing label compression based methods and can\nscale up to very large datasets such as the Wikipedia dataset."

    "summary": "In this paper we study a generalized version of classical multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) problem by allowing for arbitrary constraints on constituent bandits at\neach decision point. The motivation of this study comes from many situations\nthat involve repeatedly making choices subject to arbitrary constraints in an\nuncertain environment: for instance, regularly deciding which advertisements to\ndisplay online in order to gain high click-through-rate without knowing user\npreferences, or what route to drive home each day under uncertain weather and\ntraffic conditions. Assume that there are $K$ unknown random variables (RVs),\ni.e., arms, each evolving as an \\emph{i.i.d} stochastic process over time. At\neach decision epoch, we select a strategy, i.e., a subset of RVs, subject to\narbitrary constraints on constituent RVs.\n  We then gain a reward that is a linear combination of observations on\nselected RVs.\n  The performance of prior results for this problem heavily depends on the\ndistribution of strategies generated by corresponding learning policy. For\nexample, if the reward-difference between the best and second best strategy\napproaches zero, prior result may lead to arbitrarily large regret.\n  Meanwhile, when there are exponential number of possible strategies at each\ndecision point, naive extension of a prior distribution-free policy would cause\npoor performance in terms of regret, computation and space complexity.\n  To this end, we propose an efficient Distribution-Free Learning (DFL) policy\nthat achieves zero regret, regardless of the probability distribution of the\nresultant strategies.\n  Our learning policy has both $O(K)$ time complexity and $O(K)$ space\ncomplexity. In successive generations, we show that even if finding the optimal\nstrategy at each decision point is NP-hard, our policy still allows for\napproximated solutions while retaining near zero-regret."

The major problem of their approach is its high\ncomputational complexity for training, which hampers its application on\nreal-world problems. In this work, we propose a scalable and simple stage-wise\nmulti-class boosting method, which also directly maximizes the multi-class\nmargin. Our approach of- fers a few advantages: 1) it is simple and\ncomputationally efficient to train. The approach can speed up the training time\nby more than two orders of magnitude without sacrificing the classification\naccuracy. 2) Like traditional AdaBoost, it is less sensitive to the choice of\nparameters and empirically demonstrates excellent generalization performance.\nExperimental results on challenging multi-class machine learning and vision\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves the\nconvergence rate and accuracy of the final visual detector at no additional\ncomputational cost compared to existing multi-class boosting."

    "summary": "In this work, we define cost-free learning (CFL) formally in comparison with\ncost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL\napproach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost\ninformation, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL\napproaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some\ncriteria-based pproaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing\nCFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications\nproperly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on\ninformation theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized\nmutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers.\nUsing the strategy, we can deal with binary/multi-class classifications\nwith/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new\nstrategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed\nstrategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and\nautomatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving\noptimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the\n\"equivalent\" costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection\nthresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on\nseveral benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The\nclassification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in\nmachine learning."

We apply a\nminimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to\ntwo unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly\naccording to some known distribution, and the other which allows the adversary\nfull control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted\nlosses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial\nhorizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the\nadversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known.\nBased on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a\nnew adaptive algorithm which \"pretends\" that the horizon is drawn from a\ndistribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is\nchosen, the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online\nconvex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm\nand first order bounds.

In addition, a model can also use users' historical\nbehaviors and credit history to group users. Each dataset contains different\ninformation and suffices for learning. A number of clustering algorithms on\nmultiple datasets were proposed during the past few years. These algorithms\nassume that at least one dataset is complete.

    "summary": "In many real-world tasks, particularly those involving data objects with\ncomplicated semantics such as images and texts, one object can be represented\nby multiple instances and simultaneously be associated with multiple labels.\nSuch tasks can be formulated as multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML)\nproblems, and have been extensively studied during the past few years. Existing\nMIML approaches have been found useful in many applications; however, most of\nthem can only handle moderate-sized data. To efficiently handle large data\nsets, in this paper we propose the MIMLfast approach, which first constructs a\nlow-dimensional subspace shared by all labels, and then trains label specific\nlinear models to optimize approximated ranking loss via stochastic gradient\ndescent. Although the MIML problem is complicated, MIMLfast is able to achieve\nexcellent performance by exploiting label relations with shared space and\ndiscovering sub-concepts for complicated labels. Experiments show that the\nperformance of MIMLfast is highly competitive to state-of-the-art techniques,\nwhereas its time cost is much less; particularly, on a data set with 20K bags\nand 180K instances, MIMLfast is more than 100 times faster than existing MIML\napproaches. On a larger data set where none of existing approaches can return\nresults in 24 hours, MIMLfast takes only 12 minutes.

These methods classify initially\nunlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph\nstarting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly\nwith the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node.\nUnfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with\nvery large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In\nthis paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which\ncompactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a\nrandomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under\nmild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m)\nto O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support\nour analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe\nthat MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art\ngraph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at\nthe same time achieving up to 10x speedup.

Though many papers were devoted to\nstudy incident classification algorithms, few study investigated how to enhance\nfeature representation of incidents to improve AID performance. In this paper,\nwe propose to use an unsupervised feature learning algorithm to generate higher\nlevel features to represent incidents. We used real incident data in the\nexperiments and found that effective feature mapping function can be learnt\nfrom the data crosses the test sites. With the enhanced features, detection\nrate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR) and mean time to detect (MTTD) are\nsignificantly improved in all of the three representative cases.

    "summary": "Scalable machine learning over big data is an important problem that is\nreceiving a lot of attention in recent years. On popular distributed\nenvironments such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines,\ncommunication costs are substantial and algorithms need to be designed suitably\nconsidering those costs. In this paper we give a novel approach to the\ndistributed training of linear classifiers (involving smooth losses and L2\nregularization) that is designed to reduce the total communication costs. At\neach iteration, the nodes minimize locally formed approximate objective\nfunctions; then the resulting minimizers are combined to form a descent\ndirection to move. Our approach gives a lot of freedom in the formation of the\napproximate objective function as well as in the choice of methods to solve\nthem. The method is shown to have $O(log(1/\\epsilon))$ time convergence. The\nmethod can be viewed as an iterative parameter mixing method. A special\ninstantiation yields a parallel stochastic gradient descent method with strong\nconvergence. When communication times between nodes are large, our method is\nmuch faster than the Terascale method (Agarwal et al., 2011), which is a state\nof the art distributed solver based on the statistical query model (Chuet al.,\n2006) that computes function and gradient values in a distributed fashion. We\nalso evaluate against other recent distributed methods and demonstrate superior\nperformance of our method."

    "summary": "Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation\nprocess. The explanation of the relationship between model variables and\noutputs is relatively easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions,\nthanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical\nsignificance. For \"black box\" models, such as random forest, this information\nis hidden inside the model structure. This work presents an approach for\ncomputing feature contributions for random forest classification models. It\nallows for the determination of the influence of each variable on the model\nprediction for an individual instance. By analysing feature contributions for a\ntraining dataset, the most significant variables can be determined and their\ntypical contribution towards predictions made for individual classes, i.e.,\nclass-specific feature contribution \"patterns\", are discovered. These patterns\nrepresent a standard behaviour of the model and allow for an additional\nassessment of the model reliability for a new data. Interpretation of feature\ncontributions for two UCI benchmark datasets shows the potential of the\nproposed methodology. The robustness of results is demonstrated through an\nextensive analysis of feature contributions calculated for a large number of\ngenerated random forest models."

Unfortunately,\nCombBand requires at each step an $n$-by-$n$ matrix permanent approximation to\nwithin improved accuracy as $T$ grows, resulting in a total running time that\nis super linear in $T$, making it impractical for large time horizons.\n  We provide an algorithm of regret $O(n^{3/2}\\sqrt{T})$ with total time\ncomplexity $O(n^3T)$. The ideas are a combination of CombBand and a recent\nalgorithm by Ailon (2013) for online optimization over the permutahedron in the\nfull information setting.

    "summary": "A key challenge in designing convolutional network models is sizing them\nappropriately. Many factors are involved in these decisions, including number\nof layers, feature maps, kernel sizes, etc. Complicating this further is the\nfact that each of these influence not only the numbers and dimensions of the\nactivation units, but also the total number of parameters. In this paper we\nfocus on assessing the independent contributions of three of these linked\nvariables: The numbers of layers, feature maps, and parameters. To accomplish\nthis, we employ a recursive convolutional network whose weights are tied\nbetween layers; this allows us to vary each of the three factors in a\ncontrolled setting. We find that while increasing the numbers of layers and\nparameters each have clear benefit, the number of feature maps (and hence\ndimensionality of the representation) appears ancillary, and finds most of its\nbenefit through the introduction of more weights. Our results (i) empirically\nconfirm the notion that adding layers alone increases computational power,\nwithin the context of convolutional layers, and (ii) suggest that precise\nsizing of convolutional feature map dimensions is itself of little concern;\nmore attention should be paid to the number of parameters in these layers\ninstead."

    "summary": "Policy Gradient methods that explore directly in parameter space are among\nthe most effective and robust direct policy search methods and have drawn a lot\nof attention lately. The basic method from this field, Policy Gradients with\nParameter-based Exploration, uses two samples that are symmetric around the\ncurrent hypothesis to circumvent misleading reward in \\emph{asymmetrical}\nreward distributed problems gathered with the usual baseline approach. The\nexploration parameters are still updated by a baseline approach - leaving the\nexploration prone to asymmetric reward distributions. In this paper we will\nshow how the exploration parameters can be sampled quasi symmetric despite\nhaving limited instead of free parameters for exploration. We give a\ntransformation approximation to get quasi symmetric samples with respect to the\nexploration without changing the overall sampling distribution. Finally we will\ndemonstrate that sampling symmetrically also for the exploration parameters is\nsuperior in needs of samples and robustness than the original sampling\napproach."

The goal is to explore\nalternative perspectives on the problem of deep network training. We evaluate\nFGA performance for deep SVMs on some experimental datasets, and show how\ngeneralisation and stability results may be derived for these models. We\ndescribe the effect of permutations on the model accuracy, and give a criterion\nfor the optimal permutation in terms of feature correlations. The experimental\nresults show that the algorithm produces robust and significant test set\nimprovements over a standard shallow SVM training method for a range of\ndatasets. These gains are achieved with a moderate increase in time complexity."

    "summary": "Mixtures of Experts combine the outputs of several \"expert\" networks, each of\nwhich specializes in a different part of the input space. This is achieved by\ntraining a \"gating\" network that maps each input to a distribution over the\nexperts. Such models show promise for building larger networks that are still\ncheap to compute at test time, and more parallelizable at training time. In\nthis this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep\nMixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This\nexponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each\ninput with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model\nsize. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the\nDeep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent\n(\"where\") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (\"what\") experts at\nthe second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in\nuse when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These\ndemonstrate effective use of all expert combinations."

First, its network\nstructure is novel: each layer of the network is a group of mutually\nindependent $k$-centers clusterings. Second, its learning method is extremely\nsimple: the $k$ centers of each clustering are only $k$ randomly selected\nexamples from the training data; for small-scale data sets, the $k$ centers are\nfurther randomly reconstructed by a simple cyclic-shift operation. Experimental\nresults on nonlinear dimensionality reduction show that the proposed method can\nlearn abstract representations on both large-scale and small-scale problems,\nand meanwhile is much faster than deep neural networks on large-scale problems."

    "summary": "Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions,\nparticularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging.\nThis paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio,\net. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating\nunits that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the\nweight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the\npre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using\nrectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden\nunit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as\nits value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural\nnetworks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results\nusing the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network\ndemonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to\nthe error introduced by the conditional computation process."

It not only gives us a description of how\nliving things evolve, but also shows how a population evolves through time and\nalso, why only the fittest individuals continue the generation forward. The\npaper basically gives a high level analysis of the works of Valiant[1]. Though,\nwe know the mechanisms of evolution, but it seems that there does not exist any\nstrong quantitative and mathematical theory of the evolution of certain\nmechanisms. What is defined exactly as the fitness of an individual, why is\nthat only certain individuals in a population tend to mutate, how computation\nis done in finite time when we have exponentially many examples: there seems to\nbe a lot of questions which need to be answered. [1] basically treats Darwinian\ntheory as a form of computational learning theory, which calculates the net\nfitness of the hypotheses and thus distinguishes functions and their classes\nwhich could be evolvable using polynomial amount of resources. Evolution is\nconsidered as a function of the environment and the previous evolutionary\nstages that chooses the best hypothesis using learning techniques that makes\nmutation possible and hence, gives a quantitative idea that why only the\nfittest individuals tend to survive and have the power to mutate."

Several machine learning techniques treat instances in a\ndata set differently during training such as curriculum learning, filtering,\nand boosting. However, an automated method for determining how beneficial an\ninstance is for inferring a model of the data does not exist. In this paper, we\npresent an automated method that orders the instances in a data set by\ncomplexity based on the their likelihood of being misclassified (instance\nhardness). The underlying assumption of this method is that instances with a\nhigh likelihood of being misclassified represent more complex concepts in a\ndata set. Ordering the instances in a data set allows a learning algorithm to\nfocus on the most beneficial instances and ignore the detrimental ones. We\ncompare ordering the instances in a data set in curriculum learning, filtering\nand boosting. We find that ordering the instances significantly increases\nclassification accuracy and that filtering has the largest impact on\nclassification accuracy. On a set of 52 data sets, ordering the instances\nincreases the average accuracy from 81% to 84%."

    "summary": "Several recent publications have proposed methods for mapping images into\ncontinuous semantic embedding spaces. In some cases the embedding space is\ntrained jointly with the image transformation. In other cases the semantic\nembedding space is established by an independent natural language processing\ntask, and then the image transformation into that space is learned in a second\nstage. Proponents of these image embedding systems have stressed their\nadvantages over the traditional \\nway{} classification framing of image\nunderstanding, particularly in terms of the promise for zero-shot learning --\nthe ability to correctly annotate images of previously unseen object\ncategories. In this paper, we propose a simple method for constructing an image\nembedding system from any existing \\nway{} image classifier and a semantic word\nembedding model, which contains the $\\n$ class labels in its vocabulary. Our\nmethod maps images into the semantic embedding space via convex combination of\nthe class label embedding vectors, and requires no additional training. We show\nthat this simple and direct method confers many of the advantages associated\nwith more complex image embedding schemes, and indeed outperforms state of the\nart methods on the ImageNet zero-shot learning task."

When applied to the MNIST and NORB datasets, we\nfind that this method achieves better classification results than denoising\nautoencoders, networks trained with dropout, and RBMs. k-sparse autoencoders\nare simple to train and the encoding stage is very fast, making them\nwell-suited to large problem sizes, where conventional sparse coding algorithms\ncannot be applied."

Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of\ninferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings\ndrawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular\nvalue decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records\nthe frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned\ndistribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and\non the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$. Existing concentration bounds\nseem to indicate that the concentration over $H_r$ gets looser with the size of\n$H_r$, suggesting to make a trade-off between the quantity of used information\nand the size of $H_r$. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for\nseveral variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds\nare tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds.

The time-series\nare projected to a new feature representation consisting of the sums of the\nmembership weights, which captures frequencies of local patterns. Features from\nvarious sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the\ninteraction of patterns from different sizes. Finally, a large-scale\nexperimental comparison against 6 state of the art baselines and 43 real life\ndatasets is conducted. The proposed method outperforms all the baselines with\nstatistically significant margins in terms of prediction accuracy."

Current efforts have been directed towards\neffective training of auto-encoder architectures with a large number of coding\nunits. Here, we propose a learning algorithm for auto-encoders based on a\nrate-distortion objective that minimizes the mutual information between the\ninputs and the outputs of the auto-encoder subject to a fidelity constraint.\nThe goal is to learn a representation that is minimally committed to the input\ndata, but that is rich enough to reconstruct the inputs up to certain level of\ndistortion. Minimizing the mutual information acts as a regularization term\nwhereas the fidelity constraint can be understood as a risk functional in the\nconventional statistical learning setting. The proposed algorithm uses a\nrecently introduced measure of entropy based on infinitely divisible matrices\nthat avoids the plug in estimation of densities. Experiments using\nover-complete bases show that the rate-distortion auto-encoders can learn a\nregularized input-output mapping in an implicit manner."

However, it may\nconverge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was\nrecently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to\nreturn an $\\epsilon$-approximation to the global minimum of $F$ in polynomial\ntime provided the maximum degree $\\Delta=O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of\nvariables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several\nresults including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of $F$,\nwhich leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any\ndegree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive)\nmodels, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the\nimportant result that approximating $\\log$ of the Bethe partition function,\n$\\log Z_B=-\\min F$, for a general model to additive $\\epsilon$-accuracy may be\nreduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to\npredicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the\nBethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge."

    "summary": "Multiple Kernel Learning(MKL) on Support Vector Machines(SVMs) has been a\npopular front of research in recent times due to its success in application\nproblems like Object Categorization. This success is due to the fact that MKL\nhas the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the\noptimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to\nselect the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels\npresented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by\nKloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of\nkernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not\nhave a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that\nstricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over\nthese techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to\nfine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we\npropose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can\nstrictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL\nformulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number\nof kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite\nand fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient\nDescent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to\nconverge. Through our experiments on the Caltech101 Object Categorization\ndataset, we have also shown that one can achieve better accuracies than the\nprevious formulations through the right choice of t."

Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain\nfor such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective. A\nfundamental aspect of music perception is that music is experienced in temporal\ncontext and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a novel\nreinforcement-learning framework for music recommendation that does not\nrecommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on\na model of preferences for both songs and song transitions. The model is\nlearned online and is uniquely adapted for each listener. To reduce exploration\ntime, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it subsequently\nupdates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with human participants\nusing both real song and playlist data. Our results indicate that DJ-MC's\nability to recommend sequences of songs provides a significant improvement over\nmore straightforward approaches, which do not take transitions into account."

    "summary": "Machine learning techniques are gaining prevalence in the production of a\nwide range of classifiers for complex real-world applications with nonuniform\ntesting and misclassification costs. The increasing complexity of these\napplications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and\nclassification. In this work we introduce ACT (anytime cost-sensitive tree\nlearner), a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. ACT is\nan anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for\nlower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional\ntime resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different\ncandidate splits. Using sampling techniques, ACT approximates the cost of the\nsubtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a\nstochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into\nwhich greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets\nwere conducted to compare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree\nlearners.

The regions produced by any\nConformal Predictor are automatically valid, however their tightness and\ntherefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each CP. In\neffect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is\ncompared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning\nalgorithm. We define six novel nonconformity measures based on the k-Nearest\nNeighbours Regression algorithm and develop the corresponding CPs following\nboth the original (transductive) and the inductive CP approaches.

    "summary": "An extreme learning machine (ELM) can be regarded as a two stage feed-forward\nneural network (FNN) learning system which randomly assigns the connections\nwith and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections\nwith output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially\na linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational\nburden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction\ndoes not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that\nwhether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical\nfeasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part\non this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation\nfunction, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation\nsense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show\nthat the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one\nhand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of\nELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically\njustify that there also exists an activation function such that the\ncorresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we\nprove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is\nessentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use\nof ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the\nwell-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the\ngeneralization capability.

    "summary": "Distributions over rankings are used to model data in a multitude of real\nworld settings such as preference analysis and political elections. Modeling\nsuch distributions presents several computational challenges, however, due to\nthe factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set. Some of these\nchallenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community, such as\nhow to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space,\nand how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these\nrepresentations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional\nchallenge of what we refer to as human task complexity users are rarely willing\nto provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often\npreferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing\nall of these challenges i.e., designing a compactly representable model which\nis amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking\ndata is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to\nproblems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently\nproposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each\nof the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical\nconnection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial\nrankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and\nexact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence\nbased represen- tations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also\nshows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models\n(in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial\nrankings. Finally, using our inference algorithm, we introduce the first method\nfor learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data."

Our first\ncontribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from\na supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown\nanomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on\nthe unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this\nrequirement.

    "summary": "A commonly used paradigm for representing graphs is to use a vector that\ncontains normalized frequencies of occurrence of certain motifs or sub-graphs.\nThis vector representation can be used in a variety of applications, such as,\nfor computing similarity between graphs. The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et\nal. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj\n[28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot\nproduct between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel\nbetween graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few\ndrawbacks. As k becomes larger we encounter the sparsity problem; most higher\norder graphlets will not occur in a given graph. This leads to diagonal\ndominance, that is, a given graph is similar to itself but not to any other\ngraph in the dataset. On the other hand, since lower order graphlets tend to be\nmore numerous, using lower values of k does not provide enough discrimination\nability. We propose a smoothing technique to tackle the above problems. Our\nmethod is based on a novel extension of Kneser-Ney and Pitman-Yor smoothing\ntechniques from natural language processing to graphs. We use the relationships\nbetween lower order and higher order graphlets in order to derive our method.\nConsequently, our smoothing algorithm not only respects the dependency between\nsub-graphs but also tackles the diagonal dominance problem by distributing the\nprobability mass across graphlets. In our experiments, the smoothed graphlet\nkernel outperforms graph kernels based on raw frequency counts."

Co-clustering is more advantageous over\ntraditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find\nhighly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the\noverlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract\nmeaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For\nexample, building predictive models with high dimensional data and\nheterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such\ndata, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more\naccurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding\npatient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in\nrecommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from\nco-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to\ngenerate co-clusters for improved data analysis.\n  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping\nCo-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and\nimproved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by\nmaximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on\nthe number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and\nf-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.\nResults of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques\n- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,\nInternet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set.

As the data\nvolume is increasing rapidly in the healthcare research, the analytical\nchallenge exists in double.

The SEER\npublic use cancer database provides various prominent class labels for\nprognosis prediction. The main objective of this paper is to find the effect of\nsampling techniques in classifying the prognosis variable and propose an ideal\nsampling method based on the outcome of the experimentation. In the first phase\nof this work the traditional random sampling and stratified sampling techniques\nhave been used. At the next level the balanced stratified sampling with\nvariations as per the choice of the prognosis class labels have been tested.\nMuch of the initial time has been focused on performing the pre_processing of\nthe SEER data set. The classification model for experimentation has been built\nusing the breast cancer, respiratory cancer and mixed cancer data sets with\nthree traditional classifiers namely Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest\nNeighbor. The three prognosis factors survival, stage and metastasis have been\nused as class labels for experimental comparisons.

We show that the $0-1$ loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and\nprobit loss satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex loss\nfunctions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large\nvalue of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and\nprobit loss can be made tolerant to non-uniform label noise also if we can\nassume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution.

    "summary": "This paper presents an approximate method for performing Bayesian inference\nin models with conditional independence over a decentralized network of\nlearning agents. The method first employs variational inference on each\nindividual learning agent to generate a local approximate posterior, the agents\ntransmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally\neach agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in\nthis work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes\ndestroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct\napplication of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed\nmethod addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the\ncombination procedure that accounts for these broken dependencies. Experiments\non synthetic and real data demonstrate that the decentralized method provides\nadvantages in computational performance and predictive test likelihood over\nprevious batch and distributed methods."

    "summary": "The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that for binary\nclassification problems, any Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learning rule\nhas close to optimal sample complexity. In this paper we seek for a generic\noptimal learner for multiclass prediction. We start by proving a surprising\nresult: a generic optimal multiclass learner must be improper, namely, it must\nhave the ability to output hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis\nclass, even though it knows that all the labels are generated by some\nhypothesis from the class. In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This\nbrings back the fundmamental question of \"how to learn\"? We give a complete\nanswer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion\nmulticlass learner of Rubinstein et al (2006) showing that its sample\ncomplexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular\nhypothesis class of generalized linear classifiers. We derive optimal learners\nthat, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally efficient.\nFurthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better\nthan the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open\nquestion due to Collins (2005)."

We consider the full and almost full cold\nstart problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in\nan out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them\nhas been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this\nproblem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature\nrepresentation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor\nproduct pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we\nintroduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the\nfields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that\nthe two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel\napproach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive\nperformance.

    "summary": "Distributed training of $l_1$ regularized classifiers has received great\nattention recently. Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps\nobtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is\ndecoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for\nmulticore and MPI platforms where communication costs are low. They are\ninefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity\nmachines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a\ndistributed algorithm for $l_1$ regularization that is much better suited for\nsuch systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to\nsupport these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is\nto do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function\nwithin each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that\nis matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer\niterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and\nGauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in\neach step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including\nQ-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our\nmethod to be much faster than existing methods."

In fact, we prove that OSLB is asymptotically\noptimal, as its asymptotic regret matches the lower bound. The regret analysis\nof our algorithms relies on a new concentration inequality for weighted sums of\nKL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards and their true\ndistributions. For continuous Lipschitz bandits, we propose to first discretize\nthe action space, and then apply OSLB or CKL-UCB, algorithms that provably\nexploit the structure efficiently.

In this paper, we provide detailed answers to all these questions\nusing the powerful framework of proximal operators.\n  The key idea that emerges is the use of primal dual spaces connected through\nthe use of a Legendre transform. This allows temporal difference updates to\noccur in dual spaces, allowing a variety of important technical advantages. The\nLegendre transform elegantly generalizes past algorithms for solving\nreinforcement learning problems, such as natural gradient methods, which we\nshow relate closely to the previously unconnected framework of mirror descent\nmethods. Equally importantly, proximal operator theory enables the systematic\ndevelopment of operator splitting methods that show how to safely and reliably\ndecompose complex products of gradients that occur in recent variants of\ngradient-based temporal difference learning. This key technical innovation\nmakes it possible to finally design \"true\" stochastic gradient methods for\nreinforcement learning.

    "summary": "Two types of low cost-per-iteration gradient descent methods have been\nextensively studied in parallel. One is online or stochastic gradient descent\n(OGD/SGD), and the other is randomzied coordinate descent (RBCD). In this\npaper, we combine the two types of methods together and propose online\nrandomized block coordinate descent (ORBCD). At each iteration, ORBCD only\ncomputes the partial gradient of one block coordinate of one mini-batch\nsamples. ORBCD is well suited for the composite minimization problem where one\nfunction is the average of the losses of a large number of samples and the\nother is a simple regularizer defined on high dimensional variables. We show\nthat the iteration complexity of ORBCD has the same order as OGD or SGD. For\nstrongly convex functions, by reducing the variance of stochastic gradients, we\nshow that ORBCD can converge at a geometric rate in expectation, matching the\nconvergence rate of SGD with variance reduction and RBCD."

    "summary": "Multi-label learning deals with the classification problems where each\ninstance can be assigned with multiple labels simultaneously. Conventional\nmulti-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations.\nIt is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for\ntraining instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in\nmany real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training\ninstances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the\nlabeler from the label set. This problem is especially typical when the number\ninstances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it\nalmost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study\nthe problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label\nassignments. We propose an approach, called MPU, based upon positive and\nunlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works,\nour method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label\ncorrelations simultaneously, and is very scalable, that has linear time\ncomplexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-world\nmulti-label datasets show that our MPU model consistently outperform other\ncommonly-used baselines."

This is not a new insight in ML and many methods for feature selection,\ntransformation, and construction have been developed. But while this is\non-going for general techniques for feature selection and transformation, i.e.\ndimensionality reduction, work on feature construction, i.e. enriching the\ndata, is by now mainly the domain of image, particularly character,\nrecognition, and NLP.\n  In this work, we propose a new general framework for feature construction.\nThe need for feature construction in a data set is indicated by class outliers\nand discriminative pattern mining used to derive features on their\nk-neighborhoods. We instantiate the framework with LOF and C4.5-Rules, and\nevaluate the usefulness of the derived features on a diverse collection of UCI\ndata sets. The derived features are more often useful than ones derived by\nDC-Fringe, and our approach is much less likely to overfit.

If either the reference policies are stateless rather than stateful,\nor the feedback includes the rewards of all actions (the so called \"expert\"\nsetting), previous work shows that the optimal regret grows like\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the number of decision rounds $T$.\n  The difficulty in our setting is that the decision maker unavoidably loses\ntrack of the internal states of the reference policies, and thus cannot\nreliably attribute rewards observed in a certain round to any of the reference\npolicies.

Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target\npropagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce\nthe reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many\nlevels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for\nback-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction\nthat is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction\nof higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also\nallow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder\ntakes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in\ninput, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target\ntowards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side\ninformation. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation\nin a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but\nlarger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long\nchain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good\nauto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by\ntransforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them,\nflattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical\njustifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with\nconjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or\nexperimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated\ntarget propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through\nmany non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations."

    "summary": "With advances in data collection technologies, tensor data is assuming\nincreasing prominence in many applications and the problem of supervised tensor\nlearning has emerged as a topic of critical significance in the data mining and\nmachine learning community. Conventional methods for supervised tensor learning\nmainly focus on learning kernels by flattening the tensor into vectors or\nmatrices, however structural information within the tensors will be lost. In\nthis paper, we introduce a new scheme to design structure-preserving kernels\nfor supervised tensor learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to leverage\nthe naturally available structure within the tensorial representation to encode\nprior knowledge in the kernel. We proposed a tensor kernel that can preserve\ntensor structures based upon dual-tensorial mapping. The dual-tensorial mapping\nfunction can map each tensor instance in the input space to another tensor in\nthe feature space while preserving the tensorial structure. Theoretically, our\napproach is an extension of the conventional kernels in the vector space to\ntensor space. We applied our novel kernel in conjunction with SVM to real-world\ntensor classification problems including brain fMRI classification for three\ndifferent diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and brain damage by HIV).\nExtensive empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approach can\neffectively boost tensor classification performances, particularly with small\nsample sizes."

In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms\ncontained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We\nfurther consider the extension in which more based arms could be\nprobabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms.\nThe reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it\nonly needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of\nnonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline\n(\\alpha,\\beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome\ndistributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\\beta}\ngenerates an {\\alpha} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of\nan online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize\n(\\alpha,\\beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the\n\\alpha{\\beta} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal\nsuper arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the\nalgorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n)\ndistribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we\nfurther provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward\nfunctions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1\nalgorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it\nsignificantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial\nbandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new\napplications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization,\nboth having nonlinear reward structures.

We also introduced new CRF models, CRF-BNCs and CRF-LCGs. They are CRF\nversions of Bayesian network classifiers and probabilistic left-corner grammars\nrespectively and easily implementable in D-PRISM. We empirically showed that\nthey outperform their generative counterparts as expected."

    "summary": "Sparse-Group Lasso (SGL) has been shown to be a powerful regression technique\nfor simultaneously discovering group and within-group sparse patterns by using\na combination of the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms. However, in large-scale\napplications, the complexity of the regularizers entails great computational\nchallenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Layer Feature REduction\nmethod (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The\ntwo-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the\ninactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the\nsparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing\nfeature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one\nsparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one\nthat is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers.\nMoreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with\nany existing solvers. We also develop a screening method---called DPC\n(DecomPosition of Convex set)---for the nonnegative Lasso problem. Experiments\non both synthetic and real data sets show that TLFre and DPC improve the\nefficiency of SGL and nonnegative Lasso by several orders of magnitude."

The method is popularly used and works well\nin practice despite the simplicity of the setting, but its statistical\nmechanism is not yet well-understood. In this paper we provide strong\ntheoretical guarantees regarding learning with random decision trees. We\nanalyze and compare three different variants of the algorithm that have minimal\nmemory requirements: majority voting, threshold averaging and probabilistic\naveraging. The random structure of the tree enables us to adapt these methods\nto a differentially-private setting thus we also propose differentially-private\nversions of all three schemes. We give upper-bounds on the generalization error\nand mathematically explain how the accuracy depends on the number of random\ndecision trees. Furthermore, we prove that only logarithmic (in the size of the\ndataset) number of independently selected random decision trees suffice to\ncorrectly classify most of the data, even when differential-privacy guarantees\nmust be maintained. We empirically show that majority voting and threshold\naveraging give the best accuracy, also for conservative users requiring high\nprivacy guarantees.

    "summary": "Feature selection involes identifying the most relevant subset of input\nfeatures, with a view to improving generalization of predictive models by\nreducing overfitting. Directly searching for the most relevant combination of\nattributes is NP-hard. Variable selection is of critical importance in many\napplications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number\nof discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease\nmechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The\nrecently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a\nhyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\\boldmath{$\\Theta$}) bound on its\nVC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good\ngeneralization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC\ndimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear\nclassifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it\nemploys. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a\nlarge number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones\nthat are chosen. Selected features are used to learn a kernel SVM classifier.\nOn a number of benchmark datasets, the features chosen by the linear MCM yield\ncomparable or better test set accuracy than when methods such as ReliefF and\nFCBF are used for the task. The linear MCM typically chooses one-tenth the\nnumber of attributes chosen by the other methods; on some very high dimensional\ndatasets, the MCM chooses about $0.6\\%$ of the features; in comparison, ReliefF\nand FCBF choose 70 to 140 times more features, thus demonstrating that\nminimizing the VC dimension may provide a new, and very effective route for\nfeature selection and for learning sparse representations."

However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained\nby playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence,\nin such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to\nenable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce\nand formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative\nthrough a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all\nthe arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm\nwith the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded\nparameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only\nfinitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the\noptimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability\none. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each\nother's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the\nparameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the\ninformativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk\nbound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for\nlinearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have\napplications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing."

One limitation with the existing\nalgorithms for CUR matrix decomposition is that they need an access to the {\\it\nfull} matrix, a requirement that can be difficult to fulfill in many real world\napplications. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR\ndecomposition algorithm for partially observed matrices. In particular, the\nproposed algorithm computes the low rank approximation of the target matrix\nbased on (i) the randomly sampled rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of\nobserved entries that are randomly sampled from the matrix. Our analysis shows\nthe relative error bound, measured by spectral norm, for the proposed algorithm\nwhen the target matrix is of full rank. We also show that only $O(n r\\ln r)$\nobserved entries are needed by the proposed algorithm to perfectly recover a\nrank $r$ matrix of size $n\\times n$, which improves the sample complexity of\nthe existing algorithms for matrix completion.

    "summary": "A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback\nfrom one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users. This results in\nan exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value\nhave to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing\napproaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items\nare small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if\ngood recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with\nunstructured content.\n  We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of\nitems and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph'\nconstrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that\nthe presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible --\nhowever this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage\nof the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in\nexploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of\nrecommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple\npolicies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.\n  From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study\nexploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and\n`strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the\nsame order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for\nthe worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon\nsettings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph.\nConversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly\nsub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal."

First, existing differentially private classifiers provide poor\naccuracy on real world datasets. Second, there is no known differentially\nprivate algorithm for empirically evaluating the private classifier on a\nprivate test dataset.\n  In this paper, we develop differentially private algorithms that mirror real\nworld empirical machine learning workflows. We consider the private classifier\ntraining algorithm as a blackbox. We present private algorithms for selecting\nfeatures that are input to the classifier. Though adding a preprocessing step\ntakes away some of the privacy budget from the actual classification process\n(thus potentially making it noisier and less accurate), we show that our novel\npreprocessing techniques significantly increase classifier accuracy on three\nreal-world datasets.

This suggests that linear loss functions\ntend to be the hardest ones to learn against, regardless of the underlying\ndecision spaces. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion looking\nat the interplay between the set of possible moves for both the decision maker\nand the adversarial environment. This allows us to highlight sharp distinctive\nbehaviors about the learnability of piecewise linear loss functions. On the one\nhand, when the decision set of the decision maker is a polyhedron, we establish\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on regret for a large class of piecewise linear\nloss functions with important applications in online linear optimization,\nrepeated zero-sum Stackelberg games, online prediction with side information,\nand online two-stage optimization. On the other hand, we exhibit $o(\\sqrt{T})$\nlearning rates, achieved by the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, in online linear\noptimization when the boundary of the decision maker's decision set is curved\nand when $0$ does not lie in the convex hull of the environment's decision set.\nHence, the curvature of the decision maker's decision set is a determining\nfactor for the optimal learning rate.

    "summary": "Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to dimensionality\nreduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering,\nbiology and social science. Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear\nprojections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature\nrepresentation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very\ndifficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is\nvulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse\nprincipal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature\nanalysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression\noptimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization\nis incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients\nsparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model\nused in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature,\nwhich in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output\nof our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under\nthe PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative\nalgorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and\nconduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets.

Among various clustering approaches, the family of\nk-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their\nsimplicity and efficacy. The classical k-means algorithm partitions a number of\ndata points into several subsets by iteratively updating the clustering centers\nand the associated data points. By contrast, a weighted undirected graph is\nconstructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph\ninto two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority\nof data points into a subset, which shall be avoided when the target dataset is\nbalanced. To achieve more accurate clustering for balanced dataset, we propose\nto leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance\ndegree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that\nbuild atop the exclusive lasso, we can make the clustering result as much\nbalanced as possible.

    "summary": "Matrix factorization is a popular approach for large-scale matrix completion.\nThe optimization formulation based on matrix factorization can be solved very\nefficiently by standard algorithms in practice. However, due to the\nnon-convexity caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical\nunderstanding of this formulation. In this paper, we establish a theoretical\nguarantee for the factorization formulation to correctly recover the underlying\nlow-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those\nin previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global\noptima of a factorization formulation, and recover the true low-rank matrix. We\nstudy the local geometry of a properly regularized factorization formulation\nand prove that any stationary point in a certain local region is globally\noptimal. A major difference of our work from the existing results is that we do\nnot need resampling in either the algorithm or its analysis. Compared to other\nworks on nonconvex optimization, one extra difficulty lies in analyzing\nnonconvex constrained optimization when the constraint (or the corresponding\nregularizer) is not \"consistent\" with the gradient direction. One technical\ncontribution is the perturbation analysis for non-symmetric matrix\nfactorization."

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully\ndecoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix\ntheory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical\nvalues of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are\nlocated in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number\nof local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the\nnetwork. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar\nbehavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies\nin real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge\nto the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there\nare local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a\nmajor difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter\npoor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered.\nFinally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the\nnetwork size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum\noften leads to overfitting."

    "summary": "The problem of automatically clustering data is an age old problem. People\nhave created numerous algorithms to tackle this problem. The execution time of\nany of this algorithm grows with the number of input points and the number of\ncluster centers required. To reduce the number of input points we could average\nthe points locally and use the means or the local centers as the input for\nclustering. However since the required number of local centers is very high,\nrunning the clustering algorithm on the entire dataset to obtain these\nrepresentational points is very time consuming. To remedy this problem, in this\npaper we are proposing two subclustering schemes where by we subdivide the\ndataset into smaller sets and run the clustering algorithm on the smaller\ndatasets to obtain the required number of datapoints to run our clustering\nalgorithm with. As we are subdividing the given dataset, we could run\nclustering algorithm on each smaller piece of the dataset in parallel. We found\nthat both parallel and serial execution of this method to be much faster than\nthe original clustering algorithm and error in running the clustering algorithm\non a reduced set to be very less."

Then, a threshold is tuned on a separate validation sample, by\ndirect optimization of AMS. We show that the regret of the resulting\n(thresholded) classifier measured with respect to the squared AMS, is\nupperbounded by the regret of the underlying real-valued function measured with\nrespect to the logistic loss.

Addressing learning from heterogeneous data in\nits full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead a\nmodel in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise\nlevel reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic\ngradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two\nconcrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local\ndifferential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy\nrequirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise\nimpacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise,\nthe order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We\npropose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the\nheterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in two cases of\ninterest.

In this paper, we propose a novel online multiple-output regression\nmethod, called MORES, for stream data. MORES can \\emph{dynamically} learn the\nstructure of the coefficients change in each update step to facilitate the\nmodel's continuous refinement. We observe that limited expressive ability of\nthe regression model, especially in the preliminary stage of online update,\noften leads to the variables in the residual errors being dependent. In light\nof this point, MORES intends to \\emph{dynamically} learn and leverage the\nstructure of the residual errors to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover,\nwe define three statistical variables to \\emph{exactly} represent all the seen\nsamples for \\emph{incrementally} calculating prediction loss in each online\nupdate round, which can avoid loading all the training data into memory for\nupdating model, and also effectively prevent drastic fluctuation of the model\nin the presence of noise. Furthermore, we introduce a forgetting factor to set\ndifferent weights on samples so as to track the data streams' evolving\ncharacteristics quickly from the latest samples. Experiments on one synthetic\ndataset and three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. In addition, the update speed of MORES is at least 2000\nsamples processed per second on the three real-world datasets, more than 15\ntimes faster than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithm."

The benefit of\nbatchwise optimization is that the non-zeros can be better allocated across the\nsamples, leading to a better approximation of the whole. To accomplish this, we\npropose procedures to switch non-zeros in both rows and columns in the support\nof the coefficient matrix to reduce the reconstruction error. We prove in the\nproposed support switching procedure the objective of the algorithm, i.e., the\nreconstruction error, decreases monotonically and converges. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a block orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that also operates on\nsample batches to provide a warm start.

    "summary": "In various applications involving hidden Markov models (HMMs), some of the\nhidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The\nminimality, identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been\nlong standing problems, with only partial solutions provided thus far. In this\npaper we focus on parametric-output HMMs, whose output distributions come from\na parametric family, and that have exactly two aliased states. For this class,\nwe present a complete characterization of their minimality and identifiability.\nFurthermore, for a large family of parametric output distributions, we derive\ncomputationally efficient and statistically consistent algorithms to detect the\npresence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition and emission\nparameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations."

    "summary": "We propose a new algorithm for minimizing regularized empirical loss:\nStochastic Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each\niteration we update a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike\nexisting methods such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of\nutilizing all curvature information contained in the examples, which leads to\nstriking improvements in both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of\nmagnitude. In the special case when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal,\nthe dual problem is a concave quadratic maximization problem plus a separable\nterm. In this regime, SDNA in each step solves a proximal subproblem involving\na random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the quadratic function; whence\nthe name of the method. If, in addition, the loss functions are quadratic, our\nmethod can be interpreted as a novel variant of the recently introduced\nIterative Hessian Sketch."

    "summary": "The minimization of the logistic loss is a popular approach to batch\nsupervised learning. Our paper starts from the surprising observation that,\nwhen fitting linear (or kernelized) classifiers, the minimization of the\nlogistic loss is \\textit{equivalent} to the minimization of an exponential\n\\textit{rado}-loss computed (i) over transformed data that we call Rademacher\nobservations (rados), and (ii) over the \\textit{same} classifier as the one of\nthe logistic loss. Thus, a classifier learnt from rados can be\n\\textit{directly} used to classify \\textit{observations}. We provide a learning\nalgorithm over rados with boosting-compliant convergence rates on the\n\\textit{logistic loss} (computed over examples). Experiments on domains with up\nto millions of examples, backed up by theoretical arguments, display that\nlearning over a small set of random rados can challenge the state of the art\nthat learns over the \\textit{complete} set of examples. We show that rados\ncomply with various privacy requirements that make them good candidates for\nmachine learning in a privacy framework. We give several algebraic, geometric\nand computational hardness results on reconstructing examples from rados. We\nalso show how it is possible to craft, and efficiently learn from, rados in a\ndifferential privacy framework. Tests reveal that learning from differentially\nprivate rados can compete with learning from random rados, and hence with batch\nlearning from examples, achieving non-trivial privacy vs accuracy tradeoffs."

    "summary": "Recent studies reveal that a deep neural network can learn transferable\nfeatures which generalize well to novel tasks for domain adaptation. However,\nas deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the\nnetwork, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with\nincreasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the\ndataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this\npaper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which\ngeneralizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation\nscenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are\nembedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of\ndifferent domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain\ndiscrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method\nfor mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with\nstatistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel\nembedding.

    "summary": "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the\ndistribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters\nof the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of\nthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training\nmini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image\nclassification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14\ntimes fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant\nmargin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the\nbest published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5\nvalidation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters."

Naively\nusing standard Mahalanobis metric learning methods under the Euclidean geometry\nfor SPD matrices is not appropriate, because the difference of SPD matrices can\nbe a non-SPD matrix and thus the obtained solution can be uninterpretable.

Few\ntheoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable\nleaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood\nheuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of\nre-submission.\n  In this work, we introduce a notion of \"leaderboard accuracy\" tailored to the\nformat of a competition.

In the course of our investigation we devise a method of\nclustering based on triangular potentials and we present associated theoretical\nresults as well as various examples based on synthetic data."

    "summary": "Supervised classification approaches can predict labels for unknown data\nbecause of the supervised training process. The success of classification is\nheavily dependent on the labeled training data. Differently, clustering is\neffective in revealing the aggregation property of unlabeled data, but the\nperformance of most clustering methods is limited by the absence of labeled\ndata. In real applications, however, it is time-consuming and sometimes\nimpossible to obtain labeled data. The combination of clustering and\nclassification is a promising and active approach which can largely improve the\nperformance. In this paper, we propose an innovative and effective clustering\nframework based on self-adaptive labeling (CSAL) which integrates clustering\nand classification on unlabeled data. Clustering is first employed to partition\ndata and a certain proportion of clustered data are selected by our proposed\nlabeling approach for training classifiers. In order to refine the trained\nclassifiers, an iterative process of Expectation-Maximization algorithm is\ndevised into the proposed clustering framework CSAL. Experiments are conducted\non publicly data sets to test different combinations of clustering algorithms\nand classification models as well as various training data labeling methods.\nThe experimental results show that our approach along with the self-adaptive\nmethod outperforms other methods."

    "summary": "In this paper we study the problem of learning from multiple modal data for\npurpose of document classification. In this problem, each document is composed\ntwo different modals of data, i.e., an image and a text. Cross-modal factor\nanalysis (CFA) has been proposed to project the two different modals of data to\na shared data space, so that the classification of a image or a text can be\nperformed directly in this space. A disadvantage of CFA is that it has ignored\nthe supervision information. In this paper, we improve CFA by incorporating the\nsupervision information to represent and classify both image and text modals of\ndocuments. We project both image and text data to a shared data space by factor\nanalysis, and then train a class label predictor in the shared space to use the\nclass label information. The factor analysis parameter and the predictor\nparameter are learned jointly by solving one single objective function. With\nthis objective function, we minimize the distance between the projections of\nimage and text of the same document, and the classification error of the\nprojection measured by hinge loss function. The objective function is optimized\nby an alternate optimization strategy in an iterative algorithm. Experiments in\ntwo different multiple modal document data sets show the advantage of the\nproposed algorithm over other CFA methods."

    "summary": "We study the classic online learning problem of predicting with expert\nadvice, and propose a truly parameter-free and adaptive algorithm that achieves\nseveral objectives simultaneously without using any prior information. The main\ncomponent of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm\n(Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new\nalgorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost\nconstant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the\nalgorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts\nsimultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and\nthe competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al.\n(2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the\nsleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of\nAdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2)\npredicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these\napplications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a\nspecial case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by\nWarmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal\nshifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses."

Namely, the quality of\nsample compression schemes and of teaching sets for classes of low\nVC-dimension. Let $C$ be a binary concept class of size $m$ and VC-dimension\n$d$. Prior to this work, the best known upper bounds for both parameters were\n$\\log(m)$, while the best lower bounds are linear in $d$. We present\nsignificantly better upper bounds on both as follows. Set $k = O(d 2^d \\log\n\\log |C|)$.\n  We show that there always exists a concept $c$ in $C$ with a teaching set\n(i.e. a list of $c$-labeled examples uniquely identifying $c$ in $C$) of size\n$k$. This problem was studied by Kuhlmann (1999). Our construction implies that\nthe recursive teaching (RT) dimension of $C$ is at most $k$ as well. The\nRT-dimension was suggested by Zilles et al. and Doliwa et al. (2010). The same\nnotion (under the name partial-ID width) was independently studied by Wigderson\nand Yehudayoff (2013). An upper bound on this parameter that depends only on\n$d$ is known just for the very simple case $d=1$, and is open even for $d=2$.\nWe also make small progress towards this seemingly modest goal.\n  We further construct sample compression schemes of size $k$ for $C$, with\nadditional information of $k \\log(k)$ bits. Roughly speaking, given any list of\n$C$-labelled examples of arbitrary length, we can retain only $k$ labeled\nexamples in a way that allows to recover the labels of all others examples in\nthe list, using additional $k\\log (k)$ information bits. This problem was first\nsuggested by Littlestone and Warmuth (1986)."

Roughly, the\nlearner's goal is to find the best policy, or way of behaving, in some space of\npolicies, although \"best\" is not always so clearly defined. Here, we propose a\nnew and natural solution concept, rooted in game theory, called a von Neumann\nwinner, a randomized policy that beats or ties every other policy. We show that\nthis notion overcomes important limitations of existing solutions, particularly\nthe Condorcet winner which has typically been used in the past, but which\nrequires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We then present three\nefficient algorithms for online learning in our setting, and for approximating\na von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these algorithms\nachieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although its\ntime and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space.

    "summary": "Efficiently learning mixture of Gaussians is a fundamental problem in\nstatistics and learning theory. Given samples coming from a random one out of k\nGaussian distributions in Rn, the learning problem asks to estimate the means\nand the covariance matrices of these Gaussians. This learning problem arises in\nmany areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has\nalso found many machine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture\nof Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn\nthe parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is\nexponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case. In this\nwork, we show that provided we are in high enough dimensions, the class of\nGaussian mixtures is learnable in its most general form under a smoothed\nanalysis framework, where the parameters are randomly perturbed from an\nadversarial starting point. In particular, given samples from a mixture of\nGaussians with randomly perturbed parameters, when n > {\\Omega}(k^2), we give\nan algorithm that learns the parameters with polynomial running time and using\npolynomial number of samples. The central algorithmic ideas consist of new ways\nto decompose the moment tensor of the Gaussian mixture by exploiting its\nstructural properties. The symmetries of this tensor are derived from the\ncombinatorial structure of higher order moments of Gaussian distributions\n(sometimes referred to as Isserlis' theorem or Wick's theorem). We also develop\nnew tools for bounding smallest singular values of structured random matrices,\nwhich could be useful in other smoothed analysis settings."

Though most\nexisting works tackle these two problems separately that derives two\nwell-studied sub-areas namely active learning and feature selection, a unified\napproach is inspirational since they are often interleaved with each other.\nNoisy and high-dimensional features will bring adverse effect on sample\nselection, while `good' samples will be beneficial to feature selection. We\npresent a unified framework to conduct active learning and feature selection\nsimultaneously. From the data reconstruction perspective, both the selected\nsamples and features can best approximate the original dataset respectively,\nsuch that the selected samples characterized by the selected features are very\nrepresentative. Additionally our method is one-shot without iteratively\nselecting samples for progressive labeling. Thus our model is especially\nsuitable when the initial labeled samples are scarce or totally absent, which\nexisting works hardly address particularly for simultaneous feature selection.\nTo alleviate the NP-hardness of the raw problem, the proposed formulation\ninvolves a convex but non-smooth optimization problem. We solve it efficiently\nby an iterative algorithm, and prove its global convergence.

A\ncommon example is hierarchical label spaces, corresponding to the case where\none label subsumes another (e.g., animal subsumes dog). But labels can also be\nmutually exclusive (e.g., dog vs cat) or unrelated (e.g., furry, carnivore). To\njointly model hierarchy and exclusion relations, the notion of a HEX (hierarchy\nand exclusion) graph was introduced in [7]. This combined a conditional random\nfield (CRF) with a deep neural network (DNN), resulting in state of the art\nresults when applied to visual object classification problems where the\ntraining labels were drawn from different levels of the ImageNet hierarchy\n(e.g., an image might be labeled with the basic level category \"dog\", rather\nthan the more specific label \"husky\"). In this paper, we extend the HEX model\nto allow for soft or probabilistic relations between labels, which is useful\nwhen there is uncertainty about the relationship between two labels (e.g., an\nantelope is \"sort of\" furry, but not to the same degree as a grizzly bear). We\ncall our new model pHEX, for probabilistic HEX. We show that the pHEX graph can\nbe converted to an Ising model, which allows us to use existing off-the-shelf\ninference methods (in contrast to the HEX method, which needed specialized\ninference algorithms). Experimental results show significant improvements in a\nnumber of large-scale visual object classification tasks, outperforming the\nprevious HEX model."

In particular, recent approaches for discovering\nsimilar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show\nthat such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared,\nand hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find\nthat length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies\non the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected\nby this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally\nnon-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure.\nBased on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure\ntheir significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the\ndissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that\ndepend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability\nof variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series,\nand that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a\nmore broad context."

However, as is well known, the choices of the degree of\npolynomial kernel and the regularization parameter are still open in the realm\nof model selection. The first aim of this paper is to develop a strategy to\nselect these parameters. On one hand, based on the worst-case learning rate\nanalysis, we show that the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression\nis not necessary. In other words, the regularization parameter can decrease\narbitrarily fast when the degree of the polynomial kernel is suitable tuned. On\nthe other hand,taking account of the implementation of the algorithm, the\nregularization term is required. Summarily, the effect of the regularization\nterm in polynomial kernel regression is only to circumvent the \" ill-condition\"\nof the kernel matrix. Based on this, the second purpose of this paper is to\npropose a new model selection strategy, and then design an efficient learning\nalgorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new\nstrategy outperforms the previous one. Theoretically, we prove that the new\nlearning strategy is almost optimal if the regression function is smooth.\nExperimentally, it is shown that the new strategy can significantly reduce the\ncomputational burden without loss of generalization capability."

    "summary": "We resolve an open question from (Christiano, 2014b) posed in COLT'14\nregarding the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local\nlearning on the size of the label set. In this framework the algorithm is shown\na pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then\npredicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a\nreal valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting\nscenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut\namong others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning\nalgorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$\nis the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{n \\log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework\nconcerns closing the above gap.\n  In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main\nresults. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming\nbased algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely,\nwe show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower\nregret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem\nwhich is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a\nrelated conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike\nplanted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known\nquasi-polynomial time algorithms.\n  Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we\nhope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other\nonline learning scenarios as well."

    "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the\ninformation bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be\nquantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and\noutput variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal\ninformation theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization\nbounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is\nquantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity.\nWe argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and\nfeatures/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of\nthe information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input\nlayer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the\nlayered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along\nthe information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new\noptimality bounds and deep learning algorithms."

    "summary": "Time-series classification is an important problem for the data mining\ncommunity due to the wide range of application domains involving time-series\ndata. A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly\npredictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the\nprediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates\ntypically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of\nshapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that\navoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean\ndistance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition,\nour algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out\nonly those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence\non 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4\norders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery\nmethod, while providing better prediction accuracy."

In this paper, we propose a novel network\nembedding method called the \"LINE,\" which is suitable for arbitrary types of\ninformation networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method\noptimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local\nand global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that\naddresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and\nimproves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical\nexperiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world\ninformation networks, including language networks, social networks, and\ncitation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the\nembedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few\nhours on a typical single machine.

The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks\n(GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain\nwhose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the\ntransition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a\nsmall move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small\nmoves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised\nfunction approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by\nback-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the\nprobabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an\ninteresting justification for dependency networks and generalized\npseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and\nsampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent).

In particular, we\nconsider the setting of a decision maker over a networked bandits as follows:\neach time a combinatorial strategy, e.g., a group of arms, is chosen, and the\ndecision maker receives a reward resulting from her strategy and also receives\na side bonus resulting from that strategy for each arm's neighbor. This is\nmotivated by many real applications such as on-line social networks where\nfriends can provide their feedback on shared content, therefore if we promote a\nproduct to a user, we can also collect feedback from her friends on that\nproduct. To this end, we consider two types of side bonus in this study: side\nobservation and side reward. Upon the number of arms pulled at each time slot,\nwe study two cases: single-play and combinatorial-play. Consequently, this\nleaves us four scenarios to investigate in the presence of side bonus:\nSingle-play with Side Observation, Combinatorial-play with Side Observation,\nSingle-play with Side Reward, and Combinatorial-play with Side Reward. For each\ncase, we present and analyze a series of \\emph{zero regret} polices where the\nexpect of regret over time approaches zero as time goes to infinity.

    "summary": "Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is a key machine learning\nalgorithm for extracting nonlinear features from data. In the presence of a\nlarge volume of high dimensional data collected in a distributed fashion, it\nbecomes very costly to communicate all of this data to a single data center and\nthen perform kernel PCA. Can we perform kernel PCA on the entire dataset in a\ndistributed and communication efficient fashion while maintaining provable and\nstrong guarantees in solution quality?\n  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question by developing a\ncommunication efficient algorithm to perform kernel PCA in the distributed\nsetting. The algorithm is a clever combination of subspace embedding and\nadaptive sampling techniques, and we show that the algorithm can take as input\nan arbitrary configuration of distributed datasets, and compute a set of global\nkernel principal components with relative error guarantees independent of the\ndimension of the feature space or the total number of data points. In\nparticular, computing $k$ principal components with relative error $\\epsilon$\nover $s$ workers has communication cost $\\tilde{O}(s \\rho k/\\epsilon+s\nk^2/\\epsilon^3)$ words, where $\\rho$ is the average number of nonzero entries\nin each data point. Furthermore, we experimented the algorithm with large-scale\nreal world datasets and showed that the algorithm produces a high quality\nkernel PCA solution while using significantly less communication than\nalternative approaches."

    "summary": "In supervised learning, simple baseline classifiers can be constructed by\nonly looking at the class, i.e., ignoring any other information from the\ndataset. The single-label learning community frequently uses as a reference the\none which always predicts the majority class. Although a classifier might\nperform worse than this simple baseline classifier, this behaviour requires a\nspecial explanation. Aiming to motivate the community to compare experimental\nresults with the ones provided by a multi-label baseline classifier, calling\nthe attention about the need of special explanations related to classifiers\nwhich perform worse than the baseline, in this work we propose the use of\nGeneral_B, a multi-label baseline classifier. General_B was evaluated in\ncontrast to results published in the literature which were carefully selected\nusing a systematic review process. It was found that a considerable number of\npublished results on 10 frequently used datasets are worse than or equal to the\nones obtained by General_B, and for one dataset it reaches up to 43% of the\ndataset published results. Moreover, although a simple baseline classifier was\nnot considered in these publications, it was observed that even for very poor\nresults no special explanations were provided in most of them. We hope that the\nfindings of this work would encourage the multi-label community to consider the\nidea of using a simple baseline classifier, such that further explanations are\nprovided when a classifiers performs worse than a baseline."

They showed that\ncompression implies PAC learnability for binary-labeled classes, and asked\nwhether the other direction holds. We answer their question and show that every\nconcept class $C$ with VC dimension $d$ has a sample compression scheme of size\nexponential in $d$.

These methods exhibit good empirical performance on a wide variety of\ntasks and enjoy super-linear convergence to the optimal solution. For\nlarge-scale learning problems, stochastic Quasi-Newton methods have been\nrecently proposed. However, these typically only achieve sub-linear convergence\nrates and have not been shown to consistently perform well in practice since\nnoisy Hessian approximations can exacerbate the effect of high-variance\nstochastic gradient estimates. In this work we propose Vite, a novel stochastic\nQuasi-Newton algorithm that uses an existing first-order technique to reduce\nthis variance. Without exploiting the specific form of the approximate Hessian,\nwe show that Vite reaches the optimum at a geometric rate with a constant\nstep-size when dealing with smooth strongly convex functions.

The standard sketch based method, which we call the prototype\nmodel, produces relatively accurate approximations, but is inefficient on large\nsquare matrices. The Nystr\\\"om method is highly efficient, but can only achieve\nlow accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel model that we call the {\\it fast\nSPSD matrix approximation model}.

In order to\ngeneralize categorization axioms into general cases, categorization input and\ncategorization output are reinterpreted by inner and outer category\nrepresentation.

    "summary": "The problem of feature selection has raised considerable interests in the\npast decade. Traditional unsupervised methods select the features which can\nfaithfully preserve the intrinsic structures of data, where the intrinsic\nstructures are estimated using all the input features of data. However, the\nestimated intrinsic structures are unreliable/inaccurate when the redundant and\nnoisy features are not removed. Therefore, we face a dilemma here: one need the\ntrue structures of data to identify the informative features, and one need the\ninformative features to accurately estimate the true structures of data. To\naddress this, we propose a unified learning framework which performs structure\nlearning and feature selection simultaneously. The structures are adaptively\nlearned from the results of feature selection, and the informative features are\nreselected to preserve the refined structures of data. By leveraging the\ninteractions between these two essential tasks, we are able to capture accurate\nstructures and select more informative features. Experimental results on many\nbenchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state\nof the art unsupervised feature selection methods."

This is especially\nimportant in the wireless networks, such as vehicular, where propagation model\nchanges with the density of nodes. The method is based on Stochastic\nExpectation Maximization, where the received data is modeled as a mixture of\ndistributions (no/low interference and strong interference), incomplete\n(censored) due to packet losses. The PDFs in the mixture are Gamma, according\nto the commonly accepted model for wireless signal and interference power. This\napproach leverages the loss count as additional information, hence\noutperforming maximum likelihood estimation, which does not use this\ninformation (ML-), for a small number of received RSSI samples. Hence, it\nallows inexpensive on-line channel estimation from ad-hoc collected data.

The vanilla implementation of DCD is quite slow; however, by\nmaintaining primal variables while updating dual variables, the time complexity\nof SDCD can be significantly reduced. Such a strategy forms the core algorithm\nin the widely-used LIBLINEAR package. In this paper, we parallelize the SDCD\nalgorithms in LIBLINEAR. In recent research, several synchronized parallel SDCD\nalgorithms have been proposed, however, they fail to achieve good speedup in\nthe shared memory multi-core setting. In this paper, we propose a family of\nasynchronous stochastic dual coordinate descent algorithms (ASDCD). Each thread\nrepeatedly selects a random dual variable and conducts coordinate updates using\nthe primal variables that are stored in the shared memory. We analyze the\nconvergence properties when different locking/atomic mechanisms are applied.\nFor implementation with atomic operations, we show linear convergence under\nmild conditions. For implementation without any atomic operations or locking,\nwe present the first {\\it backward error analysis} for ASDCD under the\nmulti-core environment, showing that the converged solution is the exact\nsolution for a primal problem with perturbed regularizer.

It is\nhighly essential for the companies to ensure the recruitment of right talent to\nmaintain a competitive edge over the others in the market. However IT companies\noften face a problem while recruiting new people for their ongoing projects due\nto lack of a proper framework that defines a criteria for the selection\nprocess. In this paper we aim to develop a framework that would allow any\nproject manager to take the right decision for selecting new talent by\ncorrelating performance parameters with the other domain-specific attributes of\nthe candidates. Also, another important motivation behind this project is to\ncheck the validity of the selection procedure often followed by various big\ncompanies in both public and private sectors which focus only on academic\nscores, GPA/grades of students from colleges and other academic backgrounds. We\ntest if such a decision will produce optimal results in the industry or is\nthere a need for change that offers a more holistic approach to recruitment of\nnew talent in the software companies. The scope of this work extends beyond the\nIT domain and a similar procedure can be adopted to develop a recruitment\nframework in other fields as well. Data-mining techniques provide useful\ninformation from the historical projects depending on which the hiring-manager\ncan make decisions for recruiting high-quality workforce. This study aims to\nbridge this hiatus by developing a data-mining framework based on an\nensemble-learning technique to refocus on the criteria for personnel selection.\nThe results from this research clearly demonstrated that there is a need to\nrefocus on the selection-criteria for quality objectives."

In this paper, we study co-occurrence data using a general energy-based\nprobabilistic model, and we analyze three different categories of energy-based\nmodel, namely, the $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_k$ models, which are able to capture\ndifferent levels of dependency in the co-occurrence data.

Opportunity with high data availability\nlevels, automated classification of data sets has become a critical and\ncomplicated function. In this paper, the power of applying MapReduce based\nDistributed AdaBoosting of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are explored to build\nreliable predictive bag of classification models. Thus, (i) dataset ensembles\nare build; (ii) ELM algorithm is used to build weak classification models; and\n(iii) build a strong classification model from a set of weak classification\nmodels. This training model is applied to the publicly available knowledge\ndiscovery and data mining datasets."

    "summary": "Reducing the amount of human supervision is a key problem in machine learning\nand a natural approach is that of exploiting the relations (structure) among\ndifferent tasks. This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this\ncontext a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the\nlearning problem.We tackle this question by studying a general computational\nframework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in\nthe form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed\nmethods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear\napproaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can\nbe efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be\napproached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating\nminimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum."

    "summary": "We consider the following basic learning task: given independent draws from\nan unknown distribution over a discrete support, output an approximation of the\ndistribution that is as accurate as possible in $\\ell_1$ distance (i.e. total\nvariation or statistical distance). Perhaps surprisingly, it is often possible\nto \"de-noise\" the empirical distribution of the samples to return an\napproximation of the true distribution that is significantly more accurate than\nthe empirical distribution, without relying on any prior assumptions on the\ndistribution. We present an instance optimal learning algorithm which optimally\nperforms this de-noising for every distribution for which such a de-noising is\npossible. More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$,\nour algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is\nequal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any\nalgorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution\n$p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that\nis independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual\nimplication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on\nthe \"shape\" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete\nsupport are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.\n  As a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$\nsamples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the\nexpected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any\nsize up to $n \\log n$. This sort of extrapolation is practically relevant,\nparticularly to domains such as genomics where it is important to understand\nhow much more might be discovered given larger sample sizes, and we are\noptimistic that our approach is practically viable."

    "summary": "We introduce a generalization of temporal-difference (TD) learning to\nnetworks of interrelated predictions. Rather than relating a single prediction\nto itself at a later time, as in conventional TD methods, a TD network relates\neach prediction in a set of predictions to other predictions in the set at a\nlater time. TD networks can represent and apply TD learning to a much wider\nclass of predictions than has previously been possible. Using a random-walk\nexample, we show that these networks can be used to learn to predict by a fixed\ninterval, which is not possible with conventional TD methods. Secondly, we show\nthat if the inter-predictive relationships are made conditional on action, then\nthe usual learning-efficiency advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo\n(supervised learning) methods becomes particularly pronounced. Thirdly, we\ndemonstrate that TD networks can learn predictive state representations that\nenable exact solution of a non-Markov problem. A very broad range of\ninter-predictive temporal relationships can be expressed in these networks.\nOverall we argue that TD networks represent a substantial extension of the\nabilities of TD methods and bring us closer to the goal of representing world\nknowledge in entirely predictive, grounded terms."

An offline framework is thus necessary to let us decide what\npolicy and how we should apply in a production environment to ensure positive\noutcome.

    "summary": "Non-linear performance measures are widely used for the evaluation of\nlearning algorithms. For example, $F$-measure is a commonly used performance\nmeasure for classification problems in machine learning and information\nretrieval community. We study the theoretical properties of a subset of\nnon-linear performance measures called pseudo-linear performance measures which\nincludes $F$-measure, \\emph{Jaccard Index}, among many others. We establish\nthat many notions of $F$-measures and \\emph{Jaccard Index} are pseudo-linear\nfunctions of the per-class false negatives and false positives for binary,\nmulticlass and multilabel classification. Based on this observation, we present\na general reduction of such performance measure optimization problem to\ncost-sensitive classification problem with unknown costs. We then propose an\nalgorithm with provable guarantees to obtain an approximately optimal\nclassifier for the $F$-measure by solving a series of cost-sensitive\nclassification problems. The strength of our analysis is to be valid on any\ndataset and any class of classifiers, extending the existing theoretical\nresults on pseudo-linear measures, which are asymptotic in nature. We also\nestablish the multi-objective nature of the $F$-score maximization problem by\nlinking the algorithm with the weighted-sum approach used in multi-objective\noptimization. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the relative\nimportance of cost asymmetry and thresholding when learning linear classifiers\non various $F$-measure optimization tasks."

    "summary": "Is he/she my type or not? The answer to this question depends on the personal\npreferences of the one asking it. The individual process of obtaining a full\nanswer may generally be difficult and time consuming, but often an approximate\nanswer can be obtained simply by looking at a photo of the potential match.\nSuch approximate answers based on visual cues can be produced in a fraction of\na second, a phenomenon that has led to a series of recently successful dating\napps in which users rate others positively or negatively using primarily a\nsingle photo. In this paper we explore using convolutional networks to create a\nmodel of an individual's personal preferences based on rated photos. This\nintroduced task is difficult due to the large number of variations in profile\npictures and the noise in attractiveness labels. Toward this task we collect a\ndataset comprised of $9364$ pictures and binary labels for each. We compare\nperformance of convolutional models trained in three ways: first directly on\nthe collected dataset, second with features transferred from a network trained\nto predict gender, and third with features transferred from a network trained\non ImageNet. Our findings show that ImageNet features transfer best, producing\na model that attains $68.1\\%$ accuracy on the test set and is moderately\nsuccessful at predicting matches."

    "summary": "The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is more expressive than all previously\nconsidered models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader\neffort to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that\ninteracts with them.\n  The capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with proper\nInterfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include\nmemory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem\nverifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model.\nHowever, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search\nengines, are discrete.\n  We examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete\nInterfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape, an\ninput Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to\ntrain a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple\nalgorithmic tasks. Our Interfaces are expressive enough to make our model\nTuring complete."
