    "summary": "Manna and Waldinger's theory of substitutions and unification has been\nverified using the Cambridge LCF theorem prover. A proof of the monotonicity of\nsubstitution is presented in detail, as an example of interaction with LCF.\nTranslating the theory into LCF's domain-theoretic logic is largely\nstraightforward. Well-founded induction on a complex ordering is translated\ninto nested structural inductions. Correctness of unification is expressed\nusing predicates for such properties as idempotence and most-generality. The\nverification is presented as a series of lemmas. The LCF proofs are compared\nwith the original ones, and with other approaches. It appears difficult to find\na logic that is both simple and flexible, especially for proving termination."

Three termination proofs are compared: (1) using a\nmeasure function, (2) in domain theory using LCF, (3) showing that its\nrecursion relation, defined by the pattern of recursive calls, is well-founded.\nThe last two proofs are essentially the same though conducted in markedly\ndifferent logical frameworks. An obviously total variant of the normalize\nfunction is presented as the `computational meaning' of those two proofs. A\nrelated function makes nested recursive calls. The three termination proofs\nbecome more complex: termination and correctness must be proved simultaneously.\nThe recursion relation approach seems flexible enough to handle subtle\ntermination proofs where previously domain theory seemed essential."

A logical language in whose context provability is\nequivalent to uniform provability admits of a goal-directed proof procedure\nthat interprets logical symbols as search directives whose meanings are given\nby the corresponding inference rules. While this uniform provability property\ndoes not hold directly of classical logic, we show that it holds of a fragment\nof it that only excludes essentially positive occurrences of universal\nquantifiers under a modest, sound, modification to the set of assumptions: the\naddition to them of the negation of the formula being proved. We further note\nthat all uses of the added formula can be factored into certain derived rules.\nThe resulting proof system and the uniform provability property that holds of\nit are used to outline a proof procedure for classical logic.

    "summary": "Flat iteration is a variation on the original binary version of the Kleene\nstar operation P*Q, obtained by restricting the first argument to be a sum of\natomic actions. It generalizes prefix iteration, in which the first argument is\na single action. Complete finite equational axiomatizations are given for five\nnotions of bisimulation congruence over basic CCS with flat iteration, viz.\nstrong congruence, branching congruence, eta-congruence, delay congruence and\nweak congruence. Such axiomatizations were already known for prefix iteration\nand are known not to exist for general iteration. The use of flat iteration has\ntwo main advantages over prefix iteration: 1.The current axiomatizations\ngeneralize to full CCS, whereas the prefix iteration approach does not allow an\nelimination theorem for an asynchronous parallel composition operator. 2.The\ngreater expressiveness of flat iteration allows for much shorter completeness\nproofs.\n  In the setting of prefix iteration, the most convenient way to obtain the\ncompleteness theorems for eta-, delay, and weak congruence was by reduction to\nthe completeness theorem for branching congruence. In the case of weak\ncongruence this turned out to be much simpler than the only direct proof found.\nIn the setting of flat iteration on the other hand, the completeness theorems\nfor delay and weak (but not eta-) congruence can equally well be obtained by\nreduction to the one for strong congruence, without using branching congruence\nas an intermediate step. Moreover, the completeness results for prefix\niteration can be retrieved from those for flat iteration, thus obtaining a\nsecond indirect approach for proving completeness for delay and weak congruence\nin the setting of prefix iteration."

    "summary": "Tabled logic programming is receiving increasing attention in the Logic\nProgramming community. It avoids many of the shortcomings of SLD execution and\nprovides a more flexible and often extremely efficient execution mechanism for\nlogic programs. In particular, tabled execution of logic programs terminates\nmore often than execution based on SLD-resolution. In this article, we\nintroduce two notions of universal termination of logic programming with\nTabling: quasi-termination and (the stronger notion of) LG-termination. We\npresent sufficient conditions for these two notions of termination, namely\nquasi-acceptability and LG-acceptability, and we show that these conditions are\nalso necessary in case the tabling is well-chosen. Starting from these\nconditions, we give modular termination proofs, i.e., proofs capable of\ncombining termination proofs of separate programs to obtain termination proofs\nof combined programs. Finally, in the presence of mode information, we state\nsufficient conditions which form the basis for automatically proving\ntermination in a constraint-based way."

This paper introduces various types of normed\nsimulations. In a normed simulation, each step in a lower-level specification\ncan be simulated by at most one step in the higher-level one, for any related\npair of states. In earlier work we demonstrated that normed simulations are\nquite useful as a vehicle for the formalization of refinement proofs via\ntheorem provers. Here we show that normed simulations also have pleasant\ntheoretical properties: (1) under some reasonable assumptions, it is decidable\nwhether a given relation is a normed forward simulation, provided tautology\nchecking is decidable for the underlying logic; (2) at the semantic level,\nnormed forward and backward simulations together form a complete proof method\nfor establishing behavior inclusion, provided that the higher-level\nspecification has finite invisible nondeterminism."

The task is to either find a satisfying\nassignment to Fsat that also satisfies all transitivity constraints over the\nrelational variables (e.g., e[1,2] & e[2,3] ==> e[1,3]), or to prove that no\nsuch assignment exists. Solving this satisfiability problem is the final and\nmost difficult step in our decision procedure for a logic of equality with\nuninterpreted functions. This procedure forms the core of our tool for\nverifying pipelined microprocessors.\n  To use a conventional Boolean satisfiability checker, we augment the set of\nclauses expressing Fsat with clauses expressing the transitivity constraints.\nWe consider methods to reduce the number of such clauses based on the sparse\nstructure of the relational variables.\n  To use Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), we show that for some sets\nE, the OBDD representation of the transitivity constraints has exponential size\nfor all possible variable orderings. By considering only those relational\nvariables that occur in the OBDD representation of Fsat, our experiments show\nthat we can readily construct an OBDD representation of the relevant\ntransitivity constraints and thus solve the constrained satisfiability problem."

However, due to the confluence of our calculi, we come up\nwith computations of the well-founded model that are provably better than these\nmethods.\n  In contrast to other approaches, our transformation method treats magic set\ntransformed programs correctly, i.e. it always computes a relevant part of the\nwell-founded model of the original program."

These semantics arise by\ntaking as interpretation of types subsets of applicative structures, as\ninterpretation of the intersection constructor set-theoretic inclusion, and by\ntaking the interpretation of the arrow constructor a' la Scott, with respect to\neither any possible functionality set, or the largest one, or the least one.\n  These results strengthen and generalize significantly all earlier results in\nthe literature, to our knowledge, in at least three respects. First of all the\ninference semantics had not been considered before. Secondly, the\ncharacterizations are all given just in terms of simple closure conditions on\nthe preorder relation on the types, rather than on the typing judgments\nthemselves. The task of checking the condition is made therefore considerably\nmore tractable. Lastly, we do not restrict attention just to lambda-models, but\nto arbitrary applicative structures which admit an interpretation function.\nThus we allow also for the treatment of models of restricted lambda-calculi.\nNevertheless the characterizations we give can be tailored just to the case of\nlambda-models."

We show that this property can also be phrased as a\nproperty of the proof-theoretic semantics of logic programs, thus abstracting\nfrom the usual operational (top-down) semantics. This proof-theoretic view\nleads us to questioning a condition which is usually considered necessary for\nsubject reduction, namely the head condition.

We investigate the\nrelationship between abstract and concrete models of partial metric algebras.\nIn the course of this investigation, interesting aspects of continuity,\nextensionality and non-determinism are uncovered."

By using the\npattern technique, we give a decidable characterization of the binary\nreachability (i.e., the set of all pairs of configurations such that one can\nreach the other) of a PTA. Since a timed automaton can be treated as a PTA\nwithout the pushdown stack, we can show that the binary reachability of a timed\nautomaton is definable in the additive theory of reals and integers. The\nresults can be used to verify a class of properties containing linear relations\nover both dense variables and unbounded discrete variables. The properties\npreviously could not be verified using the classic region technique nor\nexpressed by timed temporal logics for timed automata and CTL$^*$ for pushdown\nsystems.

Most studies of definitional equality are based on a confluent,\nstrongly-normalizing notion of reduction. Coquand has considered a different\napproach, directly proving the correctness of a practical equivalance algorithm\nbased on the shape of terms. Neither approach appears to scale well to richer\nlanguages with unit types or subtyping, and neither directly addresses the\nproblem of conversion to canonical.\n  In this paper we present a new, type-directed equivalence algorithm for the\nLF type theory that overcomes the weaknesses of previous approaches. The\nalgorithm is practical, scales to richer languages, and yields a new notion of\ncanonical form sufficient for adequate encodings of logical systems. The\nalgorithm is proved complete by a Kripke-style logical relations argument\nsimilar to that suggested by Coquand.

This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously\nanalyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant\nproblems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal\nmodel for abduction with penalization from logic programs, which extends the\nabductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We show the high\nexpressiveness of this formalism, by encoding a couple of relevant problems,\nincluding the well-know Traveling Salesman Problem from optimization theory, in\nthis abductive framework. The resulting encodings are very simple and elegant.\nWe analyze the complexity of the main decisional problems arising in this\nframework. An interesting result in this course is that ``negation comes for\nfree.'' Indeed, the addition of (even unstratified) negation does not cause any\nfurther increase to the complexity of the abductive reasoning tasks (which\nremains the same as for not-free programs)."

We study axioms for the nonmonotonic\nconsequence relation derived from extensions as in Reiter's default logic,\nusing skeptical reasoning, but extensions are now used for the construction of\npossible worlds in a default information structure.\n  In previous work we showed that skeptical reasoning arising from\ndefault-extensions obeys a well-behaved set of axioms including the axiom of\ncautious cut. We show here that, remarkably, the converse is also true: any\nconsequence relation obeying this set of axioms can be represented as one\nconstructed from skeptical reasoning. We provide representation theorems to\nrelate axioms for nonmonotonic consequence relation and properties about\nextensions, and provide one-to-one correspondence between nonmonotonic systems\nwhich satisfies the law of cautious monotony and default structures with unique\nextensions. Our results give a theoretical justification for a set of basic\nrules governing the update of nonmonotonic knowledge bases, demonstrating the\nderivation of them from the more concrete and primitive construction of\nextensions. It is also striking to note that proofs of the representation\ntheorems show that only shallow extensions are necessary, in the sense that the\nnumber of iterations needed to achieve an extension is at most three.

Relying on the notion of easy\nintersection type theory we successfully build a filter model in which the\ninterpretation of an arbitrary simple easy term is any filter which can be\ndescribed in an uniform way by a predicate. This allows us to prove the\nconsistency of a well-know lambda theory: this consistency has interesting\nconsequences on the algebraic structure of the lattice of lambda theories."

As a main theorem we\nshow that Presburger arithmetic is closed under unary counting quantifiers.\nPrecisely, this means that for every first-order formula phi(y,z_1,...,z_k)\nover the signature {<,+} there is a first-order formula psi(x,z_1,...,z_k)\nwhich expresses over the structure <Nat,<,+> (respectively, over initial\nsegments of this structure) that the variable x is interpreted exactly by the\nnumber of possible interpretations of the variable y for which the formula\nphi(y,z_1,...,z_k) is satisfied. Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof\nof Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite\ngraphs is not expressible in first-order logic with unary counting quantifiers\nand addition. Furthermore, the above result on Presburger arithmetic helps to\nshow the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture."

    "summary": "This article answers two questions (posed in the literature), each concerning\nthe guaranteed existence of proofs free of double negation. A proof is free of\ndouble negation if none of its deduced steps contains a term of the form\nn(n(t)) for some term t, where n denotes negation. The first question asks for\nconditions on the hypotheses that, if satisfied, guarantee the existence of a\ndouble-negation-free proof when the conclusion is free of double negation. The\nsecond question asks about the existence of an axiom system for classical\npropositional calculus whose use, for theorems with a conclusion free of double\nnegation, guarantees the existence of a double-negation-free proof. After\ngiving conditions that answer the first question, we answer the second question\nby focusing on the Lukasiewicz three-axiom system. We then extend our studies\nto infinite-valued sentential calculus and to intuitionistic logic and\ngeneralize the notion of being double-negation free. The double-negation proofs\nof interest rely exclusively on the inference rule condensed detachment, a rule\nthat combines modus ponens with an appropriately general rule of substitution.\nThe automated reasoning program OTTER played an indispensable role in this\nstudy."

The different approaches are applicable to different\nmodel types including untimed, timed, probabilistic and stochastic models. This\npaper presents a new framework for model checking techniques which includes\nsome of the known approaches, but enlarges the class of models for which model\nchecking can be applied to the general class of weighted automata. The approach\nallows an easy adaption of model checking to models which have not been\nconsidered yet for this purpose. Examples for those new model types for which\nmodel checking can be applied are max/plus or min/plus automata which are well\nestablished models to describe different forms of dynamic systems and\noptimization problems. In this context, model checking can be used to verify\ntemporal or quantitative properties of a system. The paper first presents\nbriefly our class of weighted automata, as a very general model type. Then\nValued Computational Tree Logic (CTL$) is introduced as a natural extension of\nthe well known branching time logic CTL. Afterwards, algorithms to check a\nweighted automaton according to a CTL$ formula are presented. As a last result,\na bisimulation is presented for weighted automata and for CTL$."

We provide the logic\nwith a sound and complete axiomatization. The contribution is that it is\npossible to reason about properties that involve several components, even in\nthe absence of a global clock. Then, we define the Distributed States Temporal\nLogic (DSTL) by introducing temporal operators a' la Unity. We support our\nproposal by working out a pair of examples: a simple secure communication\nsystem, and an algorithm for distributed leader election.\n  The motivation for this work is that the existing logics for distributed\nsystems do not have the right expressive power to reason on the systems\nbehaviour, when the communication is based on asynchronous message passing. On\nthe other side, asynchronous communication is the most used abstraction when\nmodelling global applications."

    "summary": "Until recently, First-Order Temporal Logic (FOTL) has been little understood.\nWhile it is well known that the full logic has no finite axiomatisation, a more\ndetailed analysis of fragments of the logic was not previously available.\nHowever, a breakthrough by Hodkinson et.al., identifying a finitely\naxiomatisable fragment, termed the monodic fragment, has led to improved\nunderstanding of FOTL. Yet, in order to utilise these theoretical advances, it\nis important to have appropriate proof techniques for the monodic fragment.\n  In this paper, we modify and extend the clausal temporal resolution\ntechnique, originally developed for propositional temporal logics, to enable\nits use in such monodic fragments. We develop a specific normal form for\nformulae in FOTL, and provide a complete resolution calculus for formulae in\nthis form. Not only is this clausal resolution technique useful as a practical\nproof technique for certain monodic classes, but the use of this approach\nprovides us with increased understanding of the monodic fragment. In\nparticular, we here show how several features of monodic FOTL are established\nas corollaries of the completeness result for the clausal temporal resolution\nmethod. These include definitions of new decidable monodic classes,\nsimplification of existing monodic classes by reductions, and completeness of\nclausal temporal resolution in the case of monodic logics with expanding\ndomains, a case with much significance in both theory and practice."

This translation is\ntheoretically interesting because it translates modal logics with certain frame\nconditions into first-order logic, without explicitly expressing the frame\nconditions.\n  A consequence of the translation is that the general satisfiability problem\nfor regular grammar logics with converse is in EXPTIME. This extends a previous\nresult of the first author for grammar logics without converse. Using the same\nmethod, we show how some other modal logics can be naturally translated into\nGF2, including nominal tense logics and intuitionistic logic.\n  In our view, the results in this paper show that the natural first-order\nfragment corresponding to regular grammar logics is simply GF2 without extra\nmachinery such as fixed point-operators."

We develop a theory of\nmca-programs. We demonstrate that the operational concept of the one-step\nprovability operator generalizes to mca-programs, but the generalization\ninvolves nondeterminism. Our main results show that the formalism of\nmca-programs is a common generalization of (1) normal logic programming with\nits semantics of models, supported models and stable models, (2) logic\nprogramming with cardinality atoms and with the semantics of stable models, as\ndefined by Niemela, Simons and Soininen, and (3) of disjunctive logic\nprogramming with the possible-model semantics of Sakama and Inoue."

Many combinatorial theorems establish, often constructively,\nthe existence of positive integer functions, without actually providing their\nclosed algebraic form or tight lower and upper bounds. The area of Ramsey\ntheory is especially rich in such results. Using the problem of computing van\nder Waerden numbers as an example, we show that these problems can be\nrepresented by parameterized propositional theories in such a way that\ndecisions concerning their satisfiability determine the numbers (function) in\nquestion. We show that by using general-purpose complete and local-search\ntechniques for testing propositional satisfiability, this approach becomes\neffective -- competitive with specialized approaches. By following it, we were\nable to obtain several new results pertaining to the problem of computing van\nder Waerden numbers. We also note that due to their properties, especially\ntheir structural simplicity and computational hardness, propositional theories\nthat arise in this research can be of use in development, testing and\nbenchmarking of SAT solvers."

    "summary": "Suitable extensions of the monadic second-order theory of k successors have\nbeen proposed in the literature to capture the notion of time granularity. In\nthis paper, we provide the monadic second-order theories of downward unbounded\nlayered structures, which are infinitely refinable structures consisting of a\ncoarsest domain and an infinite number of finer and finer domains, and of\nupward unbounded layered structures, which consist of a finest domain and an\ninfinite number of coarser and coarser domains, with expressively complete and\nelementarily decidable temporal logic counterparts.\n  We obtain such a result in two steps. First, we define a new class of\ncombined automata, called temporalized automata, which can be proved to be the\nautomata-theoretic counterpart of temporalized logics, and show that relevant\nproperties, such as closure under Boolean operations, decidability, and\nexpressive equivalence with respect to temporal logics, transfer from component\nautomata to temporalized ones. Then, we exploit the correspondence between\ntemporalized logics and automata to reduce the task of finding the temporal\nlogic counterparts of the given theories of time granularity to the easier one\nof finding temporalized automata counterparts of them."

We further improve on Forum by restricting the class of\nformulae allowed, in a system we call G-Forum, which is still equivalent to\nfull first order linear logic.

The rapid development of quantum computation in\nrecent years stimulates us to establish a theory of computation based on\nquantum logic. The present paper is the first step toward such a new theory and\nit focuses on the simplest models of computation, namely finite automata. It is\nfound that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily\nupon the distributivity of the underlying logic. This indicates that these\nproperties does not universally hold in the realm of quantum logic.

We study model\nchecking of systems which are data-independent with respect to two distinct\ntype variables X and Y, and may in addition use arrays with indices from X and\nvalues from Y . Our main interest is the following parameterised model-checking\nproblem: whether a given program satisfies a given temporal-logic formula for\nall non-empty nite instances of X and Y . Initially, we consider instead the\nabstraction where X and Y are infinite and where partial functions with finite\ndomains are used to model arrays. Using a translation to data-independent\nsystems without arrays, we show that the u-calculus model-checking problem is\ndecidable for these systems. From this result, we can deduce properties of all\nsystems with finite instances of X and Y . We show that there is a procedure\nfor the above parameterised model-checking problem of the universal fragment of\nthe u-calculus, such that it always terminates but may give false negatives. We\nalso deduce that the parameterised model-checking problem of the universal\ndisjunction-free fragment of the u-calculus is decidable.

The proposed approach is an extension of\nthe well-known Magic-Set technique and is well-suited for being integrated in\ncurrent bottom-up (stable) model inference engines. More specifically, it is\nbased on the exploitation of binding propagation techniques which reduce the\nsize of the data relevant to answer the query and, consequently, reduces both\nthe complexity of computing a single model and the number of models to be\nconsidered. The motivation of this work stems from the observation that\ntraditional binding propagation optimization techniques for bottom-up model\ngenerator systems, simulating the goal driven evaluation of top-down engines,\nare only suitable for positive (disjunctive) queries, while hard problems are\nexpressed using unstratified negation. The main contribution of the paper\nconsists in the extension of a previous technique, defined for positive\ndisjunctive queries, to queries containing both disjunctive heads and\nconstraints (a simple and expressive form of unstratified negation). As the\nusual way of expressing declaratively hard problems is based on the\nguess-and-check technique, where the guess part is expressed by means of\ndisjunctive rules and the check part is expressed by means of constraints, the\ntechnique proposed here is highly relevant for the optimization of queries\nexpressing hard problems.

    "summary": "Many existing algorithms for model checking of infinite-state systems operate\non constraints which are used to represent (potentially infinite) sets of\nstates. A general powerful technique which can be employed for proving\ntermination of these algorithms is that of well quasi-orderings. Several\nmethodologies have been proposed for derivation of new well quasi-ordered\nconstraint systems. However, many of these constraint systems suffer from a\n\"constraint explosion problem\", as the number of the generated constraints\ngrows exponentially with the size of the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a refinement of the theory of well quasi-orderings, called the theory of\nbetter quasi-orderings, is more appropriate for symbolic model checking, since\nit allows inventing constraint systems which are both well quasi-ordered and\ncompact. As a main application, we introduce existential zones, a constraint\nsystem for verification of systems with unboundedly many clocks and use our\nmethodology to prove that existential zones are better quasi-ordered. We show\nhow to use existential zones in verification of timed Petri nets and present\nsome experimental results. Also, we apply our methodology to derive new\nconstraint systems for verification of broadcast protocols, lossy channel\nsystems, and integral relational automata. The new constraint systems are\nexponentially more succinct than existing ones, and their well quasi-ordering\ncannot be shown by previous methods in the literature."

In order to fully benefit from this theory, we believe that it can\nbe enriched with notions such as approximation by computation or\nrepresentability. The latter are commonly studied in denotational semantics and\ndomain theory and captured most prominently by the notion of algebraicity, e.g.\nof lattices. In this paper, we explore the notion of algebraicity in formal\nconcept analysis from a category-theoretical perspective. To this end, we build\non the the notion of approximable concept with a suitable category and show\nthat the latter is equivalent to the category of algebraic lattices. At the\nsame time, the paper provides a relatively comprehensive account of the\nrepresentation theory of algebraic lattices in the framework of Stone duality,\nrelating well-known structures such as Scott information systems with further\nformalisms from logic, topology, domains and lattice theory."

    "summary": "Tableaux-based decision procedures for satisfiability of modal and\ndescription logics behave quite well in practice, but it is sometimes hard to\nobtain exact worst-case complexity results using these approaches, especially\nfor EXPTIME-complete logics. In contrast, automata-based approaches often yield\nalgorithms for which optimal worst-case complexity can easily be proved.\nHowever, the algorithms obtained this way are usually not only worst-case, but\nalso best-case exponential: they first construct an automaton that is always\nexponential in the size of the input, and then apply the (polynomial) emptiness\ntest to this large automaton. To overcome this problem, one must try to\nconstruct the automaton \"on-the-fly\" while performing the emptiness test.\n  In this paper we will show that Voronkov's inverse method for the modal logic\nK can be seen as an on-the-fly realization of the emptiness test done by the\nautomata approach for K. The benefits of this result are two-fold. First, it\nshows that Voronkov's implementation of the inverse method, which behaves quite\nwell in practice, is an optimized on-the-fly implementation of the\nautomata-based satisfiability procedure for K. Second, it can be used to give a\nsimpler proof of the fact that Voronkov's optimizations do not destroy\ncompleteness of the procedure. We will also show that the inverse method can\neasily be extended to handle global axioms, and that the correspondence to the\nautomata approach still holds in this setting. In particular, the inverse\nmethod yields an EXPTIME-algorithm for satisfiability in K w.r.t. global\naxioms."

We prove\nthat:\n  (i) Up to a polynomial factor, the 2- and the 3-variable fragments of\nfirst-order logic on linear orders have the same succinctness. (ii) The\n4-variable fragment is exponentially more succinct than the 3-variable\nfragment. Our second main result compares the succinctness of first-order logic\non linear orders with that of monadic second-order logic.

The interval neutrosophic logic can reason and\nmodel fuzzy, incomplete and inconsistent information.

The interval neutrosophic inference system can be\napplied to decision making. Chapter 3 gives one application of interval\nneutrosophic sets and logic in the field of relational databases. Neutrosophic\ndata model is the generalization of fuzzy data model and paraconsistent data\nmodel. Here, we generalize various set-theoretic and relation-theoretic\noperations of fuzzy data model to neutrosophic data model. Chapter 4 gives\nanother application of interval neutrosophic logic.

In the last years several studies\nhave investigated how to extend model checking techniques to systems with an\ninfinite number of states. In this paper we propose an approach which exploits\nthe computation model of tccp. Constraint based computations allow us to define\na methodology for applying a model checking algorithm to (a class of)\ninfinite-state systems. We extend the classical algorithm of model checking for\nLTL to a specific logic defined for the verification of tccp and to the tccp\nStructure which we define in this work for modeling the program behavior.

Here, a different solution is\nproposed: exploiting coinductive types to model infinite computations. To every\ntype A we associate a type of partial elements Partial(A), coinductively\ngenerated by two constructors: the first, return(a) just returns an element\na:A; the second, step(x), adds a computation step to a recursive element\nx:Partial(A). We show how this simple device is sufficient to formalize all\nrecursive functions between two given types. It allows the definition of fixed\npoints of finitary, that is, continuous, operators.

    "summary": "This paper describes a simpler way for programmers to reason about the\ncorrectness of their code. The study of semantics of logic programs has shown\nstrong links between the model theoretic semantics (truth and falsity of atoms\nin the programmer's interpretation of a program), procedural semantics (for\nexample, SLD resolution) and fixpoint semantics (which is useful for program\nanalysis and alternative execution mechanisms). Most of this work assumes that\nintended interpretations are two-valued: a ground atom is true (and should\nsucceed according to the procedural semantics) or false (and should not\nsucceed). In reality, intended interpretations are less precise. Programmers\nconsider that some atoms \"should not occur\" or are \"ill-typed\" or\n\"inadmissible\". Programmers don't know and don't care whether such atoms\nsucceed. In this paper we propose a three-valued semantics for (essentially)\npure Prolog programs with (ground) negation as failure which reflects this. The\nsemantics of Fitting is similar but only associates the third truth value with\nnon-termination. We provide tools to reason about correctness of programs\nwithout the need for unnatural precision or undue restrictions on programming\nstyle. As well as theoretical results, we provide a programmer-oriented\nsynopsis. This work has come out of work on declarative debugging, where it has\nbeen recognised that inadmissible calls are important. This paper has been\naccepted to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming."

In particular, we show that the number of bits needed per integer\nvariable is linear in the number of non-difference constraints and logarithmic\nin the number and size of non-zero coefficients in them, but is otherwise\nindependent of the total number of linear constraints in the formula. The\nderived bound can be used in a decision procedure based on instantiating\ninteger variables over a finite domain and translating the input\nquantifier-free Presburger formula to an equi-satisfiable Boolean formula,\nwhich is then checked using a Boolean satisfiability solver. In addition to our\nmain theoretical result, we discuss several optimizations for deriving tighter\nbounds in practice. Empirical evidence indicates that our decision procedure\ncan greatly outperform other decision procedures."

    "summary": "We study the problem of efficient, scalable set-sharing analysis of logic\nprograms. We use the idea of representing sharing information as a pair of\nabstract substitutions, one of which is a worst-case sharing representation\ncalled a clique set, which was previously proposed for the case of inferring\npair-sharing. We use the clique-set representation for (1) inferring actual\nset-sharing information, and (2) analysis within a top-down framework. In\nparticular, we define the abstract functions required by standard top-down\nanalyses, both for sharing alone and also for the case of including freeness in\naddition to sharing. Our experimental evaluation supports the conclusion that,\nfor inferring set-sharing, as it was the case for inferring pair-sharing,\nprecision losses are limited, while useful efficiency gains are obtained. At\nthe limit, the clique-set representation allowed analyzing some programs that\nexceeded memory capacity using classical sharing representations."

In our study, an aggregate\ncan be an arbitrary interpreted second order predicate or function. We define\nextensions of the Kripke-Kleene, the well-founded and the stable semantics for\naggregate programs. The semantics is based on the concept of a three-valued\nimmediate consequence operator of an aggregate program. Such an operator\napproximates the standard two-valued immediate consequence operator of the\nprogram, and induces a unique Kripke-Kleene model, a unique well-founded model\nand a collection of stable models. We study different ways of defining such\noperators and thus obtain a framework of semantics, offering different\ntrade-offs between precision and tractability. In particular, we investigate\nconditions on the operator that guarantee that the computation of the three\ntypes of semantics remains on the same level as for logic programs without\naggregates. Other results show that, in practice, even efficient three-valued\nimmediate consequence operators which are very low in the precision hierarchy,\nstill provide optimal precision."

The contributions of this paper are: a) We embed CTL into\nSTD which is a proper fragment of stratified Datalog. Moreover we show that STD\nexpresses exactly CTL -- we prove that by embedding STD into CTL. Both\nembeddings are linear. b) CTL can also be embedded to fragments of Datalog\nwithout negation. We define a fragment of Datalog with the successor build-in\npredicate that we call TDS and we embed CTL into TDS in linear time. We build\non the above relations to answer open problems of stratified Datalog. We prove\nthat query evaluation is linear and that containment and satisfiability\nproblems are both decidable.

    "summary": "It is common practice to compare the computational power of different models\nof computation. For example, the recursive functions are strictly more powerful\nthan the primitive recursive functions, because the latter are a proper subset\nof the former (which includes Ackermann's function). Side-by-side with this\n\"containment\" method of measuring power, it is standard to use an approach\nbased on \"simulation\". For example, one says that the (untyped) lambda calculus\nis as powerful--computationally speaking--as the partial recursive functions,\nbecause the lambda calculus can simulate all partial recursive functions by\nencoding the natural numbers as Church numerals.\n  The problem is that unbridled use of these two ways of comparing power allows\none to show that some computational models are strictly stronger than\nthemselves! We argue that a better definition is that model A is strictly\nstronger than B if A can simulate B via some encoding, whereas B cannot\nsimulate A under any encoding. We then show that the recursive functions are\nstrictly stronger in this sense than the primitive recursive. We also prove\nthat the recursive functions, partial recursive functions, and Turing machines\nare \"complete\", in the sense that no injective encoding can make them\nequivalent to any \"hypercomputational\" model."

    "summary": "Lossy channel systems (LCSs) are systems of finite state automata that\ncommunicate via unreliable unbounded fifo channels. In order to circumvent the\nundecidability of model checking for nondeterministic\n  LCSs, probabilistic models have been introduced, where it can be decided\nwhether a linear-time property holds almost surely. However, such fully\nprobabilistic systems are not a faithful model of nondeterministic protocols.\n  We study a hybrid model for LCSs where losses of messages are seen as faults\noccurring with some given probability, and where the internal behavior of the\nsystem remains nondeterministic. Thus the semantics is in terms of\ninfinite-state Markov decision processes. The purpose of this article is to\ndiscuss the decidability of linear-time properties formalized by formulas of\nlinear temporal logic (LTL). Our focus is on the qualitative setting where one\nasks, e.g., whether a LTL-formula holds almost surely or with zero probability\n(in case the formula describes the bad behaviors). Surprisingly, it turns out\nthat -- in contrast to finite-state Markov decision processes -- the\nsatisfaction relation for LTL formulas depends on the chosen type of schedulers\nthat resolve the nondeterminism. While all variants of the qualitative LTL\nmodel checking problem for the full class of history-dependent schedulers are\nundecidable, the same questions for finite-memory scheduler can be solved\nalgorithmically. However, the restriction to reachability properties and\nspecial kinds of recurrent reachability properties yields decidable\nverification problems for the full class of schedulers, which -- for this\nrestricted class of properties -- are as powerful as finite-memory schedulers,\nor even a subclass of them."

    "summary": "The term ``Boolean category'' should be used for describing an object that is\nto categories what a Boolean algebra is to posets. More specifically, a Boolean\ncategory should provide the abstract algebraic structure underlying the proofs\nin Boolean Logic, in the same sense as a Cartesian closed category captures the\nproofs in intuitionistic logic and a *-autonomous category captures the proofs\nin linear logic. However, recent work has shown that there is no canonical\naxiomatisation of a Boolean category. In this work, we will see a series (with\nincreasing strength) of possible such axiomatisations, all based on the notion\nof *-autonomous category. We will particularly focus on the medial map, which\nhas its origin in an inference rule in KS, a cut-free deductive system for\nBoolean logic in the calculus of structures. Finally, we will present a\ncategory of proof nets as a particularly well-behaved example of a Boolean\ncategory."

    "summary": "We present a hierarchical framework for analysing propositional linear-time\ntemporal logic (PTL) to obtain standard results such as a small model property,\ndecision procedures and axiomatic completeness. Both finite time and infinite\ntime are considered and one consequent benefit of the framework is the ability\nto systematically reduce infinite-time reasoning to finite-time reasoning. The\ntreatment of PTL with both the operator Until and past time naturally reduces\nto that for PTL without either one. Our method utilises a low-level normal form\nfor PTL called a \"transition configuration\". In addition, we employ reasoning\nabout intervals of time. Besides being hierarchical and interval-based, the\napproach differs from other analyses of PTL typically based on sets of formulas\nand sequences of such sets. Instead we describe models using time intervals\nrepresented as finite and infinite sequences of states. The analysis relates\nlarger intervals with smaller ones. Steps involved are expressed in\nPropositional Interval Temporal Logic (PITL) which is better suited than PTL\nfor sequentially combining and decomposing formulas. Consequently, we can\narticulate issues in PTL model construction of equal relevance in more\nconventional analyses but normally only considered at the metalevel. We also\ndescribe a decision procedure based on Binary Decision Diagrams."

    "summary": "Modal formulae express monadic second-order properties on Kripke frames, but\nin many important cases these have first-order equivalents. Computing such\nequivalents is important for both logical and computational reasons. On the\nother hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies\nframe-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae.\n  Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination\nof second-order quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for\nsecond-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and\nDLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann.\n  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order\nequivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for\nproving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on\nmodal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of\nunskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some\nexamples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on\nwhich the algorithm succeeds. We show that it succeeds not only on all\nSahlqvist formulae, but also on the larger class of inductive formulae,\nintroduced in our earlier papers. Thus, we develop a purely algorithmic\napproach to proving canonical completeness in modal logic and, in particular,\nestablish one of the most general completeness results in modal logic so far."

The systems we want to\nverify are specified through a top-down refinement process. In order to deal\nwith the state explosion problem, we have proposed in previous works to\npartition the reachability graph, and to perform the verification on each part\nseparately. Moreover, we have defined a class, called Bmod, of dynamic\nproperties that are verifiable by parts, whatever the partition. We decide if a\nproperty P belongs to Bmod by looking at the form of the Buchi automaton that\naccepts the negation of P. However, when a property P belongs to Bmod, the\nproperty f => P, where f is a fairness assumption, does not necessarily belong\nto Bmod. In this paper, we propose to use the refinement process in order to\nbuild the parts on which the verification has to be performed. We then show\nthat with such a partition, if a property P is verifiable by parts and if f is\nthe expression of the fairness assumptions on a system, then the property f =>\nP is still verifiable by parts. This approach is illustrated by its application\nto the chip card protocol T=1 using the B engineering design language."

A pivot is a fixed\nsubset of valuations which are considered to be the important ones in the\nabsolute sense. We worked with a general notion of valuation that covers e.g.\nthe classical valuations as well as certain kinds of many-valued valuations. In\nthe many-valued cases, pivotal consequence relations are paraconsistant (in\naddition to be plausible), i.e. they are capable of drawing reasonable\nconclusions which contain contradictions. We will provide in our general\nframework syntactic characterizations of several families of pivotal relations.\nIn addition, we will provide, again in our general framework, characterizations\nof several families of pivotal discriminative consequence relations. The latter\nare defined exactly as the plain version, but contradictory conclusions are\nrejected. We will also answer negatively a representation problem that was left\nopen by Makinson.

A natural notion of query acyclicity for this language\nis introduced and we study the complexity of a large number of variants or\ngeneralizations of acyclic query problems in that context (Boolean or not\nBoolean, with or without inequalities, comparisons, etc...). Our main results\nshow that all those problems are \\textit{fixed-parameter linear} i.e. they can\nbe evaluated in time $f(|Q|).|\\textbf{db}|.|Q(\\textbf{db})|$ where $|Q|$ is the\nsize of the query $Q$, $|\\textbf{db}|$ the database size, $|Q(\\textbf{db})|$ is\nthe size of the output and $f$ is some function whose value depends on the\nspecific variant of the query problem (in some cases, $f$ is the identity\nfunction). Our results have two kinds of consequences. First, they can be\neasily translated in the relational (i.e., classical) setting. Previously known\nbounds for some query problems are improved and new tractable cases are then\nexhibited. Among others, as an immediate corollary, we improve a result of\n\\~\\cite{PapadimitriouY-99} by showing that any (relational) acyclic conjunctive\nquery with inequalities can be evaluated in time\n$f(|Q|).|\\textbf{db}|.|Q(\\textbf{db})|$.

Notably, FDESs have been applied to biomedical control for\nHIV/AIDS treatment planning and sensory information processing for robotic\ncontrol. Qiu, Cao and Ying independently developed supervisory control theory\nof FDESs. We note that the controllability of events in Qiu's work is fuzzy but\nthe observability of events is crisp, and, the observability of events in Cao\nand Ying's work is also crisp although the controllability is not completely\ncrisp since the controllable events can be disabled with any degrees. Motivated\nby the necessity to consider the situation that the events may be observed or\ncontrolled with some membership degrees, in this paper, we establish the\nsupervisory control theory of FDESs with partial observations, in which both\nthe observability and controllability of events are fuzzy instead. We formalize\nthe notions of fuzzy controllability condition and fuzzy observability\ncondition. And Controllability and Observability Theorem of FDESs is set up in\na more generic framework. In particular, we present a detailed computing flow\nto verify whether the controllability and observability conditions hold. Thus,\nthis result can decide the existence of supervisors. Also, we use this\ncomputing method to check the existence of supervisors in the Controllability\nand Observability Theorem of classical discrete event systems (DESs), which is\na new method and different from classical case. A number of examples are\nelaborated on to illustrate the presented results."

    "summary": "Lehmann, Magidor, and Schlechta developed an approach to belief revision\nbased on distances between any two valuations. Suppose we are given such a\ndistance D. This defines an operator |D, called a distance operator, which\ntransforms any two sets of valuations V and W into the set V |D W of all\nelements of W that are closest to V. This operator |D defines naturally the\nrevision of K by A as the set of all formulas satisfied in M(K) |D M(A) (i.e.\nthose models of A that are closest to the models of K). This constitutes a\ndistance-based revision operator. Lehmann et al. characterized families of them\nusing a loop condition of arbitrarily big size. An interesting question is\nwhether this loop condition can be replaced by a finite one. Extending the\nresults of Schlechta, we will provide elements of negative answer. In fact, we\nwill show that for families of distance operators, there is no \"normal\"\ncharacterization. Approximatively, a normal characterization contains only\nfinite and universally quantified conditions. These results have an interest of\ntheir own for they help to understand the limits of what is possible in this\narea. Now, we are quite confident that this work can be continued to show\nsimilar impossibility results for distance-based revision operators, which\nsuggests that the big loop condition cannot be simplified."

    "summary": "The refinement calculus for logic programs is a framework for deriving logic\nprograms from specifications. It is based on a wide-spectrum language that can\nexpress both specifications and code, and a refinement relation that models the\nnotion of correct implementation. In this paper we extend and generalise\nearlier work on contextual refinement. Contextual refinement simplifies the\nrefinement process by abstractly capturing the context of a subcomponent of a\nprogram, which typically includes information about the values of the free\nvariables. This paper also extends and generalises module refinement. A module\nis a collection of procedures that operate on a common data type; module\nrefinement between a specification module A and an implementation module C\nallows calls to the procedures of A to be systematically replaced with calls to\nthe corresponding procedures of C. Based on the conditions for module\nrefinement, we present a method for calculating an implementation module from a\nspecification module. Both contextual and module refinement within the\nrefinement calculus have been generalised from earlier work and the results are\npresented in a unified framework."

In (hyper)coherence semantics, the\nargument of a (strongly) stable functional is always a (strongly) stable\nfunction. As a consequence, comparatively to the relational semantics, where\nthere is no edge relation, some vertices are missing. Recovering these vertices\nis essential for the purpose of reconstructing proofs/terms from their\ninterpretations. It shall also be useful for the comparison with other\nsemantics, like game semantics. In [BE01], Bucciarelli and Ehrhard introduced a\nso called non uniform coherence space semantics where no vertex is missing. By\nconstructing the co-free exponential we set a new version of this last\nsemantics, together with non uniform versions of hypercoherences and\nmulticoherences, a new semantics where an edge is a finite multiset. Thanks to\nthe co-free construction, these non uniform semantics are deterministic in the\nsense that the intersection of a clique and of an anti-clique contains at most\none vertex, a result of interaction, and extensionally collapse onto the\ncorresponding uniform semantics."

In logic,\ntermination is at the heart of proof theory where it is usually called strong\nnormalization (of cut elimination). In computer science, termination has always\nbeen an important issue for showing programs correct. In the early days of\nlogic, strong normalization was usually shown by assigning ordinals to\nexpressions in such a way that eliminating a cut would yield an expression with\na smaller ordinal. In the early days of verification, computer scientists used\nsimilar ideas, interpreting the arguments of a program call by a natural\nnumber, such as their size. Showing the size of the arguments to decrease for\neach recursive call gives a termination proof of the program, which is however\nrather weak since it can only yield quite small ordinals. In the sixties, Tait\ninvented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based\non a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression\nto the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.\nThe predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this\nmethod could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the\nname of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in\nproving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi..."

Eight new ideas for a precise setup of\narithmetical logic and its metalanguage give the proper environment for the\nconstruction of a special computer, the ARBACUS computer.

The ARBATOR is defined as a calculator with\ntwo-layer-computation. It allows for the calculation of all primitive recursive\nfunctions, but multi-level-arbation also allows for the calculation of other\narbative functions that are not primitive recursive. The new paradigm of\ncalculation does not have the above mentioned shortcoming. The defenders of\nChurch's thesis are challenged to show that exotic arbative functions are\nrecursive and to put forward a recursive function that is not arbative.

    "summary": "We propose to use Tarski's least fixpoint theorem as a basis to define\nrecursive functions in the calculus of inductive constructions. This widens the\nclass of functions that can be modeled in type-theory based theorem proving\ntool to potentially non-terminating functions. This is only possible if we\nextend the logical framework by adding the axioms that correspond to classical\nlogic. We claim that the extended framework makes it possible to reason about\nterminating and non-terminating computations and we show that common facilities\nof the calculus of inductive construction, like program extraction can be\nextended to also handle the new functions."

The later approach has been extended by Jouannaud, Okada and the present\nauthor into Inductive Data Type Systems (IDTSs). In this paper, we extend IDTSs\nwith the CRS higher-order pattern-matching mechanism, resulting in simply-typed\nCRSs. Then, we show how the termination criterion developed for IDTSs with\nfirst-order pattern-matching, called the General Schema, can be extended so as\nto prove the strong normalization of IDTSs with higher-order pattern-matching.\nNext, we compare the unified approach with HRSs. We first prove that the\nextended General Schema can also be applied to HRSs. Second, we show how\nNipkow's higher-order critical pair analysis technique for proving local\nconfluence can be applied to IDTSs."

This version\nslightly differs from the one which has been distributed at the school because\ntypos have been removed and comments and suggestions by students have been\nworked in. The course is intended to be introductory. That means no prior\nknowledge of proof nets is required. However, the student should be familiar\nwith the basics of propositional logic, and should have seen formal proofs in\nsome formal deductive system (e.g., sequent calculus, natural deduction,\nresolution, tableaux, calculus of structures, Frege-Hilbert-systems, ...). It\nis probably helpful if the student knows already what cut elimination is, but\nthis is not strictly necessary. In these notes, I will introduce the concept of\n``proof nets'' from the viewpoint of the problem of the identity of proofs. I\nwill proceed in a rather informal way. The focus will be more on presenting\nideas than on presenting technical details. The goal of the course is to give\nthe student an overview of the theory of proof nets and make the vast amount of\nliterature on the topic easier accessible to the beginner. For introducing the\nbasic concepts of the theory, I will in the first part of the course stick to\nthe unit-free multiplicative fragment of linear logic because of its rather\nsimple notion of proof nets. In the second part of the course we will see proof\nnets for more sophisticated logics. This is a basic introduction into proof\nnets from the perspective of the identity of proofs. We discuss how deductive\nproofs can be translated into proof nets and what a correctness criterion is."

By using the virtual unrolling\ntechnique minimal length counterexamples can be captured, however, the size of\nthe encoding is quadratic in the specification. We also extend virtual\nunrolling to Buchi automata, enabling them to accept minimal length\ncounterexamples.\n  Our BMC encodings can be made incremental in order to benefit from\nincremental SAT technology. With fairly small modifications the incremental\nencoding can be further enhanced with a termination check, allowing us to prove\nproperties with BMC. Experiments clearly show that our new encodings improve\nperformance of BMC considerably, particularly in the case of the incremental\nencoding, and that they are very competitive for finding bugs. An analysis of\nthe liveness-to-safety transformation reveals many similarities to the BMC\nencodings in this paper.

On the other hand,\nuniversal zenoness, i.e., the question if all infinite computations from a\ngiven marking are zeno, is undecidable. (ii) Token liveness: whether a token is\nalive in a marking, i.e., whether there is a computation from the marking which\neventually consumes the token. We show decidability of the problem by reducing\nit to the coverability problem, which is decidable for TPNs. (iii) Boundedness:\nwhether the size of the reachable markings is bounded. We consider two versions\nof the problem; namely semantic boundedness where only live tokens are taken\ninto consideration in the markings, and syntactic boundedness where also dead\ntokens are considered.

The first one addresses\nsome of the issues related to ultrafinitistic programs, as well as some of the\ncore ideas proposed thus far. The second part of the paper presents a model of\nultrafinitistic arithmetics based on the notion of fuzzy initial segments of\nthe standard natural numbers series. We also introduce a proof theory and a\nsemantics for ultrafinitism through which feasibly consistent theories can be\ntreated on the same footing as their classically consistent counterparts. We\nconclude with a brief sketch of a foundational program, that aims at\nreproducing the transfinite within the finite realm."

It is also well known in model checking that bisimulation is equivalent\nto strong preservation of CTL, or, equivalently, of Hennessy-Milner logic.\nDrawing on these observations, we analyze the basic steps of the PT algorithm\nfrom an abstract interpretation perspective, which allows us to reason on\nstrong preservation in the context of generic inductively defined (temporal)\nlanguages and of possibly non-partitioning abstract models specified by\nabstract interpretation. This leads us to design a generalized Paige-Tarjan\nalgorithm, called GPT, for computing the minimal refinement of an abstract\ninterpretation-based model that strongly preserves some given language. It\nturns out that PT is a straight instance of GPT on the domain of state\npartitions for the case of strong preservation of Hennessy-Milner logic. We\nprovide a number of examples showing that GPT is of general use. We first show\nhow a well-known efficient algorithm for computing stuttering equivalence can\nbe viewed as a simple instance of GPT. We then instantiate GPT in order to\ndesign a new efficient algorithm for computing simulation equivalence that is\ncompetitive with the best available algorithms. Finally, we show how GPT allows\nto compute new strongly preserving abstract models by providing an efficient\nalgorithm that computes the coarsest refinement of a given partition that\nstrongly preserves the language generated by the reachability operator."

This is indeed the case\nwhen one interprets integers over the type (p->p)->p->p where p is a base type\nand/or equality is taken as beta-conversion. It is commonly believed that the\nsame holds for beta-eta equality and for integers represented over any fixed\ntype of the form (t->t)->t->t. In this paper we show that this opinion is not\nquite true.\n  We prove that the class of functions strictly definable in simply typed\nlambda-calculus is considerably larger than the extended polynomials. Namely,\nwe define F as the class of strictly definable functions and G as a class that\ncontains extended polynomials and two additional functions, or more precisely,\ntwo function schemas, and is closed under composition. We prove that G is a\nsubset of F.\n  We conjecture that G exactly characterizes strictly definable functions, i.e.\nG=F, and we gather some evidence for this conjecture proving, for example, that\nevery skewly representable finite range function is strictly representable over\n(t->t)->t->t for some t."

We extend the theorem of factorisation forest in two\ndirections: we show that it is still valid for any word indexed by a linear\nordering; and we show that it admits a deterministic variant for words indexed\nby well-orderings. A byproduct of this work is also an improvement on the known\nbounds for the original result.

Since the work of Buchi, regular languages have\nbeen classified according to their descriptive complexity, i.e. the type of\nlogical formalism required to define them. The algebraic point of view on\nautomata is an essential complement of this classification: by providing\nalternative, algebraic characterizations for the classes, it often yields the\nonly opportunity for the design of algorithms that decide expressibility in\nsome logical fragment.\n  We survey the existing results relating the expressibility of regular\nlanguages in logical fragments of MSO[S] with algebraic properties of their\nminimal automata. In particular, we show that many of the best known results in\nthis area share the same underlying mechanics and rely on a very strong\nrelation between logical substitutions and block-products of pseudovarieties of\nmonoid.

The best fit DL language appears to\nbe the ExpTime-complete DLRifd. To illustrate trade-offs and highlight features\nof the modelling languages, we present a precise transformation of the mappable\nfeatures of the very expressive (undecidable) ORM/ORM2 conceptual data\nmodelling languages to exactly DLRifd. Although not all ORM2 features can be\nmapped, this is an interesting fragment because it has been shown that DLRifd\ncan also encode UML Class Diagrams and EER, and therefore can foster\ninteroperation between conceptual data models and research into ontological\naspects of the modelling languages."

The earlier version of\nthis calculus provides a cumbersome encoding of substitution composition, an\noperation that is important to the efficient realization of reduction. This\nencoding is simplified here, resulting in a treatment that is easy to use\ndirectly in applications. The rationalization consists of the elimination of a\npractically inconsequential flexibility in the unravelling of substitutions\nthat has the inadvertent side effect of losing contextual information in terms;\nthe modified calculus now has a structure that naturally supports logical\nanalyses, such as ones related to the assignment of types, over lambda terms.\nThe overall calculus is shown to have pleasing theoretical properties such as a\nstrongly terminating sub-calculus for substitution and confluence even in the\npresence of term meta variables that are accorded a grafting interpretation.\nAnother contribution of the paper is the identification of a broad set of\nproperties that are desirable for explicit substitution calculi to support and\na classification of a variety of proposed systems based on these. The\nsuspension calculus is used as a tool in this study. In particular, mappings\nare described between it and the other calculi towards understanding the\ncharacteristics of the latter."

Here we elaborate\nthis result, and match the number of heads to the arity of the transitive\nclosure. More precisely, first-order logic with k-ary deterministic transitive\nclosure has the same power as deterministic automata walking on their input\nwith k heads, additionally using a finite set of nested pebbles. This result is\nvalid for strings, ordered trees, and in general for families of graphs having\na fixed automaton that can be used to traverse the nodes of each of the graphs\nin the family. Other examples of such families are grids, toruses, and\nrectangular mazes. For nondeterministic automata, the logic is restricted to\npositive occurrences of transitive closure.\n  The special case of k=1 for trees, shows that single-head deterministic\ntree-walking automata with nested pebbles are characterized by first-order\nlogic with unary deterministic transitive closure. This refines our earlier\nresult that placed these automata between first-order and monadic second-order\nlogic on trees."

This makes it a highly\nexpressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting\ncorrectness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal\n\\lambda-calculus.\n  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In\nparticular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of\nbounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness\nfor model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint\nelimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the\nsize of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying\ntransition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a\nsimple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression\ncomplexity of each such fragment.\n  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for\nalternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there\nare fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with\nrespect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold\nexponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,\nprovided m exceeds 3.

It is also\npossible to express properties such as disjointness of data-structures, and\nlow-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express properties of\narbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer fields.

Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference\nformula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that\nstep. Third, the resulting formula is checked for being a tautology or being\nunsatisfiable by a decision procedure for monadic difference logic.\n  We further provide a simple decision procedure for monadic difference logic\nbased on the data structure Difference Decision Diagrams. The algorithm is\ncomplete in a very strong sense on a subclass of temporal formulae\ncharacterized as homogeneously monadic and it is approximate on other formulae.\nThe approximation comes from the fact that not all unsatisfiable or\ntautological formulae are recognised at the earliest possible time of the\nruntime verification.\n  Contrary to existing approaches, the presented algorithms do not work by\nsyntactic rewriting but employ efficient decision structures which make them\napplicable in real applications within for instance business software."

    "summary": "Over the last 25 years, a lot of work has been done on seeking for decidable\nnon-regular extensions of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). Only recently, an\nexpressive extension of PDL, allowing visibly pushdown automata (VPAs) as a\nformalism to describe programs, was introduced and proven to have a\nsatisfiability problem complete for deterministic double exponential time.\nLately, the VPA formalism was extended to so called k-phase multi-stack visibly\npushdown automata (k-MVPAs). Similarly to VPAs, it has been shown that the\nlanguage of k-MVPAs have desirable effective closure properties and that the\nemptiness problem is decidable. On the occasion of introducing k-MVPAs, it has\nbeen asked whether the extension of PDL with k-MVPAs still leads to a decidable\nlogic. This question is answered negatively here. We prove that already for the\nextension of PDL with 2-phase MVPAs with two stacks satisfiability becomes\n\\Sigma_1^1-complete."

    "summary": "For many a natural deduction style logic there is a Hilbert-style logic that\nis equivalent to it in that it has the same theorems (i.e. valid judgements\nwith empty contexts). For intuitionistic logic, the axioms of the equivalent\nHilbert-style logic can be propositions which are also known as the types of\nthe combinators I, K and S. Hilbert-style versions of illative combinatory\nlogic have formulations with axioms that are actual type statements for I, K\nand S. As pure type systems (PTSs)are, in a sense, equivalent to systems of\nillative combinatory logic, it might be thought that Hilbert-style PTSs (HPTSs)\ncould be based in a similar way. This paper shows that some PTSs have very\ntrivial equivalent HPTSs, with only the axioms as theorems and that for many\nPTSs no equivalent HPTS can exist. Most commonly used PTSs belong to these two\nclasses. For some PTSs however, including lambda* and the PTS at the basis of\nthe proof assistant Coq, there is a nontrivial equivalent HPTS, with axioms\nthat are type statements for I, K and S."

In this paper, we investigate a new version of the calculus of\ninductive constructions which incorporates arbitrary decision procedures into\ndeduction via the conversion rule of the calculus. The novelty of the problem\nin the context of the calculus of inductive constructions lies in the fact that\nthe computation mechanism varies along proof-checking: goals are sent to the\ndecision procedure together with the set of user hypotheses available from the\ncurrent context. Our main result shows that this extension of the calculus of\nconstructions does not compromise its main properties: confluence, subject\nreduction, strong normalization and consistency are all preserved."

It is based on\ngeneral notions of sequential computational strategies and wittingly consistent\nnon-deterministic strategies introduced by the author in the seventies.\nAlthough these notions of strategies are old, the definition of the fully\nabstract models is new, in that it is given level-by-level in the finite type\nhierarchy. To prove full abstraction and non-dcpo domain theoretic properties\nof these models, a theory of computational strategies is developed. This is\nalso an alternative and, in a sense, an analogue to the later game strategy\nsemantics approaches of Abramsky, Jagadeesan, and Malacaria; Hyland and Ong;\nand Nickau. In both cases of PCF and PCF^+ there are definable universal\n(surjective) functionals from numerical functions to any given type,\nrespectively, which also makes each of these models unique up to isomorphism.\nAlthough such models are non-omega-complete and therefore not continuous in the\ntraditional terminology, they are also proved to be sequentially complete (a\nweakened form of omega-completeness), \"naturally\" continuous (with respect to\nexisting directed \"pointwise\", or \"natural\" lubs) and also \"naturally\"\nomega-algebraic and \"naturally\" bounded complete -- appropriate generalisation\nof the ordinary notions of domain theory to the case of non-dcpos."

    "summary": "This paper presents the design of a novel distributed algorithm d-IRA for the\nreachability analysis of linear hybrid automata. Recent work on iterative\nrelaxation abstraction (IRA) is leveraged to distribute the computational\nproblem among multiple computational nodes in a non-redundant manner by\nperforming careful infeasibility analysis of linear programs corresponding to\nspurious counterexamples. The d-IRA algorithm is resistant to failure of\nmultiple computational nodes. The experimental results provide promising\nevidence for the possible successful application of this technique."

Methods based on the validity of Quantified Boolean\nFormulae (QBF) allow an exponentially more succinct representation of formulae\nto be checked, because no \"unrolling\" of the transition relation is required.\nThese methods have not been widely used, because of the lack of an efficient\ndecision procedure for QBF. We evaluate the usage of QBF in bounded model\nchecking (BMC), using general-purpose SAT and QBF solvers.

The novelties of our verification\napproach are in a) combining EMM with proof-based abstraction that preserves\nthe correctness of a property up to a certain analysis depth of SAT-based BMC,\nand b) modeling arbitrary initial memory state precisely and thereby, providing\ninductive proofs using SAT-based BMC for embedded memory systems. Similar to\nthe previous approach, we construct a verification model by eliminating memory\narrays, but retaining the memory interface signals with their control logic and\nadding constraints on those signals at every analysis depth to preserve the\ndata forwarding semantics. The size of these EMM constraints depends\nquadratically on the number of memory accesses and the number of read and write\nports; and linearly on the address and data widths and the number of memories.\nWe show the effectiveness of our approach on several industry designs and\nsoftware programs."

To ensure the robustness of the don't-care\ncomputation for very large industrial networks, a optional windowing scheme is\nimplemented that computes substantial subsets of the CDCs in reasonable time.\nFinally, we give a SAT-based don't-care computation algorithm that is more\nefficient than BDD-based algorithms. Experimental results confirm that these\nimprovements work well in practice. Complete don't-cares allow for a reduction\nin the number of literals compared to the CODCs. Windowing guarantees\nrobustness, even for very large benchmarks on which previous methods could not\nbe applied. SAT reduces the runtime and enhances robustness, making don't-cares\naffordable for a variety of other Boolean methods applied to the network."

    "summary": "Formal verification techniques have been playing an important role in\npre-silicon validation processes. One of the most important points considered\nin performing formal verification is to define good verification scopes; we\nshould define clearly what to be verified formally upon designs under tests. We\nconsidered the following three practical requirements when we defined the scope\nof formal verification. They are (a) hard to verify (b) small to handle, and\n(c) easy to understand. Our novel approach is to break down generic properties\nfor system into stereotype properties in block level and to define requirements\nfor Verifiable RTL. Consequently, each designer instead of verification experts\ncan describe properties of the design easily, and formal model checking can be\napplied systematically and thoroughly to all the leaf modules. During the\ndevelopment of a component chip for server platforms, we focused on RAS\n(Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) features and described more\nthan 2000 properties in PSL. As a result of the formal verification, we found\nseveral critical logic bugs in a short time with limited resources, and\nsuccessfully verified all of them.

Applying this methodology the verification task starts as soon as\nthe functional specification is signed off and it runs in parallel to the\nmodels and design development. The verification environment is modeled with the\naid of dedicated verification languages and it is applied to both the models.\nThe test suite is exactly the same and thus it's possible to verify the\nalignment between the two models. In fact the final step is to check the\ncycle-by-cycle match of the interface behavior. A regression tool and a bus\nanalyzer have been developed to help the verification and the alignment\nprocess. The former is used to automate the testbench generation and to run the\ntwo test suites. The latter is used to verify the alignment between the two\nmodels comparing the waveforms obtained in each run. The quality metrics used\nto validate the flow are full functional coverage and full alignment at each IP\nport."

    "summary": "Formal verification using the model checking paradigm has to deal with two\naspects: The system models are structured, often as products of components, and\nthe specification logic has to be expressive enough to allow the formalization\nof reachability properties. The present paper is a study on what can be\nachieved for infinite transition systems under these premises. As models we\nconsider products of infinite transition systems with different synchronization\nconstraints. We introduce finitely synchronized transition systems, i.e.\nproduct systems which contain only finitely many (parameterized) synchronized\ntransitions, and show that the decidability of FO(R), first-order logic\nextended by reachability predicates, of the product system can be reduced to\nthe decidability of FO(R) of the components. This result is optimal in the\nfollowing sense: (1) If we allow semifinite synchronization, i.e. just in one\ncomponent infinitely many transitions are synchronized, the FO(R)-theory of the\nproduct system is in general undecidable. (2) We cannot extend the expressive\npower of the logic under consideration. Already a weak extension of first-order\nlogic with transitive closure, where we restrict the transitive closure\noperators to arity one and nesting depth two, is undecidable for an\nasynchronous (and hence finitely synchronized) product, namely for the infinite\ngrid."

    "summary": "Weak affine light typing (WALT) assigns light affine linear formulae as types\nto a subset of lambda-terms in System F. WALT is poly-time sound: if a\nlambda-term M has type in WALT, M can be evaluated with a polynomial cost in\nthe dimension of the derivation that gives it a type. In particular, the\nevaluation can proceed under any strategy of a rewriting relation, obtained as\na mix of both call-by-name/call-by-value beta-reductions. WALT is poly-time\ncomplete since it can represent any poly-time Turing machine. WALT weakens,\nnamely generalizes, the notion of stratification of deductions common to some\nLight Systems -- we call as such those logical systems, derived from Linear\nlogic, to characterize FP, the set of Polynomial functions -- . A weaker\nstratification allows to define a compositional embedding of the Quasi-linear\nfragment QlSRN of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. QlSRN is SRN,\nwhich is a recursive-theoretical system characterizing FP, where only the\ncomposition scheme is restricted to linear safe variables. So, the expressivity\nof WALT is stronger, as compared to the known Light Systems. In particular,\nusing the types, the embedding puts in evidence the stratification of normal\nand safe arguments hidden in QlSRN: the less an argument is impredicative, the\ndeeper, in a formal, proof-theoretical sense, gets its representation in WALT."

Our method is algorithmically\nefficient, with complexity polynomial in the number of component processes (of\nthe program) that are ``alive'' at any time. Our method does not explicitly\nconstruct the automata-theoretic product of all processes that are alive,\nthereby avoiding \\intr{state explosion}. Instead, for each pair of processes\nwhich interact, our method constructs an automata-theoretic product\n(\\intr{pair-machine}) which embodies all the possible interactions of these two\nprocesses. From each pair-machine, we can synthesize a correct\n\\intr{pair-program} which coordinates the two involved processes as needed. We\nallow such pair-programs to be added dynamically at run-time. They are then\n``composed conjunctively'' with the currently alive pair-programs to\nre-synthesize the program as it results after addition of the new pair-program.\nWe are thus able to add new behaviors, which result in new properties being\nsatisfied, at run-time. We establish a ``large model'' theorem which shows that\nthe synthesized large program inherits correctness properties from the\npair-programs."

    "summary": "Many semantical aspects of programming languages, such as their operational\nsemantics and their type assignment calculi, are specified by describing\nappropriate proof systems. Recent research has identified two proof-theoretic\nfeatures that allow direct, logic-based reasoning about such descriptions: the\ntreatment of atomic judgments as fixed points (recursive definitions) and an\nencoding of binding constructs via generic judgments. However, the logics\nencompassing these two features have thus far treated them orthogonally: that\nis, they do not provide the ability to define object-logic properties that\nthemselves depend on an intrinsic treatment of binding. We propose a new and\nsimple integration of these features within an intuitionistic logic enhanced\nwith induction over natural numbers and we show that the resulting logic is\nconsistent. The pivotal benefit of the integration is that it allows recursive\ndefinitions to not just encode simple, traditional forms of atomic judgments\nbut also to capture generic properties pertaining to such judgments. The\nusefulness of this logic is illustrated by showing how it can provide elegant\ntreatments of object-logic contexts that appear in proofs involving typing\ncalculi and of arbitrarily cascading substitutions that play a role in\nreducibility arguments."

WALT weakens, namely generalizes, the notion\nof \"stratification of deductions\", common to some Light Systems -- those\nlogical systems, derived from Linear logic, to characterize the set of\nPolynomial functions -- . A weaker stratification allows to define a\ncompositional embedding of Safe recursion on notation (SRN) into WALT. It turns\nout that the expressivity of WALT is strictly stronger than the one of the\nknown Light Systems. The embedding passes through the representation of a\nsubsystem of SRN. It is obtained by restricting the composition scheme of SRN\nto one that can only use its safe variables linearly. On one side, this\nsuggests that SRN, in fact, can be redefined in terms of more primitive\nconstructs. On the other, the embedding of SRN into WALT enjoys the two\nfollowing remarkable aspects. Every datatype, required by the embedding, is\nrepresented from scratch, showing the strong structural proof-theoretical roots\nof WALT. Moreover, the embedding highlights a stratification structure of the\nnormal and safe arguments, normally hidden inside the world of SRN-normal/safe\nvariables: the less an argument is \"polyomially impredicative\", the deeper, in\na formal, proof-theoretical sense, it is represented inside WALT. Finally,\nsince WALT is SRN-complete it is also polynomial-time complete since SRN is."

    "summary": "LF is a dependent type theory in which many other formal systems can be\nconveniently embedded. However, correct use of LF relies on nontrivial\nmetatheoretic developments such as proofs of correctness of decision procedures\nfor LF's judgments. Although detailed informal proofs of these properties have\nbeen published, they have not been formally verified in a theorem prover. We\nhave formalized these properties within Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype\nPackage, closely following a recent article by Harper and Pfenning. In the\nprocess, we identified and resolved a gap in one of the proofs and a small\nnumber of minor lacunae in others. We also formally derive a version of the\ntype checking algorithm from which Isabelle/HOL can generate executable code.\nBesides its intrinsic interest, our formalization provides a foundation for\nstudying the adequacy of LF encodings, the correctness of Twelf-style\nmetatheoretic reasoning, and the metatheory of extensions to LF."

They generalize\nboth pushdown (word) automata and the tree automata with constraints of\nequality between brothers of Bogaert and Tison. Though it has a decidable\nemptiness problem, the main weakness of this model is its lack of good closure\nproperties.\n  We propose a generalization of the visibly pushdown automata of Alur and\nMadhusudan to a family of tree recognizers which carry along their (bottom-up)\ncomputation an auxiliary unbounded memory with a tree structure (instead of a\nsymbol stack). In other words, these recognizers, called Visibly Tree Automata\nwith Memory (VTAM) define a subclass of tree automata with one memory enjoying\nBoolean closure properties. We show in particular that they can be determinized\nand the problems like emptiness, membership, inclusion and universality are\ndecidable for VTAM. Moreover, we propose several extensions of VTAM whose\ntransitions may be constrained by different kinds of tests between memories and\nalso constraints a la Bogaert and Tison comparing brother subtrees in the tree\nin input. We show that some of these classes of constrained VTAM keep the good\nclosure and decidability properties, and we demonstrate their expressiveness\nwith relevant examples of tree languages."

The technique relies on the reduction, under\nreasonable assumptions, of the continuous-time verification problem to its\ndiscrete-time counterpart. This reconciles in a viable and effective way the\ndense/discrete and operational/descriptive dichotomies that are often\nencountered in practice when it comes to specifying and analyzing complex\ncritical systems. The article investigates the applicability of the technique\nthrough a significant example centered on a communication protocol. More\nprecisely, concurrent runs of the protocol are formalized by parallel instances\nof a Timed Automaton, while the synchronization rules between these instances\nare specified through Metric Temporal Logic formulas, thus creating a\nmulti-paradigm model. Verification tests run on this model using a bounded\nvalidity checker implementing the technique show consistent results and\ninteresting performances."

    "summary": "Strong and weak simulation relations have been proposed for Markov chains,\nwhile strong simulation and strong probabilistic simulation relations have been\nproposed for probabilistic automata. However, decision algorithms for strong\nand weak simulation over Markov chains, and for strong simulation over\nprobabilistic automata are not efficient, which makes it as yet unclear whether\nthey can be used as effectively as their non-probabilistic counterparts. This\npaper presents drastically improved algorithms to decide whether some\n(discrete- or continuous-time) Markov chain strongly or weakly simulates\nanother, or whether a probabilistic automaton strongly simulates another. The\nkey innovation is the use of parametric maximum flow techniques to amortize\ncomputations. We also present a novel algorithm for deciding strong\nprobabilistic simulation preorders on probabilistic automata, which has\npolynomial complexity via a reduction to an LP problem. When extending the\nalgorithms for probabilistic automata to their continuous-time counterpart, we\nretain the same complexity for both strong and strong probabilistic\nsimulations."

In\nparticular bounded subsets of context-free languages have nice structural and\ndecidability properties. Our proof proceeds in two parts. First, using Newton's\niterations on the language semiring, we construct a context-free subset Ls of L\nthat can be represented as a sequence of substitutions on a linear language and\nhas the same Parikh image as L. Second, we inductively construct a\nParikh-equivalent bounded context-free subset of Ls.\n  We show two applications of this result in model checking: to\nunderapproximate the reachable state space of multithreaded procedural programs\nand to underapproximate the reachable state space of recursive counter\nprograms. The bounded language constructed above provides a decidable\nunderapproximation for the original problems. By iterating the construction, we\nget a semi-algorithm for the original problems that constructs a sequence of\nunderapproximations such that no two underapproximations of the sequence can be\ncompared. This provides a progress guarantee: every word w in L is in some\nunderapproximation of the sequence.

Computing such a regular representation of,\nsay, the set of reachable states of a system requires acceleration techniques\nthat can finitely compute the effect of an unbounded number of transitions.\nAmong the acceleration techniques that have been proposed, one finds both\nspecific and generic techniques. Specific techniques exploit the particular\ntype of system being analyzed, e.g. a system manipulating queues or integers,\nwhereas generic techniques only assume that the transition relation is\nrepresented by a finite-state transducer, which has to be iterated. In this\npaper, we investigate the possibility of using generic techniques in cases\nwhere only specific techniques have been exploited so far.

In this way we have covered many of\nthe standard theorems of bisimulation equivalence and congruence, both late and\nearly, and both strong and weak in a uniform manner. We thus provide one of the\nmost extensive formalisations of a process calculus ever done inside a theorem\nprover.\n  A significant gain in our formulation is that agents are identified up to\nalpha-equivalence, thereby greatly reducing the arguments about bound names.\nThis is a normal strategy for manual proofs about the pi-calculus, but that\nkind of hand waving has previously been difficult to incorporate smoothly in an\ninteractive theorem prover. We show how the nominal logic formalism and its\nsupport in Isabelle accomplishes this and thus significantly reduces the tedium\nof conducting completely formal proofs.

    "summary": "Nested words are a structured model of execution paths in procedural\nprograms, reflecting their call and return nesting structure. Finite nested\nwords also capture the structure of parse trees and other tree-structured data,\nsuch as XML. We provide new temporal logics for finite and infinite nested\nwords, which are natural extensions of LTL, and prove that these logics are\nfirst-order expressively-complete. One of them is based on adding a \"within\"\nmodality, evaluating a formula on a subword, to a logic CaRet previously\nstudied in the context of verifying properties of recursive state machines\n(RSMs). The other logic, NWTL, is based on the notion of a summary path that\nuses both the linear and nesting structures. For NWTL we show that\nsatisfiability is EXPTIME-complete, and that model-checking can be done in time\npolynomial in the size of the RSM model and exponential in the size of the NWTL\nformula (and is also EXPTIME-complete). Finally, we prove that first-order\nlogic over nested words has the three-variable property, and we present a\ntemporal logic for nested words which is complete for the two-variable fragment\nof first-order."

    "summary": "Visibly pushdown automata are input-driven pushdown automata that recognize\nsome non-regular context-free languages while preserving the nice closure and\ndecidability properties of finite automata. Visibly pushdown automata with\nmultiple stacks have been considered recently by La Torre, Madhusudan, and\nParlato, who exploit the concept of visibility further to obtain a rich\nautomata class that can even express properties beyond the class of\ncontext-free languages. At the same time, their automata are closed under\nboolean operations, have a decidable emptiness and inclusion problem, and enjoy\na logical characterization in terms of a monadic second-order logic over words\nwith an additional nesting structure. These results require a restricted\nversion of visibly pushdown automata with multiple stacks whose behavior can be\nsplit up into a fixed number of phases. In this paper, we consider 2-stack\nvisibly pushdown automata (i.e., visibly pushdown automata with two stacks) in\ntheir unrestricted form. We show that they are expressively equivalent to the\nexistential fragment of monadic second-order logic. Furthermore, it turns out\nthat monadic second-order quantifier alternation forms an infinite hierarchy\nwrt words with multiple nestings. Combining these results, we conclude that\n2-stack visibly pushdown automata are not closed under complementation.\nFinally, we discuss the expressive power of B\\\"{u}chi 2-stack visibly pushdown\nautomata running on infinite (nested) words. Extending the logic by an infinity\nquantifier, we can likewise establish equivalence to existential monadic\nsecond-order logic."

In coalgebraic terms, a neighbourhood frame is a\ncoalgebra for the contravariant powerset functor composed with itself, denoted\nby 2^2. We use this coalgebraic modelling to derive notions of equivalence\nbetween neighbourhood structures. 2^2-bisimilarity and behavioural equivalence\nare well known coalgebraic concepts, and they are distinct, since 2^2 does not\npreserve weak pullbacks. We introduce a third, intermediate notion whose\nwitnessing relations we call precocongruences (based on pushouts). We give\nback-and-forth style characterisations for 2^2-bisimulations and\nprecocongruences, we show that on a single coalgebra, precocongruences capture\nbehavioural equivalence, and that between neighbourhood structures,\nprecocongruences are a better approximation of behavioural equivalence than\n2^2-bisimulations. We also introduce a notion of modal saturation for\nneighbourhood models, and investigate its relationship with definability and\nimage-finiteness. We prove a Hennessy-Milner theorem for modally saturated and\nfor image-finite neighbourhood models.

While the canonical\nmodel construction is well understood for Kripke semantics, non-normal modal\nlogics often present subtle difficulties - up to the point that canonical\nmodels may fail to exist, as is the case e.g. in most probabilistic logics.\nHere, we present a generic canonical model construction in the semantic\nframework of coalgebraic modal logic, which pinpoints coherence conditions\nbetween syntax and semantics of modal logics that guarantee strong\ncompleteness. We apply this method to reconstruct canonical model theorems that\nare either known or folklore, and moreover instantiate our method to obtain new\nstrong completeness results. In particular, we prove strong completeness of\ngraded modal logic with finite multiplicities, and of the modal logic of exact\nprobabilities."

Vojtas, and hedge\nalgebras in order to facilitate the representation and reasoning on human\nknowledge expressed in natural languages. In fuzzy linguistic logic\nprogramming, truth values are linguistic ones, e.g., VeryTrue,\nVeryProbablyTrue, and LittleFalse, taken from a hedge algebra of a linguistic\ntruth variable, and linguistic hedges (modifiers) can be used as unary\nconnectives in formulae. This is motivated by the fact that humans reason\nmostly in terms of linguistic terms rather than in terms of numbers, and\nlinguistic hedges are often used in natural languages to express different\nlevels of emphasis. The paper presents: (i) the language of fuzzy linguistic\nlogic programming; (ii) a declarative semantics in terms of Herbrand\ninterpretations and models; (iii) a procedural semantics which directly\nmanipulates linguistic terms to compute a lower bound to the truth value of a\nquery, and proves its soundness; (iv) a fixpoint semantics of logic programs,\nand based on it, proves the completeness of the procedural semantics; (v)\nseveral applications of fuzzy linguistic logic programming; and (vi) an idea of\nimplementing a system to execute fuzzy linguistic logic programs."

Since reception orders are in general indeterminate, they cannot\nbe inferred from prior information by mathematical logic alone. Therefore\nmathematical logic cannot in general implement computation.\n  Over the course of history, the term \"Functional Program\" has grown more\nprecise and technical as the field has matured. \"Logic Program\" should be on a\nsimilar trajectory. Accordingly, \"Logic Program\" should have a general precise\ncharacterization. In the fall of 1972, different characterizations of Logic\nPrograms that have continued to this day:\n  * A Logic Program uses Horn-Clause syntax for forward and backward chaining\n  * Each computational step (according to Actor Model) of a Logic Program is\ndeductively inferred (e.g. in Direct Logic).\n  The above examples are illustrative of how issues of inconsistency robustness\nhave repeatedly arisen in Logic Programs."

In the case of infinite words, the value of a\nrun is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit average, or\ndiscounted sum of the transition weights. We study expressiveness and closure\nquestions about these quantitative languages.\n  We first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold can\nbe non-$\\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sum\nautomata, while this set is always $\\omega$-regular when the threshold is\nisolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word). In\nthe latter case, we prove that the $\\omega$-regular language is robust against\nsmall perturbations of the transition weights.\n  We next consider automata with transition weights 0 or 1 and show that they\nare as expressive as general weighted automata in the limit-average case, but\nnot in the discounted-sum case.\n  Third, for quantitative languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, we consider the operations\n$\\max(L_1,L_2)$, $\\min(L_1,L_2)$, and $1-L_1$, which generalize the boolean\noperations on languages, as well as the sum $L_1 + L_2$.

    "summary": "In computer science, various logical languages are defined to analyze\nproperties of systems. One way to pinpoint the essential differences between\nthose logics is to compare their expressivity in terms of distinguishing power\nand expressive power. In this paper, we study those two concepts by regarding\nthe latter notion as the former lifted to classes of models. We show some\ngeneral results on lifting an invariance relation on models to one on classes\nof models, such that when the former corresponds to the distinguishing power of\na logic, the latter corresponds to its expressive power, given certain\ncompactness requirements. In particular, we introduce the notion of class\nbisimulation to capture the expressive power of modal logics. We demonstrate\nthe application of our results by revisiting modal definability with our new\ninsights."

More abstractly, the set of possible outcomes\nfor tests forms a semiring, and the set of process interpretations appears as a\nmodule over this semiring, in which basic syntactic constructs are affine\noperators.

    "summary": "A central paradigm behind process semantics based on observability and\ntesting is that the exact moment of occurring of an internal nondeterministic\nchoice is unobservable. It is natural, therefore, for this property to hold\nwhen the internal choice is quantified with probabilities. However, ever since\nprobabilities have been introduced in process semantics, it has been a\nchallenge to preserve the unobservability of the random choice, while not\nviolating the other laws of process theory and probability theory. This paper\naddresses this problem. It proposes two semantics for processes where the\ninternal nondeterminism has been quantified with probabilities. The first one\nis based on the notion of testing, i.e. interaction between the process and its\nenvironment. The second one, the probabilistic ready trace semantics, is based\non the notion of observability. Both are shown to coincide. They are also\npreserved under the standard operators."

Since many true concurrency semantics are congruent w.r.t.\naction refinement, notably the causality and the maximality ones, this has\nchallenged us to study the dense time behavior - where the actions are of\narbitrary fixed duration - within the causality semantics of Da Costa.\n  We extend the causal transition systems with the clocks and the timed\nconstraints, and thus we obtain an over class of timed automata where the\nactions need not to be atomic. We define a real time extension of the formal\ndescription technique CSP, called duration-CSP, by attributing the duration to\nactions. We give the operational timed causal semantics of duration-CSP as well\nas its denotational semantics over the class of timed causal transition\nsystems.

    "summary": "Complex systems typically have many different parts and facets, with\ndifferent characteristics. In a multi-paradigm approach to modeling, formalisms\nwith different natures are used in combination to describe complementary parts\nand aspects of the system. This can have a beneficial impact on the modeling\nactivity, as different paradigms an be better suited to describe different\naspects of the system. While each paradigm provides a different view on the\nmany facets of the system, it is of paramount importance that a coherent\ncomprehensive model emerges from the combination of the various partial\ndescriptions. In this paper we present a technique to model different aspects\nof the same system with different formalisms, while keeping the various models\ntightly integrated with one another. In addition, our approach leverages the\nflexibility provided by a bounded satisfiability checker to encode the\nverification problem of the integrated model in the propositional\nsatisfiability (SAT) problem; this allows users to carry out formal\nverification activities both on the whole model and on parts thereof.

    "summary": "We consider problems of access control for update of XML documents. In the\ncontext of XML programming, types can be viewed as hedge automata, and static\ntype checking amounts to verify that a program always converts valid source\ndocuments into also valid output documents. Given a set of update operations we\nare particularly interested by checking safety properties such as preservation\nof document types along any sequence of updates. We are also interested by the\nrelated policy consistency problem, that is detecting whether a sequence of\nauthorized operations can simulate a forbidden one. We reduce these questions\nto type checking problems, solved by computing variants of hedge automata\ncharacterizing the set of ancestors and descendants of the initial document\ntype for the closure of parameterized rewrite rules."

A standard formulation for this semantics is the CRWL logic, that\nspecifies a proof calculus for computing the set of possible results for each\nexpression. In this paper we present a formalization of that calculus in the\nIsabelle/HOL proof assistant.

    "summary": "Recursive relational specifications are commonly used to describe the\ncomputational structure of formal systems. Recent research in proof theory has\nidentified two features that facilitate direct, logic-based reasoning about\nsuch descriptions: the interpretation of atomic judgments through recursive\ndefinitions and an encoding of binding constructs via generic judgments.\nHowever, logics encompassing these two features do not currently allow for the\ndefinition of relations that embody dynamic aspects related to binding, a\ncapability needed in many reasoning tasks. We propose a new relation between\nterms called nominal abstraction as a means for overcoming this deficiency. We\nincorporate nominal abstraction into a rich logic also including definitions,\ngeneric quantification, induction, and co-induction that we then prove to be\nconsistent. We present examples to show that this logic can provide elegant\ntreatments of binding contexts that appear in many proofs, such as those\nestablishing properties of typing calculi and of arbitrarily cascading\nsubstitutions that play a role in reducibility arguments."

    "summary": "Metric coinduction is a form of coinduction that can be used to establish\nproperties of objects constructed as a limit of finite approximations. One can\nprove a coinduction step showing that some property is preserved by one step of\nthe approximation process, then automatically infer by the coinduction\nprinciple that the property holds of the limit object. This can often be used\nto avoid complicated analytic arguments involving limits and convergence,\nreplacing them with simpler algebraic arguments.

Our goal is to address the issue\nof inexact synchronisation in a process algebra setting, because we get\nconcepts like modularity and abstraction for free, which are useful to further\nanalyze the synthesised system. In this paper, we propose four methods to check\na closed loop system in an asynchronous setting such that it is branching\nbisimilar to the modified (asynchronous) closed loop system. We modify a given\nclosed loop system by introducing buffers either in the plant models, the\nsupervisor models, or the output channels of both supervisor and plant models,\nor in the input channels of both supervisor and plant models. A notion of\ndesynchronisable closed loop system is introduced, which is a class of\nsynchronous closed loop systems such that they are branching bisimilar to their\ncorresponding asynchronous versions. Finally we study different case studies in\nan asynchronous setting and then try to summarise the observations (or\nconditions) which will be helpful in order to formulate a theory of\ndesynchronisable closed loop systems."

    "summary": "Until is a notoriously difficult temporal operator as it is both existential\nand universal at the same time: A until B holds at the current time instant w\niff either B holds at w or there exists a time instant w' in the future at\nwhich B holds and such that A holds in all the time instants between the\ncurrent one and w'. This \"ambivalent\" nature poses a significant challenge when\nattempting to give deduction rules for until. In this paper, in contrast, we\nmake explicit this duality of until to provide well-behaved natural deduction\nrules for linear-time logics by introducing a new temporal operator that allows\nus to formalize the \"history\" of until, i.e., the \"internal\" universal\nquantification over the time instants between the current one and w'. This\napproach provides the basis for formalizing deduction systems for temporal\nlogics endowed with the until operator. For concreteness, we give here a\nlabeled natural deduction system for a linear-time logic endowed with the new\noperator and show that, via a proper translation, such a system is also sound\nand complete with respect to the linear temporal logic LTL with until."

The argument in our paper is\nbased on an example: we show that two seemingly dissimilar algorithms have a\ncommon set of high-level properties, which reveals their affinity. The\nalgorithms are a variant of Lamport's Bakery Algorithm and the Ricart and\nAgrawala algorithm. They seem different because one uses shared memory and the\nother message passing for communication. Yet it is intuitively obvious that\nthey are in some sense very similar, and they belong to the same \"family of\nBakery Algorithms\". The aim of this paper is to express in a formal way this\nintuition that classifies the two algorithms together. For this aim of\nexpressing the abstract high level properties that are shared by the two\nalgorithms we use predicate languages and their Taskian structures. We find a\nset of properties expressed in quantification language which are satisfied by\nevery Tarskian system execution that models a run by either one of the\nprotocols, and which is strong enough to ensure that the mutual exclusion\nproperty holds in these runs."

A system\nprototype implementing NP Datalog is presented. The system translates NP\nDatalog queries into OPL programs which are executed by the ILOG OPL\nDevelopment Studio. Our proposal combines easy formulation of problems,\nexpressed by means of a declarative logic language, with the efficiency of the\nILOG System. Several experiments show the effectiveness of this approach."

    "summary": "In computer science, there is a distinction between closed systems, whose\nbehavior is totally determined in advance, and open systems, that are systems\nmaintaining a constant interaction with an unspecified environment. Closed\nsystems are naturally modeled by transitions systems. Open systems have been\nmodeled in various ways, including process algebras, I/O automata, ``modules'',\nand interfaces. Games provide a uniform setting in which all these models can\nbe cast and compared. In this paper, we discuss the features and costs related\nto the game-based approach to open systems, referring to some of the existing\nmodels. Finally, we describe a new model of interface, called sociable\ninterface, which is geared towards easier specification, improved reusability\nof models, and efficient symbolic implementation."

    "summary": "We tackle the problem of graph transformation with a particular focus on node\ncloning. We propose a new approach to graph rewriting where nodes can be cloned\nzero, one or more times. A node can be cloned together with all its incident\nedges, with only its outgoing edges, with only its incoming edges or with none\nof its incident edges. We thus subsume previous works such as the\nsesqui-pushout, the heterogeneous pushout and the adaptive star grammars\napproaches. A rewrite rule is defined as a span where the right-hand and\nleft-hand sides are graphs while the interface is a polarized graph. A\npolarized graph is a graph endowed with some annotations on nodes. The way a\nnode is cloned is indicated by its polarization annotation. We use these\nannotations for designing graph transformation with polarized cloning. We show\nhow a clone of a node can be built according to the different possible\npolarizations and define a rewrite step as a final pullback complement followed\nby a pushout. This is called the polarized sesqui-pushout approach. We also\nprovide an algorithmic presentation of the proposed graph transformation with\npolarized cloning."

Underlying our approach is an engine performing\n(partial) constraint satisfaction of the sets of constraints. Our model extends\nprevious work on three counts: firstly, a more advanced notion of external\ninteraction is offered; secondly, our approach enables local satisfaction of\nconstraints with appropriate partial solutions, avoiding global synchronisation\nover the entire constraints set; and, as a consequence, constraint satisfaction\ncan finally occur concurrently, and multiple parts of a set of constraints can\nbe solved and interact with the outside world in an asynchronous manner, unless\nsynchronisation is required by the constraints. This paper describes the\nunderlying logic, which enables a notion of local solution, and relates this\nlogic to the more global approach of our previous work based on classical\nlogic."

While the structure of connectors resembles hypergraphs, their\nsemantics is given in terms of so-called port automata. We define both models\nin a categorical setting where composition operations can be elegantly defined\nand integrated. Specifically, we formalize structural gluings of connectors as\npushouts, and joins of port automata as pullbacks.

The reason is that the proposed application of CTL-X to\nnon-total Kripke structures lacks the expressiveness to cope with deadlock\nproperties that are important in the context of parallel composition. We\npropose an extension of CTL-X, or an alternative treatment of non-totality,\nthat fills this hiatus.

First, the Logic for Partial Function (LPF) used by VDM is\nextended to specify memory access using pointers and memory layout of composite\ntypes. Then, the concepts of data-retrieve functions (DRF) and memory-scope\nfunctions (MSF) are introduced in this paper. People can define DRFs to\nretrieve abstract values from interconnected concrete data objects. The\ndefinition of the corresponding MSF of a DRF can be derived syntactically from\nthe definition of the DRF. This MSF computes the set of memory units accessed\nwhen the DRF retrieves an abstract value. This memory unit set is called the\nmemory scope of the abstract value. Finally, the proof rule of assignment\nstatements in Hoare's logic is modified to deal with pointers. The basic idea\nis that a virtual value keeps unmodified as long as no memory unit in its scope\nis over-written. Another proof rule is added for memory allocation statements.\nThe consequence rule and the rules for control-flow statements are slightly\nmodified. They are essentially same as their original version in Hoare logic.\n  An example is presented to show the efficacy of this logic. We also give some\nheuristics on how to verify pointer programs."

    "summary": "We present a first-order theory of sequences with integer elements,\nPresburger arithmetic, and regular constraints, which can model significant\nproperties of data structures such as arrays and lists. We give a decision\nprocedure for the quantifier-free fragment, based on an encoding into the\nfirst-order theory of concatenation; the procedure has PSPACE complexity. The\nquantifier-free fragment of the theory of sequences can express properties such\nas sortedness and injectivity, as well as Boolean combinations of periodic and\narithmetic facts relating the elements of the sequence and their positions\n(e.g., \"for all even i's, the element at position i has value i+3 or 2i\"). The\nresulting expressive power is orthogonal to that of the most expressive\ndecidable logics for arrays. Some examples demonstrate that the fragment is\nalso suitable to reason about sequence-manipulating programs within the\nstandard framework of axiomatic semantics."

However, this process consumes significant\ntime and needs a lot of effort. An alternative is to use formal specification\nlanguage as a high-level hardware description language and synthesize hardware\nfrom formal specification. Bloem et.al. gave formal specifications and\nsynthesize the AMBA AHB Arbiter. Our contributions are as follows:(1) We\npresent more complete and compact formal specifications for the AMBA AHB\nArbiter, and obtain significant (order of magnitude) improvement in synthesis\nresults (both with respect to time and the number of gates of the synthesize\ncircuit); (2) we present formal specification and synthesize to generate\ncompact circuits for the remaining two components of the AMBA AHB protocol,\nnamely, the AMBA AHB Master and AMBA AHB Slave; and (3) from the lessons learnt\nwe present few principles for writing formal specifications for efficient\nhardware synthesis. Thus with intelligently written complete formal\nspecifications we are able to automatically synthesize an important and widely\nused industrial protocol."

The good properties\nof this translation wrt. beta-reduction were guaranteed by a coherence relation\non resource terms: normalization is \"linear and stable\" (in the sense of the\ncoherence space semantics of linear logic) wrt. this coherence relation. Such\ncoherence properties are lost when one considers non-deterministic or algebraic\nextensions of the lambda-calculus (the algebraic lambda-calculus is an\nextension of the lambda-calculus where terms can be linearly combined).

In particular we analyze the relationships among this novel\napproach and the commonly used notion of context-sensitivity in term rewriting,\nas well as the feasibility of rewriting with forbidden patterns from a\ncomputational point of view.

Refinement is\naccomplished by mapping all of the elements of an upper level specification\ninto lower level elements that may be split among several parallel components.\nIn addition, actions that can occur in the upper level are mapped to actions of\ncomponents operating at the lower level. This allows several types of\nimplementation strategies to be specified in a natural way, while the price for\ngenerality (in terms of complexity) is paid only when necessary.

    "summary": "Fixed point combinators (and their generalization: looping combinators) are\nclassic notions belonging to the heart of lambda-calculus and logic. We start\nwith an exploration of the structure of fixed point combinators (fpc's), vastly\ngeneralizing the well-known fact that if Y is an fpc, Y(SI) is again an fpc,\ngenerating the Boehm sequence of fpc's. Using the infinitary lambda-calculus we\ndevise infinitely many other generation schemes for fpc's. In this way we find\nschemes and building blocks to construct new fpc's in a modular way.\n  Having created a plethora of new fixed point combinators, the task is to\nprove that they are indeed new. That is, we have to prove their\nbeta-inconvertibility. Known techniques via Boehm Trees do not apply, because\nall fpc's have the same Boehm Tree (BT). Therefore, we employ `clocked BT's',\nwith annotations that convey information of the tempo in which the data in the\nBT are produced. BT's are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour,\nleading to a refined discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding\nequality is strictly intermediate between beta-convertibility and BT-equality,\nthe equality in the classical models of lambda-calculus. An analogous approach\npertains to Levy-Longo Berarducci trees. Finally, we increase the\ndiscrimination power by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic\nclock'."

RSs proved a flexible specification\ndevice, yet so far most of the efforts dealing with their behavioural semantics\nfocused on idem pushouts (IPOs) and saturated (also known as dynamic)\nbisimulations. In this paper we introduce a novel, intermediate behavioural\nequivalence: L-bisimilarity, which is able to recast both its IPO and saturated\ncounterparts. The equivalence is parametric with respect to a set L of RSs\nlabels, and it is shown that under mild conditions on L it is indeed a\ncongruence. Furthermore, L-bisimilarity can also recast the notion of barbed\nsemantics for RSs, proposed by the same authors in a previous paper.

    "summary": "There is a growing interest in techniques for detecting whether a logic\nspecification is satisfied too easily, or vacuously. For example, the\nspecification \"every request is eventually followed by an acknowledgment\" is\nsatisfied vacuously by a system that never generates any requests. Vacuous\nsatisfaction misleads users of model-checking into thinking that a system is\ncorrect.\n  There are several existing definitions of vacuity. Originally, Beer et al.\nformalized vacuity as insensitivity to syntactic perturbation. However, this\ndefinition is only reasonable for vacuity in a single occurrence. Armoni et al.\nargued that vacuity must be robust -- not affected by semantically invariant\nchanges, such as extending a model with additional atomic propositions. They\nshow that syntactic vacuity is not robust for LTL, and propose an alternative\ndefinition -- trace vacuity.\n  In this article, we continue this line of research. We show that trace\nvacuity is not robust for branching time logic. We refine it to apply uniformly\nto linear and branching time logic and to not suffer from the common pitfalls\nof prior definitions. Our new definition -- bisimulation vacuity -- is a proper\nnon-trivial extension of both syntactic and trace vacuity. We discuss the\ncomplexity of detecting bisimulation vacuity, and give efficient algorithms to\ndetect vacuity for several practically-relevant subsets of CTL*."

    "summary": "Term unification plays an important role in many areas of computer science,\nespecially in those related to logic. The universal mechanism of grammar-based\ncompression for terms, in particular the so-called Singleton Tree Grammars\n(STG), have recently drawn considerable attention. Using STGs, terms of\nexponential size and height can be represented in linear space. Furthermore,\nthe term representation by directed acyclic graphs (dags) can be efficiently\nsimulated. The present paper is the result of an investigation on term\nunification and matching when the terms given as input are represented using\ndifferent compression mechanisms for terms such as dags and Singleton Tree\nGrammars. We describe a polynomial time algorithm for context matching with\ndags, when the number of different context variables is fixed for the problem.\nFor the same problem, NP-completeness is obtained when the terms are\nrepresented using the more general formalism of Singleton Tree Grammars. For\nfirst-order unification and matching polynomial time algorithms are presented,\neach of them improving previous results for those problems."

    "summary": "Classical logics of knowledge and belief are usually interpreted on Kripke\nmodels, for which a mathematically well-developed model theory is available.\nHowever, such models are inadequate to capture dynamic phenomena. Therefore,\nepistemic plausibility models have been introduced. Because these are much\nricher structures than Kripke models, they do not straightforwardly inherit the\nmodel-theoretical results of modal logic. Therefore, while epistemic\nplausibility structures are well-suited for modeling purposes, an extensive\ninvestigation of their model theory has been lacking so far. The aim of the\npresent paper is to fill exactly this gap, by initiating a systematic\nexploration of the model theory of epistemic plausibility models. Like in\n'ordinary' modal logic, the focus will be on the notion of bisimulation. We\ndefine various notions of bisimulations (parametrized by a language L) and show\nthat L-bisimilarity implies L-equivalence. We prove a Hennesy-Milner type\nresult, and also two undefinability results. However, our main point is a\nnegative one, viz. that bisimulations cannot straightforwardly be generalized\nto epistemic plausibility models if conditional belief is taken into account.\nWe present two ways of coping with this issue: (i) adding a modality to the\nlanguage, and (ii) putting extra constraints on the models. Finally, we make\nsome remarks about the interaction between bisimulation and dynamic model\nchanges."

Used as proof assistants, one of the advantages of\nsuch powerful systems resides in their responsiveness to extensibility of their\nreasoning capabilities, being designed over rule-based programming languages\nthat allow the user to build her own `programs to construct proofs' - the\nso-called proof tactics.\n  The present contribution discusses the implementation of an algorithm that\ngenerates sound and complete tableau systems for a very inclusive class of\nsufficiently expressive finite-valued propositional logics, and then\nillustrates some of the challenges and difficulties related to the algorithmic\nformation of automated theorem proving tactics for such logics. The procedure\non whose implementation we will report is based on a generalized notion of\nanalyticity of proof systems that is intended to guarantee termination of the\ncorresponding automated tactics on what concerns theoremhood in our targeted\nlogics."

    "summary": "The tree automaton completion is an algorithm used for proving safety\nproperties of systems that can be modeled by a term rewriting system. This\nrepresentation and verification technique works well for proving properties of\ninfinite systems like cryptographic protocols or more recently on Java Bytecode\nprograms. This algorithm computes a tree automaton which represents a (regular)\nover approximation of the set of reachable terms by rewriting initial terms.\nThis approach is limited by the lack of information about rewriting relation\nbetween terms. Actually, terms in relation by rewriting are in the same\nequivalence class: there are recognized by the same state in the tree\nautomaton.\n  Our objective is to produce an automaton embedding an abstraction of the\nrewriting relation sufficient to prove temporal properties of the term\nrewriting system.\n  We propose to extend the algorithm to produce an automaton having more\nequivalence classes to distinguish a term or a subterm from its successors\nw.r.t. rewriting. While ground transitions are used to recognize equivalence\nclasses of terms, epsilon-transitions represent the rewriting relation between\nterms. From the completed automaton, it is possible to automatically build a\nKripke structure abstracting the rewriting sequence. States of the Kripke\nstructure are states of the tree automaton and the transition relation is given\nby the set of epsilon-transitions. States of the Kripke structure are labelled\nby the set of terms recognized using ground transitions. On this Kripke\nstructure, we define the Regular Linear Temporal Logic (R-LTL) for expressing\nproperties. Such properties can then be checked using standard model checking\nalgorithms. The only difference between LTL and R-LTL is that predicates are\nreplaced by regular sets of acceptable terms."

    "summary": "Nominal abstract syntax and higher-order abstract syntax provide a means for\ndescribing binding structure which is higher-level than traditional techniques.\nThese approaches have spawned two different communities which have developed\nalong similar lines but with subtle differences that make them difficult to\nrelate. The nominal abstract syntax community has devices like names,\nfreshness, name-abstractions with variable capture, and the new-quantifier,\nwhereas the higher-order abstract syntax community has devices like\nlambda-binders, lambda-conversion, raising, and the nabla-quantifier. This\npaper aims to unify these communities and provide a concrete correspondence\nbetween their different devices. In particular, we develop a\nsemantics-preserving translation from alpha-Prolog, a nominal abstract syntax\nbased logic programming language, to G-, a higher-order abstract syntax based\nlogic programming language. We also discuss higher-order judgments, a common\nand powerful tool for specifications with higher-order abstract syntax, and we\nshow how these can be incorporated into G-.

    "summary": "Modal fixpoint logics traditionally play a central role in computer science,\nin particular in artificial intelligence and concurrency. The mu-calculus and\nits relatives are among the most expressive logics of this type. However,\npopular fixpoint logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and\nreadability, and in fact often live within the single variable fragment of the\nmu-calculus. The family of such flat fixpoint logics includes, e.g., LTL, CTL,\nand the logic of common knowledge. Extending this notion to the generic\nsemantic framework of coalgebraic logic enables covering a wide range of logics\nbeyond the standard mu-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the graded\nmu-calculus and the alternating-time mu-calculus (such as alternating-time\ntemporal logic ATL), as well as probabilistic and monotone fixpoint logics. We\ngive a generic proof of completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization for such\nflat coalgebraic fixpoint logics."

The traditional techniques (like model checking) do not\nscale; since they include the whole state-space by inlining the library\nfunction codes. Current research avoids these problem by creating a lightweight\nrepresentation of the library in form of an \"interface graph\" (call sequence\ngraph). In this paper we introduce a new algorithm to compute a safe,\npermissive interface graph for C-type functions. In this modular analysis, each\nfunction transition is summarized following three-valued abstraction semantics.\nThere are two kinds of abstraction used here. The global abstraction contains\npredicates over global variables only; however the local abstraction inside\neach function may also contain the local variables. The abstract summary needs\nrefinement to guarantee safety and permissiveness. We have implemented the\nalgorithms in TICC tool and compared this algorithm with some related interface\ngeneration algorithms. We also discuss the application of interface as an\noffline test-suite. We create an interface from the model program\n(specification) and the interface will act as a test-suite for the new\nimplementation-under-test (IUT)."

Similar to deterministically\ntimed process calculi, we show that these two options are not irreconcilable by\nexhibiting three mappings from an integrated-time Markovian process calculus to\nan orthogonal-time Markovian process calculus that preserve the behavioral\nequivalence of process terms under different interpretations of action\nexecution: eagerness, laziness, and maximal progress.

    "summary": "We introduce a generic extension of the popular branching-time logic CTL\nwhich refines the temporal until and release operators with formal languages.\nFor instance, a language may determine the moments along a path that an until\nproperty may be fulfilled. We consider several classes of languages leading to\nlogics with different expressive power and complexity, whose importance is\nmotivated by their use in model checking, synthesis, abstract interpretation,\netc.\n  We show that even with context-free languages on the until operator the logic\nstill allows for polynomial time model-checking despite the significant\nincrease in expressive power. This makes the logic a promising candidate for\napplications in verification.\n  In addition, we analyse the complexity of satisfiability and compare the\nexpressive power of these logics to CTL* and extensions of PDL."

    "summary": "We consider an extension of bi-intuitionistic logic with the traditional\nmodalities from tense logic Kt. Proof theoretically, this extension is obtained\nsimply by extending an existing sequent calculus for bi-intuitionistic logic\nwith typical inference rules for the modalities used in display logics. As it\nturns out, the resulting calculus, LBiKt, seems to be more basic than most\nintuitionistic tense or modal logics considered in the literature, in\nparticular, those studied by Ewald and Simpson, as it does not assume any a\npriori relationship between the diamond and the box modal operators. We recover\nEwald's intuitionistic tense logic and Simpson's intuitionistic modal logic by\nmodularly extending LBiKt with additional structural rules. The calculus LBiKt\nis formulated in a variant of display calculus, using a form of sequents called\nnested sequents. Cut elimination is proved for LBiKt, using a technique similar\nto that used in display calculi. As in display calculi, the inference rules of\nLBiKt are ``shallow'' rules, in the sense that they act on top-level formulae\nin a nested sequent. The calculus LBiKt is ill-suited for backward proof search\ndue to the presence of certain structural rules called ``display postulates''\nand the contraction rules on arbitrary structures. We show that these\nstructural rules can be made redundant in another calculus, DBiKt, which uses\ndeep inference, allowing one to apply inference rules at an arbitrary depth in\na nested sequent. We prove the equivalence between LBiKt and DBiKt and outline\na proof search strategy for DBiKt. We also give a Kripke semantics and prove\nthat LBiKt is sound with respect to the semantics, but completeness is still an\nopen problem. We then discuss various extensions of LBiKt."

    "summary": "The characterisation of termination using well-founded monotone algebras has\nbeen a milestone on the way to automated termination techniques, of which we\nhave seen an extensive development over the past years. Both the semantic\ncharacterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global\ntermination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In\nthis paper we consider local termination, of specific sets of terms within a\ngiven TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic\ncharacterisation of global termination to local termination. This is made\npossible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also\nextend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in local\ntermination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably\ninterested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of\ninputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of\ninterest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known\nto be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding\nrecursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the\nwell-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal\nof rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We\nalso describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.\nThe resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases\nalready been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation\nof the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language\nhad already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of\nS-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and\nverified proof."

Different process models that cannot be related by\nbehavioral equivalences should be compared via a quantitative notion of\nsimilarity, which is usually achieved through approximation of some\nequivalence.

As a step towards flexibility and usability, we study\ndifferent relaxations taking into account orthogonal aspects of the process\nobservations: execution time, event probability, and observed behavior. In this\nunifying framework, both interpretation of the measures and decidability of the\nverification algorithms are discussed."

    "summary": "Model-based safety analysis approaches aim at finding critical failure\ncombinations by analysis of models of the whole system (i.e. software,\nhardware, failure modes and environment). The advantage of these methods\ncompared to traditional approaches is that the analysis of the whole system\ngives more precise results. Only few model-based approaches have been applied\nto answer quantitative questions in safety analysis, often limited to analysis\nof specific failure propagation models, limited types of failure modes or\nwithout system dynamics and behavior, as direct quantitative analysis is uses\nlarge amounts of computing resources. New achievements in the domain of\n(probabilistic) model-checking now allow for overcoming this problem.\n  This paper shows how functional models based on synchronous parallel\nsemantics, which can be used for system design, implementation and qualitative\nsafety analysis, can be directly re-used for (model-based) quantitative safety\nanalysis. Accurate modeling of different types of probabilistic failure\noccurrence is shown as well as accurate interpretation of the results of the\nanalysis.

The general problem is known to be decidable by\nalgorithms exclusively based on the classical\nKosaraju-Lambert-Mayr-Sacerdote-Tenney decomposition. This decomposition is\nused in this paper to prove that the Parikh images of languages recognized by\nVASs are semi-pseudo-linear; a class that extends the semi-linear sets, a.k.a.\nthe sets definable in Presburger arithmetic. We provide an application of this\nresult; we prove that a final configuration is not reachable from an initial\none if and only if there exists a semi-linear inductive invariant that contains\nthe initial configuration but not the final one. Since we can decide if a\nPresburger formula denotes an inductive invariant, we deduce that there exist\ncheckable certificates of non-reachability. In particular, there exists a\nsimple algorithm for deciding the general VAS reachability problem based on two\nsemi-algorithms. A first one that tries to prove the reachability by\nenumerating finite sequences of actions and a second one that tries to prove\nthe non-reachability by enumerating Presburger formulas."

We prove the correctness of our model checking\nalgorithms, which terminate under reasonable non-Zeno-ness assumptions when the\nreachable state space is finite.

    "summary": "The safety of infinite state systems can be checked by a backward\nreachability procedure. For certain classes of systems, it is possible to prove\nthe termination of the procedure and hence conclude the decidability of the\nsafety problem. Although backward reachability is property-directed, it can\nunnecessarily explore (large) portions of the state space of a system which are\nnot required to verify the safety property under consideration. To avoid this,\ninvariants can be used to dramatically prune the search space. Indeed, the\nproblem is to guess such appropriate invariants. In this paper, we present a\nfully declarative and symbolic approach to the mechanization of backward\nreachability of infinite state systems manipulating arrays by Satisfiability\nModulo Theories solving. Theories are used to specify the topology and the data\nmanipulated by the system. We identify sufficient conditions on the theories to\nensure the termination of backward reachability and we show the completeness of\na method for invariant synthesis (obtained as the dual of backward\nreachability), again, under suitable hypotheses on the theories. We also\npresent a pragmatic approach to interleave invariant synthesis and backward\nreachability so that a fix-point for the set of backward reachable states is\nmore easily obtained. Finally, we discuss heuristics that allow us to derive an\nimplementation of the techniques in the model checker MCMT, showing remarkable\nspeed-ups on a significant set of safety problems extracted from a variety of\nsources."

One of the reasons for this discord is due to the\nasynchronous interaction between a plant and its controller in implementations,\nwhereas the existing supervisory control theories assume synchronous\ninteraction. As a consequence the implementation suffer from the so-called\ninexact synchronisation problem. In this paper we address the issue of inexact\nsynchronisation in a process algebraic setting, by solving a more general\nproblem of refinement.

A recent trend to address this\ndifficulty is to reduce the need for verification by adopting correct-by-design\nmethodologies. According to the correct-by-design paradigm, one seeks to\nautomatically synthesize a controller that can be refined into code and that\nenforces temporal specifications on the cyber-physical system. In this paper we\nconsider an instance of this problem where the specifications are given by a\nfragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and the physical environment is\ndescribed by a smooth differential equation. The contribution of this paper is\nto show that synthesis for cyber-physical systems is viable by considering a\nfragment of LTL that is expressive enough to describe interesting properties\nbut simple enough to avoid Safra's construction.

The verification of a safety property is reduced to a pure logical\nproblem of finding a countermodel for a first-order formula.

In\nthis paper we first establish the relative completeness of the finite\ncountermodel finding method (FCM) for a class of parameterized linear arrays of\nfinite automata.

To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we\nrestrict each player to play strategies that ensure that the player cannot be\nresponsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction of\nthese games to \\emph{turn-based} (i.e., not concurrent) \\emph{finite-state}\n(i.e., untimed) parity games. Our reduction improves the best known complexity\nfor solving timed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for\nclassical parity games can now be applied to timed parity games. The states of\nthe resulting game are based on clock regions of the original game, and the\nstate space of the finite game is linear in the size of the region graph.\n  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that\nrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,\n\\emph{limit-robust} and \\emph{bounded-robust} winning strategies. Using a\nlimit-robust winning strategy, the controller cannot choose an exact\nreal-valued time delay but must allow for some nonzero jitter in each of its\nactions. If there is a given lower bound on the jitter, then the strategy is\nbounded-robust winning. We show that exact strategies are more powerful than\nlimit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than bounded-robust winning\nstrategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies, we present\nefficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These reductions\nprovide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time controllers."

Since these mu-calculi and logic games generalise well-known\nfixpoint logics and game-theoretic decision procedures for concurrent systems\nwith interleaving semantics, the results herein give some of the groundwork for\nthe design of a logic-based, game-theoretic framework for studying, in a\nuniform way, several concurrent systems regardless of whether they have an\ninterleaving or a partial order semantics."

Our purpose is to look for a connection between these\ntwo disciplines. Following a previous work [3], we consider an extension of the\noriginal ludics with contraction and universal nondeterminism, which play dual\nroles, in order to capture a polarized fragment of linear logic and thus a\nconstructive variant of classical propositional logic. We then prove a\ncompleteness theorem for proofs in this extended setting: for any behaviour\n(formula) A and any design (proof attempt) P, either P is a proof of A or there\nis a model M of the orthogonal of A which defeats P.

Magic Sets are one of these\ntechniques, originally defined for Datalog queries (ASP without disjunction and\nnegation). Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which\nhas been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs\nwith stratified negation.\n  A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited\nalso during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines. In particular, after\nsome assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program\nmay become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for\ndynamic pruning of the search space, which may result in exponential\nperformance gains.\n  In this paper, the correctness of DMS is formally established and proved for\nbrave and cautious reasoning over the class of super-consistent ASP programs\n(ASP^{sc} programs). ASP^{sc} programs guarantee consistency (i.e., have answer\nsets) when an arbitrary set of facts is added to them. This result generalizes\nthe applicability of DMS, since the class of ASP^{sc} programs is richer than\nASP programs with stratified negation, and in particular includes all\nodd-cycle-free programs.

The proof of this result argues with their different\nexpressive power concerning leader election in symmetric networks. Later on,\nGorla offered an arguably simpler proof that, instead of leader election in\nsymmetric networks, employed the reducibility of incestual processes (mixed\nchoices that include both enabled senders and receivers for the same channel)\nwhen running two copies in parallel. In both proofs, the role of breaking\n(initial) symmetries is more or less apparent. In this paper, we shed more\nlight on this role by re-proving the above result - based on a proper\nformalization of what it means to break symmetries without referring to another\nlayer of the distinguishing problem domain of leader election. Both Palamidessi\nand Gorla rephrased their results by stating that there is no uniform and\nreasonable encoding from \\pimix into \\pisep.

    "summary": "Process behaviour is often defined either in terms of the tests they satisfy,\nor in terms of the logical properties they enjoy. Here we compare these two\napproaches, using extensional testing in the style of DeNicola, Hennessy, and a\nrecursive version of the property logic HML. We first characterise subsets of\nthis property logic which can be captured by tests. Then we show that those\nsubsets of the property logic capture precisely the power of tests."

    "summary": "It is important to enable reasoning about the meaning and possible effects of\nupdates to ensure that the updated system operates correctly. A formal,\nmathematical model of dynamic update should be developed, in order to\nunderstand by both users and implementors of update technology what design\nchoices can be considered. In this paper, we define a formal calculus\n$update\\pi$, a variant extension of higher-order $\\pi$ calculus, to model\ndynamic updates of component-based software, which is language and technology\nindependent. The calculus focuses on following main concepts: proper\ngranularity of update, timing of dynamic update, state transformation between\nversions, update failure check and recovery. We describe a series of rule on\nsafe component updates to model some general processes of dynamic update and\ndiscuss its reduction semantics coincides with a labelled transition system\nsemantics that illustrate the expressive power of these calculi."

The specific character of these logics is in matching\nvagueness or fuzziness of similarity measures to the uncertainty of models.\nThese logics are based on the following fundamental notions: generality\nrelation, uncertainty relation, simplicity relation, similarity maximization\nproblem with empirical content and enhancement (learning) operator. We develop\nthese notions in terms of logic and probability and developed a Probabilistic\nDynamic Logic of Phenomena and Cognition (P-DL-PC) that relates to the scope of\nprobabilistic models of brain. In our research the effectiveness of suggested\nformalization is demonstrated by approximation of the expert model of breast\ncancer diagnostic decisions. The P-DL-PC logic was previously successfully\napplied to solving many practical tasks and also for modelling of some\ncognitive processes."

An important issue in this context are\ncombination mechanisms for such algebraic effects, which allow for the modular\ndesign of programming languages and verification logics. The most basic\ncombination operators are sum and tensor: while the sum of effects is just\ntheir non-interacting union, the tensor imposes commutation of effects.\nHowever, for effects with unbounded arity, such as continuations or unbounded\nnondeterminism, it is not a priori clear whether these combinations actually\nexist in all cases. Here, we introduce the class of uniform effects, which\nincludes unbounded nondeterminism and continuations, and prove that the tensor\ndoes always exist if one of the component effects is uniform, thus in\nparticular improving on previous results on tensoring with continuations. We\nthen treat the case of nondeterminism in more detail, and give an\norder-theoretic characterization of effects for which tensoring with\nnondeterminism is conservative, thus enabling nondeterministic arguments such\nas a generic version of the Fischer-Ladner encoding of control operators."

    "summary": "In sequential logic there is an order in which the atomic propositions in an\nexpression are evaluated. This order allows the same atomic proposition to have\ndifferent values depending on which atomic propositions have already been\nevaluated. In the sequential propositional logic discussed in this thesis, such\nvaluations are called \"reactive\" valuations, in contrast to \"static\" valuations\nas are common in e.g. ordinary propositional logic. There are many classes of\nthese reactive valuations e.g., we can define a class of reactive valuations\nsuch that the value for each atomic proposition remains the same until another\natomic proposition is evaluated. This Master of Logic thesis consists of a\nstudy of some of the properties of this logic. We take a closer look at some of\nthe classes of reactive valuations. We particularly focus on the relation\nbetween the axiomatization and the semantics. Consequently, the main part of\nthis thesis focuses on proving soundness and completeness. Furthermore, we show\nthat the axioms in the provided axiomatizations are independent i.e., there are\nno redundant axioms present. Finally, we show {\\omega}-completeness for two\nclasses of reactive valuations."

Psi-calculi can capture the same phenomena as other\nproposed extensions of the pi-calculus such as the applied pi-calculus, the\nspi-calculus, the fusion calculus, the concurrent constraint pi-calculus, and\ncalculi with polyadic communication channels or pattern matching. Psi-calculi\ncan be even more general, for example by allowing structured channels,\nhigher-order formalisms such as the lambda calculus for data structures, and\npredicate logic for assertions. We provide ample comparisons to related calculi\nand discuss a few significant applications. Our labelled operational semantics\nand definition of bisimulation is straightforward, without a structural\ncongruence. We establish minimal requirements on the nominal data and logic in\norder to prove general algebraic properties of psi-calculi, all of which have\nbeen checked in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle.

The central\nquestion that we address is: what is the probability of the set of paths of C\nthat are accepted by A, i.e., the likelihood that C satisfies A? It is shown\nthat under finite acceptance criteria this equals the reachability probability\nin a finite piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDP), whereas for Muller\nacceptance criteria it coincides with the reachability probability of terminal\nstrongly connected components in such a PDP. Qualitative verification is shown\nto amount to a graph analysis of the PDP. Reachability probabilities in our\nPDPs are then characterized as the least solution of a system of Volterra\nintegral equations of the second type and are shown to be approximated by the\nsolution of a system of partial differential equations. For single-clock DTA,\nthis integral equation system can be transformed into a system of linear\nequations where the coefficients are solutions of ordinary differential\nequations. As the coefficients are in fact transient probabilities in CTMCs,\nthis result implies that standard algorithms for CTMC analysis suffice to\nverify single-clock DTA specifications."

In particular, any realizer of an\nimplication-and-negation-free arithmetical formula embodies a winning recursive\nstrategy for the 1-Backtracking version of Tarski games. We also give examples\nof realizer and winning strategy extraction for some classical proofs. We also\nsketch some ongoing work about how to extend our notion of realizability in\norder to obtain completeness with respect to Coquand semantics, when it is\nrestricted to 1-Backtracking games."

    "summary": "Several proof translations of classical mathematics into intuitionistic\nmathematics have been proposed in the literature over the past century. These\nare normally referred to as negative translations or double-negation\ntranslations. Among those, the most commonly cited are translations due to\nKolmogorov, Godel, Gentzen, Kuroda and Krivine (in chronological order). In\nthis paper we propose a framework for explaining how these different\ntranslations are related to each other. More precisely, we define a notion of a\n(modular) simplification starting from Kolmogorov translation, which leads to a\npartial order between different negative translations. In this derived\nordering, Kuroda and Krivine are minimal elements. Two new minimal translations\nare introduced, with Godel and Gentzen translations sitting in between\nKolmogorov and one of these new translations."

In the original interpretation decidability of atoms is\nrequired to compute the correct counterexample from a set of candidates. When\ncombined with recursion, this choice needs to be made for every step in the\nextracted program, however, in some special cases the decision on negative\nwitnesses can be calculated only once. We present a variant of the\ninterpretation in which the time complexity of extracted programs can be\nimproved by marking the chosen witness and thus avoiding recomputation.

We stress that this fact can be interpreted in two ways.\nAccording to the \"sequential interpretation\", a term graph reduction\ncorresponds to an infinite sequence of term reductions, as formalized by\nKennaway et.al. using strongly converging derivations over the complete metric\nspace of infinite terms. Instead according to the \"parallel interpretation\" a\nterm graph reduction corresponds to the parallel reduction of an infinite set\nof redexes in a rational term.

    "summary": "We propose a new definition of the representation theorem for many-valued\nlogics, with modal operators as well, and define the stronger relationship\nbetween algebraic models of a given logic and relational structures used to\ndefine the Kripke possible-world semantics for it. Such a new framework offers\na new semantics for many-valued logics based on the truth-invariance\nentailment. Consequently, it is substantially different from current\ndefinitions based on a matrix with a designated subset of logic values, used\nfor the satisfaction relation, often difficult to fix. In the case when the\nmany-valued modal logics are based on the set of truth-values that are complete\ndistributive lattices we obtain a compact autoreferential Kripke-style\ncanonical representation. The Kripke-style semantics for this subclass of modal\nlogics have the joint-irreducible subset of the carrier set of many-valued\nalgebras as set of possible worlds. A significant member of this subclass is\nthe paraconsistent fuzzy logic extended by new logic values in order to also\ndeal with incomplete and inconsistent information. This new theory is applied\nfor the case of autoepistemic intuitionistic many-valued logic, based on\nBelnap's 4-valued bilattice, as a minimal extension of classical logic used to\nmanage incomplete and inconsistent information as well."

    "summary": "The operational semantics of interactive systems is usually described by\nlabeled transition systems. Abstract semantics (that is defined in terms of\nbisimilarity) is characterized by the final morphism in some category of\ncoalgebras. Since the behaviour of interactive systems is for many reasons\ninfinite, symbolic semantics were introduced as a mean to define smaller,\npossibly finite, transition systems, by employing symbolic actions and avoiding\nsome sources of infiniteness. Unfortunately, symbolic bisimilarity has a\ndifferent shape with respect to ordinary bisimilarity, and thus the standard\ncoalgebraic characterization does not work. In this paper, we introduce its\ncoalgebraic models. We will use as motivating examples two asynchronous\nformalisms: open Petri nets and asynchronous pi-calculus. Indeed, as we have\nshown in a previous paper, asynchronous bisimilarity can be seen as an instance\nof symbolic bisimilarity."

Thus, it is important to have a\nlogic, both for computation of probabilities and for reasoning about\nprobabilities, with a well-defined syntax and semantics. Both current\napproaches, based on Nilsson's probability structures/logics, and on linear\ninequalities in order to reason about probabilities, have some weak points. In\nthis paper we have presented the complete revision of both approaches. We have\nshown that the full embedding of Nilsson'probabilistic structure into\npropositional logic results in a truth-functional many-valued logic,\ndifferently from Nilsson's intuition and current considerations about\npropositional probabilistic logic. Than we have shown that the logic for\nreasoning about probabilities can be naturally embedded into a 2-valued\nintensional FOL with intensional abstraction, by avoiding current ad-hoc system\ncomposed of two different 2-valued logics: one for the classical propositional\nlogic at lower-level, and a new one at higher-level for probabilistic\nconstraints with probabilistic variables.

We show that several existing proposals for lifting\nrelations can be reconciled to be different presentations of essentially the\nsame lifting operation. More interestingly, this lifting operation nicely\ncorresponds to the Kantorovich metric, a fundamental concept used in\nmathematics to lift a metric on states to a metric on distributions of states,\nbesides the fact the lifting operation is related to the maximum flow problem\nin optimisation theory.\n  The lifting operation yields a neat notion of probabilistic bisimulation, for\nwhich we provide logical, metric, and algorithmic characterisations.\nSpecifically, we extend the Hennessy-Milner logic and the modal mu-calculus\nwith a new modality, resulting in an adequate and an expressive logic for\nprobabilistic bisimilarity, respectively. The correspondence of the lifting\noperation and the Kantorovich metric leads to a natural characterisation of\nbisimulations as pseudometrics which are post-fixed points of a monotone\nfunction. We also present an \"on the fly\" algorithm to check if two states in a\nfinitary system are related by probabilistic bisimilarity, exploiting the close\nrelationship between the lifting operation and the maximum flow problem."

The second style of calculi uses deep-inference, whereby inference rules\ncan be applied at any node in a nested sequent. We show that, for a range of\nextensions of tense logic, the two styles of calculi are equivalent, and there\nis a natural proof theoretic correspondence between display postulates and deep\ninference.

It yields a fully satisfying solution for at least all\none-safe nets. However, for certain nets which intuitively have different\nconflicting behaviours, it yields only one maximal abstract process. Here we\nidentify a class of place/transition systems, called structural conflict nets,\nwhere conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity are clearly separated.\nWe show that, in the case of structural conflict nets, the equivalence proposed\nby Best and Devillers yields a unique maximal abstract process only for\nconflict-free nets.

    "summary": "In the field of Business Process Management formal models for the control\nflow of business processes have been designed since more than 15 years. Which\nmethods are best suited to verify the bulk of these models? The first step is\nto select a formal language which fixes the semantics of the models. We adopt\nthe language of Boolean systems as reference language for Boolean process\nmodels. Boolean systems form a simple subclass of coloured Petri nets. Their\ncharacteristics are low tokens to model explicitly states with a subsequent\nskipping of activations and arbitrary logical rules of type AND, XOR, OR etc.\nto model the split and join of the control flow. We apply model checking as a\nverification method for the safeness and liveness of Boolean systems. Model\nchecking of Boolean systems uses the elementary theory of propositional logic,\nno modal operators are needed. Our verification builds on a finite complete\nprefix of a certain T-system attached to the Boolean system. It splits the\nprocesses of the Boolean system into a finite set of base processes of bounded\nlength. Their behaviour translates to formulas from propositional logic. Our\nverification task consists in checking the satisfiability of these formulas. In\naddition we have implemented our model checking algorithm as a java program.\nThe time needed to verify a given Boolean system depends critically on the\nnumber of initial tokens. Because the algorithm has to solve certain\nSAT-problems, polynomial complexity cannot be expected. The paper closes with\nthe model checking of some Boolean process models which have been designed as\nEvent-driven Process Chains."

    "summary": "Cryptographic protocols are the cornerstone of security in distributed\nsystems. The formal analysis of their properties is accordingly one of the\nfocus points of the security community, and is usually split among two groups.\nIn the first group, one focuses on trace-based security properties such as\nconfidentiality and authentication, and provides decision procedures for the\nexistence of attacks for an on-line attackers. In the second group, one focuses\non equivalence properties such as privacy and guessing attacks, and provides\ndecision procedures for the existence of attacks for an offline attacker. In\nall cases the attacker is modeled by a deduction system in which his possible\nactions are expressed. We present in this paper a notion of finitary deduction\nsystems that aims at relating both approaches. We prove that for such deduction\nsystems, deciding equivalence properties for on-line attackers can be reduced\nto deciding reachability properties in the same setting."

    "summary": "Size-Change Termination (SCT) is a method of proving program termination\nbased on the impossibility of infinite descent. To this end we use a program\nabstraction in which transitions are described by Monotonicity Constraints over\n(abstract) variables. When only constraints of the form x>y' and x\\geq y' are\nallowed, we have size-change graphs. In the last decade, both theory and\npractice have evolved significantly in this restricted framework. The crucial\nunderlying assumption of most of the past work is that the domain of the\nvariables is well-founded. In a recent paper I showed how to extend and adapt\nsome theory from the domain of size-change graphs to general monotonicity\nconstraints, thus complementing previous work, but remaining in the realm of\nwell-founded domains. However, monotonicity constraints are, interestingly,\ncapable of proving termination also in the integer domain, which is not\nwell-founded. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of\nmonotonicity constraints in this domain. We lay the necessary theoretical\nfoundation, and present precise decision procedures for termination; finally,\nwe provide a procedure to construct explicit global ranking functions from\nmonotonicity constraints in singly-exponential time, and of optimal worst-case\nsize and dimension (ordinal)."

    "summary": "PCF is a sequential simply typed lambda calculus language. There is a unique\norder-extensional fully abstract cpo model of PCF, built up from equivalence\nclasses of terms. In 1979, G\\'erard Berry defined the stable order in this\nmodel and proved that the extensional and the stable order together form a\nbicpo. He made the following two conjectures: 1) \"Extensional and stable order\nform not only a bicpo, but a bidomain.\" We refute this conjecture by showing\nthat the stable order is not bounded complete, already for finitary PCF of\nsecond-order types. 2) \"The stable order of the model has the syntactic order\nas its image: If a is less than b in the stable order of the model, for finite\na and b, then there are normal form terms A and B with the semantics a, resp.\nb, such that A is less than B in the syntactic order.\" We give counter-examples\nto this conjecture, again in finitary PCF of second-order types, and also\nrefute an improved conjecture: There seems to be no simple syntactic\ncharacterization of the stable order. But we show that Berry's conjecture is\ntrue for unary PCF. For the preliminaries, we explain the basic fully abstract\nsemantics of PCF in the general setting of (not-necessarily complete) partial\norder models (f-models.) And we restrict the syntax to \"game terms\", with a\ngraphical representation."

For this model we consider a decision problem that can be\nexpressed as the verification of the existence of an initial topology in which\nthe execution of the protocol can lead to a configuration with at least one\nnode in a certain state. The decision problem is parametric both on the size\nand on the form of the communication topology of the initial configurations.

    "summary": "Many programming languages and tools, ranging from grep to the Java String\nlibrary, contain regular expression matchers. Rather than first translating a\nregular expression into a deterministic finite automaton, such implementations\ntypically match the regular expression on the fly. Thus they can be seen as\nvirtual machines interpreting the regular expression much as if it were a\nprogram with some non-deterministic constructs such as the Kleene star. We\nformalize this implementation technique for regular expression matching using\noperational semantics. Specifically, we derive a series of abstract machines,\nmoving from the abstract definition of matching to increasingly realistic\nmachines. First a continuation is added to the operational semantics to\ndescribe what remains to be matched after the current expression. Next, we\nrepresent the expression as a data structure using pointers, which enables\nredundant searches to be eliminated via testing for pointer equality. From\nthere, we arrive both at Thompson's lockstep construction and a machine that\nperforms some operations in parallel, suitable for implementation on a large\nnumber of cores, such as a GPU. We formalize the parallel machine using process\nalgebra and report some preliminary experiments with an implementation on a\ngraphics processor using CUDA."

    "summary": "In this paper, for a given sequentially Yoneda-complete T_1 quasi-metric\nspace (X,d), the domain theoretic models of the hyperspace K_0(X) of nonempty\ncompact subsets of (X,d) are studied. To this end, the $\\omega$-Plotkin domain\nof the space of formal balls BX, denoted by CBX is considered. This domain is\ngiven as the chain completion of the set of all finite subsets of BX with\nrespect to the Egli-Milner relation. Further, a map $\\phi:K_0(X)\\rightarrow\nCBX$ is established and proved that it is an embedding whenever K_0(X) is\nequipped with the Vietoris topology and respectively CBX with the Scott\ntopology. Moreover, if any compact subset of (X,d) is d^{-1}-precompact, \\phi\nis an embedding with respect to the topology of Hausdorff quasi-metric H_d on\nK_0(X). Therefore, it is concluded that (CBX,\\sqsubseteq,\\phi) is an\n$\\omega$-computational model for the hyperspace K_0(X) endowed with the\nVietoris and respectively the Hausdorff topology. Next, an algebraic\nsequentially Yoneda-complete quasi-metric D on CBX$ is introduced in such a way\nthat the specialization order $\\sqsubseteq_D$ is equivalent to the usual\npartial order of CBX and, furthermore, $\\phi:({\\cal\nK}_0(X),H_d)\\rightarrow({\\bf C}{\\bf B}X,D)$ is an isometry. This shows that\n(CBX,\\sqsubseteq,\\phi,D) is a quantitative $\\omega$-computational model for\n(K_(X),H_d)."

The\nformalization is made within the Isabelle/HOL system and the total correctness\n(soundness, termination, completeness) is shown for each presented system (with\nrespect to a simple notion of satisfiability that can be manually checked). The\nsystems are defined in a general way and cover procedures used in a wide range\nof modern SAT solvers. Our formalization builds up on the previous work on\nstate transition systems for SAT, but it gives machine-verifiable proofs,\nsomewhat more general specifications, and weaker assumptions that ensure the\nkey correctness properties. The presented proofs of formal correctness of the\ntransition systems can be used as a key building block in proving correctness\nof SAT solvers by using other verification approaches."

    "summary": "Covariant-contravariant simulation is a combination of standard (covariant)\nsimulation, its contravariant counterpart and bisimulation. We have previously\nstudied its logical characterization by means of the covariant-contravariant\nmodal logic. Moreover, we have investigated the relationships between this\nmodel and that of modal transition systems, where two kinds of transitions (the\nso-called may and must transitions) were combined in order to obtain a simple\nframework to express a notion of refinement over state-transition models. In a\nclassic paper, Boudol and Larsen established a precise connection between the\ngraphical approach, by means of modal transition systems, and the logical\napproach, based on Hennessy-Milner logic without negation, to system\nspecification. They obtained a (graphical) representation theorem proving that\na formula can be represented by a term if, and only if, it is consistent and\nprime. We show in this paper that the formulae from the covariant-contravariant\nmodal logic that admit a \"graphical\" representation by means of processes,\nmodulo the covariant-contravariant simulation preorder, are also the consistent\nand prime ones. In order to obtain the desired graphical representation result,\nwe first restrict ourselves to the case of covariant-contravariant systems\nwithout bivariant actions. Bivariant actions can be incorporated later by means\nof an encoding that splits each bivariant action into its covariant and its\ncontravariant parts."

This\nprocedure is interesting both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.\nIn particular, a linearization algorithm is needed for the Compositional\nInterchange Format (CIF), an automaton based modeling language.\n  The problem of devising efficient linearization algorithms is not trivial,\nand has been already addressed in literature. However, the linearization\nalgorithms obtained are the result of an inventive process, and the proof of\ncorrectness comes as an afterthought. Furthermore, the semantic specification\nof the language does not play an important role on the design of the algorithm.\n  In this work we present a method for obtaining an efficient linearization\nalgorithm, through a step-wise refinement of the SOS rules of CIF. As a result,\nwe show how the semantic specification of the language can guide the\nimplementation of such a procedure, yielding a simple proof of correctness."

This semantics takes a positive\nhypotheses assumption approach as a means to guarantee the desirable properties\nof model existence, relevance and cumulativity, and of generalizing the Stable\nModels in the process. To do so we first introduce the fundamental semantic\nconcept of minimality of assumed positive hypotheses, define the MH semantics,\nand analyze the semantics' properties and applicability. Indeed, abductive\nLogic Programming can be conceptually captured by a strategy centered on the\nassumption of abducibles (or hypotheses). Likewise, the Argumentation\nperspective of Logic Programs also lends itself to an arguments (or hypotheses)\nassumption approach. Previous works on Abduction have depicted the atoms of\ndefault negated literals in NLPs as abducibles, i.e., assumable hypotheses. We\ntake a complementary and more general view than these works to NLP semantics by\nemploying positive hypotheses instead."

Our proof is intuitionistic and\nprovides an effective procedure Prf that converts uniform minimal evidence into\na formal first-order proof. We have implemented Prf. Uniform validity is\ndefined using the intersection operator as a universal quantifier over the\ndomain of discourse and atomic predicates. Formulas of iFOL that are uniformly\nvalid are also intuitionistically valid, but not conversely. Our strongest\nresult requires the Fan Theorem; it can also be proved classically by showing\nthat Prf terminates using Konig's Theorem.\n  The fundamental idea behind our completeness theorem is that a single\nevidence term evd witnesses the uniform validity of a minimal logic formula F.\nFinding even one uniform realizer guarantees intuitionistic validity because\nPrf(F, evd) builds a first-order proof of F, establishing its intuitionistic\nvalidity and providing a purely logical normalized realizer.\n  We establish completeness for iFOL as follows. Friedman showed that iFOL can\nbe embedded in minimal logic (mFOL) by his A-transformation, mapping formula F\nto FA. If F is uniformly valid, then so is FA, and by our completeness theorem,\nwe can find a proof of FA in minimal logic.

    "summary": "We investigate quantitative properties of BCI and BCK logics. The first part\nof the paper compares the number of formulas provable in BCI versus BCK logics.\nWe consider formulas built on implication and a fixed set of $k$ variables. We\ninvestigate the proportion between the number of such formulas of a given\nlength $n$ provable in BCI logic against the number of formulas of length $n$\nprovable in richer BCK logic. We examine an asymptotic behavior of this\nfraction when length $n$ of formulas tends to infinity. This limit gives a\nprobability measure that randomly chosen BCK formula is also provable in BCI.\nWe prove that this probability tends to zero as the number of variables tends\nto infinity. The second part of the paper is devoted to the number of lambda\nterms representing proofs of BCI and BCK logics. We build a proportion between\nnumber of such proofs of the same length $n$ and we investigate asymptotic\nbehavior of this proportion when length of proofs tends to infinity. We\ndemonstrate that with probability 0 a randomly chosen BCK proof is also a proof\nof a BCI formula."

    "summary": "The Parameterised Model Checking Problem asks whether an implementation\nImpl(t) satisfies a specification Spec(t) for all instantiations of parameter\nt. In general, t can determine numerous entities: the number of processes used\nin a network, the type of data, the capacities of buffers, etc. The main theme\nof this paper is automation of uniform verification of a subclass of PMCP with\nthe parameter of the first kind, i.e. the number of processes in the network.\nWe use CSP as our formalism. We present a type reduction theory, which, for a\ngiven verification problem, establishes a function \\phi that maps all\n(sufficiently large) instantiations T of the parameter to some fixed type T^\nand allows us to deduce that if Spec(T^) is refined by \\phi(Impl(T)), then\n(subject to certain assumptions) Spec(T) is refined by Impl(T). The theory can\nbe used in practice by combining it with a suitable abstraction method that\nproduces a t-independent process Abstr that is refined by {\\phi}(Impl(T)) for\nall sufficiently large T. Then, by testing (with a model checker) if the\nabstract model Abstr refines Spec(T^), we can deduce a positive answer to the\noriginal uniform verification problem. The type reduction theory relies on\nsymbolic representation of process behaviour. We develop a symbolic operational\nsemantics for CSP processes that satisfy certain normality requirements, and we\nprovide a set of translation rules that allow us to concretise symbolic\ntransition graphs. Based on this, we prove results that allow us to infer\nbehaviours of a process instantiated with uncollapsed types from known\nbehaviours of the same process instantiated with a reduced type. One of the\nmain advantages of our symbolic operational semantics and the type reduction\ntheory is their generality, which makes them applicable in a wide range of\nsettings."

We base our\nnotions of simulations on the similar concepts used in previous work for\nprobabilistic CSP. However, unlike the case with CSP (or other\nnon-value-passing calculi), there are several possible definitions of\nsimulation for the probabilistic pi-calculus, which arise from different ways\nof scoping the name quantification.

As in an earlier work on testing equivalence for the pi-calculus\nby Boreale and De Nicola, we extend the language of the $\\pi$-calculus with a\nmismatch operator, without which the formulation of a characteristic test will\nnot be possible."

    "summary": "We consider infinite sequences of symbols, also known as streams, and the\ndecidability question for equality of streams defined in a restricted format.\nThis restricted format consists of prefixing a symbol at the head of a stream,\nof the stream function `zip', and recursion variables. Here `zip' interleaves\nthe elements of two streams in alternating order, starting with the first\nstream. For example, the Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by the\n`zip-specification' {M = 0 : X, X = 1 : zip(X,Y), Y = 0 : zip(Y,X)}. Our\nanalysis of such systems employs both term rewriting and coalgebraic\ntechniques. We establish decidability for these zip-specifications, employing\nbisimilarity of observation graphs based on a suitably chosen cobasis. The\nimportance of zip-specifications resides in their intimate connection with\nautomatic sequences. We establish a new and simple characterization of\nautomatic sequences. Thus we obtain for the binary zip that a stream is\n2-automatic iff its observation graph using the cobasis (hd,even,odd) is\nfinite. The generalization to zip-k specifications and their relation to\nk-automaticity is straightforward. In fact, zip-specifications can be perceived\nas a term rewriting syntax for automatic sequences. Our study of\nzip-specifications is placed in an even wider perspective by employing the\nobservation graphs in a dynamic logic setting, leading to an alternative\ncharacterization of automatic sequences. We further obtain a natural extension\nof the class of automatic sequences, obtained by `zip-mix' specifications that\nuse zips of different arities in one specification. We also show that\nequivalence is undecidable for a simple extension of the zip-mix format with\nprojections like even and odd. However, it remains open whether zip-mix\nspecifications have a decidable equivalence problem."

Our approach is generic and can be\nimplemented on top of any procedural interactive theorem prover, regardless of\nits architecture and logical foundations. To show the viability of our proposed\napproach, we fully implemented it as a proof interface called miz3, on top of\nthe HOL Light interactive theorem prover. The declarative language that this\ninterface uses is a slight variant of the language of the Mizar system, and can\nbe used for any interactive theorem prover regardless of its logical\nfoundations. The miz3 interface allows easy access to the full set of tactics\nand formal libraries of HOL Light, and as such has \"industrial strength\". Our\napproach gives a way to automatically convert any procedural proof to a\ndeclarative counterpart, where the converted proof is similar in size to the\noriginal. As all declarative systems have essentially the same proof language,\nthis gives a straightforward way to port proofs between interactive theorem\nprovers."

Alternating transition systems (ATSs) provide a\ngeneral model for composite reactive systems, and the simulation relation for\nATSs is known as alternating simulation. The simulation relation for fair\ntransition systems is called fair simulation. In this work our main\ncontributions are as follows: (1) We present an improved algorithm for fair\nsimulation with B\\\"uchi fairness constraints; our algorithm requires $O(n^3\n\\cdot m)$ time as compared to the previous known $O(n^6)$-time algorithm, where\n$n$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of transitions.

The question naturally arises whether a given tree\nautomatic structure is already word automatic. We prove that this problem is\ndecidable for tree automatic scattered linear orderings. Moreover, we show that\nin case of a positive answer a word automatic presentation is computable from\nthe tree automatic presentation."

Moreover,\nwe show that on classes of formulae of bounded fotw, model checking is fixed\nparameter tractable, with parameter the length of the formula. This is done by\ntranslating a formula \\phi\\ with fotw(\\phi)<k into a formula of the k-variable\nfragment L^k of first order logic. For fixed k, the question whether a given\nfirst order formula is equivalent to an L^k formula is undecidable. In\ncontrast, the classes of first order formulae with bounded fotw are fragments\nof first order logic for which the equivalence is decidable.\n  Our notion of tree-width generalises tree-width of conjunctive queries to\narbitrary formulae of first order logic by taking into account the quantifier\ninteraction in a formula. Moreover, it is more powerful than the notion of\nelimination-width of quantified constraint formulae, defined by Chen and Dalmau\n(CSL 2005): for quantified constraint formulae, both bounded elimination-width\nand bounded fotw allow for model checking in polynomial time. We prove that\nfotw of a quantified constraint formula \\phi\\ is bounded by the\nelimination-width of \\phi, and we exhibit a class of quantified constraint\nformulae with bounded fotw, that has unbounded elimination-width. A similar\ncomparison holds for strict tree-width of non-recursive stratified datalog as\ndefined by Flum, Frick, and Grohe (JACM 49, 2002).\n  Finally, we show that fotw has a characterization in terms of a cops and\nrobbers game without monotonicity cost."

    "summary": "In the last years, the adoption of active systems has increased in many\nfields of computer science, such as databases, sensor networks, and software\nengineering. These systems are able to automatically react to events, by\ncollecting information from outside and internally generating new events.\nHowever, the collection of data is often hampered by uncertainty and vagueness\nthat can arise from the imprecision of the monitoring infrastructure,\nunreliable data sources, and networks. The decision making mechanism used to\nproduce a reaction is also imprecise, and cannot be evaluated in a crisp way.\nIt depends on the evaluation of vague temporal constraints, which are expressed\non the collected data by humans. Despite fuzzy logic has been mainly conceived\nas a mathematical abstraction to express vagueness, no attempt has been made to\nfuzzify the temporal modalities. Existing fuzzy languages do not allow us to\nrepresent temporal properties, such as \"almost always\" and \"soon\". Indeed, the\nsemantics of existing fuzzy temporal operators is based on the idea of\nreplacing classical connectives or propositions with their fuzzy counterparts.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a temporal framework, FTL (Fuzzy-time\nTemporal Logic), to express vagueness on time. This framework formally defines\na set of fuzzy temporal modalities, which can be customized by choosing a\nspecific semantics for the connectives. The semantics of the language is sound,\nand the introduced modalities respect a set of expected mutual relations. We\nalso prove that under the assumption that all events are crisp, FTL reduces to\nLTL. Finally, for some of the possible fuzzy interpretations of the\nconnectives, we identify adequate sets of temporal operators, from which it is\npossible to derive all the others."

Unlike locks and critical sections, Pthreads barriers enable\nsimultaneous resource redistribution between multiple threads and are\ninherently stateful, leading to significant complications in the design of the\nlogic and its soundness proof. We show how our logic can be applied to a\nspecific example program in a modular way. Our proofs are machine-checked in\nCoq. We showcase a program verification toolset that automatically applies the\nlogic rules and discharges the associated proof obligations."

    "summary": "The powerset construction is a standard method for converting a\nnondeterministic automaton into a deterministic one recognizing the same\nlanguage. In this paper, we lift the powerset construction from automata to the\nmore general framework of coalgebras with structured state spaces. Coalgebra is\nan abstract framework for the uniform study of different kinds of dynamical\nsystems. An endofunctor F determines both the type of systems (F-coalgebras)\nand a notion of behavioural equivalence (~_F) amongst them. Many types of\ntransition systems and their equivalences can be captured by a functor F. For\nexample, for deterministic automata the derived equivalence is language\nequivalence, while for non-deterministic automata it is ordinary bisimilarity.\nWe give several examples of applications of our generalized determinization\nconstruction, including partial Mealy machines, (structured) Moore automata,\nRabin probabilistic automata, and, somewhat surprisingly, even pushdown\nautomata. To further witness the generality of the approach we show how to\ncharacterize coalgebraically several equivalences which have been object of\ninterest in the concurrency community, such as failure or ready semantics."

This logic includes a form of hypothetical\njudgment that leads to dynamically changing sets of assumptions and that is key\nto encoding side conditions and contexts that occur frequently in structural\noperational semantics (SOS) style presentations. Specifications are often\nuseful in reasoning about the systems they describe. The Abella theorem prover\nsupports such reasoning by explicitly embedding the specification logic within\na rich reasoning logic; specifications are then reasoned about through this\nembedding. However, realizing an induction principle in the face of dynamically\nchanging assumption sets is nontrivial and the original Abella system uses only\na subset of the HH specification logic for this reason. We develop a method\nhere for supporting inductive reasoning over all of HH. Our approach takes\nadvantage of a focusing property of HH to isolate the use of an assumption and\nthe ability to finitely characterize the structure of any such assumption in\nthe reasoning logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these ideas via\nseveral specification and meta-theoretic reasoning examples that have been\nimplemented in an extended version of Abella."

    "summary": "Iterative imperative programs can be considered as infinite-state systems\ncomputing over possibly unbounded domains. Studying reachability in these\nsystems is challenging as it requires to deal with an infinite number of states\nwith standard backward or forward exploration strategies. An approach that we\ncall Constraint-based reachability, is proposed to address reachability\nproblems by exploring program states using a constraint model of the whole\nprogram. The keypoint of the approach is to interpret imperative constructions\nsuch as conditionals, loops, array and memory manipulations with the\nfundamental notion of constraint over a computational domain. By combining\nconstraint filtering and abstraction techniques, Constraint-based reachability\nis able to solve reachability problems which are usually outside the scope of\nbackward or forward exploration strategies. This paper proposes an\ninterpretation of classical filtering consistencies used in Constraint\nProgramming as abstract domain computations, and shows how this approach can be\nused to produce a constraint solver that efficiently generates solutions for\nreachability problems that are unsolvable by other approaches."

However, in this approach, the\nprocedure to detect symmetries does not allow for computationally efficient\nalgorithms, mainly because each newly computed state has to be compared with\nevery already reached state.\n  In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect symmetries in this\nframework that will solve this problem, thus enabling for efficient algorithms.\nWe formalise a canonical representation of states and identify a sufficient\ncondition on the analysed model that guarantees that every symmetry can be\ndetected.

Indeed,\nthere are well-known ESO characterizations of NP-complete problems such as\n3-colorability, Hamiltonicity and clique. Furthermore, the ESO sentences that\ncharacterize those problems are simple and elegant. However, there are also NP\nproblems that do not seem to possess equally simple and elegant ESO\ncharacterizations. In this work, we are mainly interested in this latter class\nof problems.

We also provide detailed\ndescriptions of the strategies followed to obtain the corresponding nontrivial\nsecond-order sentences.

Traditional tactic languages, often based on stack-based\ngoal propagation, make it easy to write proofs that obscure the flow of goals\nbetween tactics and are fragile to minor changes in input, proof structure or\nchanges to tactics themselves. Here, we address this by introducing a graphical\nlanguage called PSGraph for writing proof strategies. Strategies are\nconstructed visually by \"wiring together\" collections of tactics and evaluated\nby propagating goal nodes through the diagram via graph rewriting. Tactic nodes\ncan have many output wires, and use a filtering procedure based on goal-types\n(predicates describing the features of a goal) to decide where best to send\nnewly-generated sub-goals.\n  In addition to making the flow of goal information explicit, the graphical\nlanguage can fulfil the role of many tacticals using visual idioms like\nbranching, merging, and feedback loops. We argue that this language enables\ndevelopment of more robust proof strategies and provide several examples, along\nwith a prototype implementation in Isabelle."

The\ngain in expressive power rises the notion of \"sustainable capacities\" for\nagents.\n  USL is built from SL. It mainly brings to SL the two following modifications:\nsemantically, the successor of a given state is not uniquely determined by the\ndata of one choice from each agent. Syntactically, we introduce in the language\nan operator, called an \"unbinder\", which explicitely deletes the binding of a\nstrategy to an agent.

    "summary": "This paper is an expository contribution reporting on published work. It\nfocusses on an approach followed in the rewriting community to formalize the\nconcept of strategy. Based on rewriting concepts, several definitions of\nstrategy are reviewed and connected: in order to catch the higher-order nature\nof strategies, a strategy is defined as a proof term expressed in the rewriting\nlogic or in the rewriting calculus; to address in a coherent way deduction and\ncomputation, a strategy is seen as a subset of derivations; and to recover the\ndefinition of strategy in sequential path-building games or in functional\nprograms, a strategy is considered as a partial function that associates to a\nreduction-in-progress, the possible next steps in the reduction sequence."

    "summary": "Existing approaches to the synthesis of reactive systems typically involve\nthe construction of transition systems such as Mealy automata. However, in\norder to obtain a succinct representation of the desired system, structured\nprograms can be a more suitable model. In 2011, Madhusudan proposed an\nalgorithm to construct a structured reactive program for a given omega-regular\nspecification without synthesizing a transition system first. His procedure is\nbased on two-way alternating omega-automata on finite trees that recognize the\nset of \"correct\" programs.\n  We present a more elementary and direct approach using only deterministic\nbottom-up tree automata that compute so-called signatures for a given program.\nIn doing so, we extend Madhusudan's results to the wider class of programs with\nbounded delay, which may read several input symbols before producing an output\nsymbol (or vice versa). As a formal foundation, we inductively define a\nsemantics for such programs."

We show that for conjunctive queries that admit nice decomposition\nproperties (such as being of bounded treewidth or generalized hypertree width)\nbounded quantified star size exactly characterizes the classes of queries for\nwhich counting the number of solutions is tractable. This also allows us to\nfully characterize the conjunctive queries for which counting the solutions is\ntractable in the case of bounded arity. To illustrate the applicability of our\nresults, we also show that computing the quantified star size of a formula is\npossible in time $n^{O(k)}$ for queries of generalized hypertree width $k$.\nFurthermore, quantified star size is even fixed parameter tractable\nparameterized by some other width measures, while it is $\\W{1}$-hard for\ngeneralized hypertree width and thus unlikely to be fixed parameter tractable.\nWe finally show how to compute an approximation of quantified star size in\npolynomial time where the approximation ratio depends on the width of the\ninput."

Then there is another circuit $Z^*$ computing\nthe same function as $Z$ having treewidth at most $18k+2$ and which has at most\n$4|Z|$ gates where $|Z|$ is the number of gates of $Z$. In this sense,\ncliquewidth is not more `powerful' than treewidth for the purpose of\nrepresentation of Boolean functions. We believe this is quite a surprising fact\nbecause it contrasts the situation with graphs where an upper bound on the\ntreewidth implies an upper bound on the cliquewidth but not vice versa.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of the new theorem for knowledge compilation.\nIn particular, we show that a circuit $Z$ of cliquewidth $k$ can be compiled\ninto a Decomposable Negation Normal Form ({\\sc dnnf}) of size\n$O(9^{18k}k^2|Z|)$ and the same runtime.

    "summary": "The cut-elimination method CERES (for first- and higher-order classical\nlogic) is based on the notion of a characteristic clause set, which is\nextracted from an LK-proof and is always unsatisfiable. A resolution refutation\nof this clause set can be used as a skeleton for a proof with atomic cuts only\n(atomic cut normal form). This is achieved by replacing clauses from the\nresolution refutation by the corresponding projections of the original proof.\n  We present a generalization of CERES (called CERESs) to first-order proof\nschemata and define a schematic version of the sequent calculus called LKS, and\na notion of proof schema based on primitive recursive definitions. A method is\ndeveloped to extract schematic characteristic clause sets and schematic\nprojections from these proof schemata. We also define a schematic resolution\ncalculus for refutation of schemata of clause sets, which can be applied to\nrefute the schematic characteristic clause sets. Finally the projection\nschemata and resolution schemata are plugged together and a schematic\nrepresentation of the atomic cut normal forms is obtained. A major benefit of\nCERESs is the extension of cut-elimination to inductively defined proofs: we\ncompare CERESs with standard calculi using induction rules and demonstrate that\nCERESs is capable of performing cut-elimination where traditional methods fail.\nThe algorithmic handling of CERESs is supported by a recent extension of the\nCERES system."

In this paper, we propose a methodology for the verification\nof conformance of models generated at higher levels of abstraction in the\ndesign process to the design specifications. We model the system behavior using\nsequence of recurrence equations.

However, to make an incomplete\nalgorithm effective one needs to guarantee that the probability of finding a\nbug is reasonably high. We try to achieve such effectiveness by employing the\nTest-As-Proofs (TAP) paradigm. In our TAP based approach, a counterexample is\nbuilt as a sequence of states extracted from proofs that some local variations\nof property P hold. This increases the probability that a) a representative set\nof states is examined and that b) the considered states are relevant to\nproperty P.\n  We describe an algorithm of test generation based on the TAP paradigm and\ngive preliminary experimental results."

Final coalgebra semantics then gives an interpretation function into the\nfinal coalgebra of all languages with the usual output and derivative\noperations. The first characterization is based on systems, where each\nderivative is given as a finite language over the set of nonterminals; the\nsecond characterization on systems where derivatives are given as elements of a\nterm-algebra; and the third characterization is based on adding coalgebraic\nstructure to a class of closed (unique) fixed point expressions. We prove\nequivalences between these characterizations, discuss the generalization from\nlanguages to formal power series, as well as the relationship to the\ngeneralized powerset construction."

    "summary": "It is often useful, if not necessary, to reason about the syntactic structure\nof an expression in an interpreted language (i.e., a language with a\nsemantics). This paper introduces a mathematical structure called a syntax\nframework that is intended to be an abstract model of a system for reasoning\nabout the syntax of an interpreted language. Like many concrete systems for\nreasoning about syntax, a syntax framework contains a mapping of expressions in\nthe interpreted language to syntactic values that represent the syntactic\nstructures of the expressions; a language for reasoning about the syntactic\nvalues; a mechanism called quotation to refer to the syntactic value of an\nexpression; and a mechanism called evaluation to refer to the value of the\nexpression represented by a syntactic value. A syntax framework provides a\nbasis for integrating reasoning about the syntax of the expressions with\nreasoning about what the expressions mean. The notion of a syntax framework is\nused to discuss how quotation and evaluation can be built into a language and\nto define what quasiquotation is. Several examples of syntax frameworks are\npresented."

    "summary": "The pairwise reachability problem for a multi-threaded program asks, given\ncontrol locations in two threads, whether they can be simultaneously reached in\nan execution of the program. The problem is important for static analysis and\nis used to detect statements that are concurrently enabled. This problem is in\ngeneral undecidable even when data is abstracted and when the threads (with\nrecursion) synchronize only using a finite set of locks. Popular programming\nparadigms that limit the lock usage patterns have been identified under which\nthe pairwise reachability problem becomes decidable. In this paper, we consider\na new natural programming paradigm, called contextual locking, which ties the\nlock usage to calling patterns in each thread: we assume that locks are\nreleased in the same context that they were acquired and that every lock\nacquired by a thread in a procedure call is released before the procedure\nreturns. Our main result is that the pairwise reachability problem is\npolynomial-time decidable for this new programming paradigm as well. The\nproblem becomes undecidable if the locks are reentrant; reentrant locking is a\n\\emph{recursive locking} mechanism which allows a thread in a multi-threaded\nprogram to acquire the reentrant lock multiple times."

We present\na novel procedure to efficiently synthesize multiple Boolean control signals\nfrom a specification given as a quantified first-order formula (with a specific\nquantifier structure). Our approach uses uninterpreted functions to abstract\ndetails of the design. We construct an unsatisfiable SMT formula from the given\nspecification. Then, from just one proof of unsatisfiability, we use a variant\nof Craig interpolation to compute multiple coordinated interpolants that\nimplement the Boolean control signals. Our method avoids iterative learning and\nback-substitution of the control functions. We applied our approach to\nsynthesize a controller for a simple two-stage pipelined processor, and present\nfirst experimental results."

    "summary": "The satisfiability problem for branching-time temporal logics like CTL*, CTL\nand CTL+ has important applications in program specification and verification.\nTheir computational complexities are known: CTL* and CTL+ are complete for\ndoubly exponential time, CTL is complete for single exponential time. Some\ndecision procedures for these logics are known; they use tree automata,\ntableaux or axiom systems. In this paper we present a uniform game-theoretic\nframework for the satisfiability problem of these branching-time temporal\nlogics. We define satisfiability games for the full branching-time temporal\nlogic CTL* using a high-level definition of winning condition that captures the\nessence of well-foundedness of least fixpoint unfoldings. These winning\nconditions form formal languages of \\omega-words. We analyse which kinds of\ndeterministic {\\omega}-automata are needed in which case in order to recognise\nthese languages. We then obtain a reduction to the problem of solving parity or\nB\\\"uchi games. The worst-case complexity of the obtained algorithms matches the\nknown lower bounds for these logics. This approach provides a uniform, yet\ncomplexity-theoretically optimal treatment of satisfiability for branching-time\ntemporal logics. It separates the use of temporal logic machinery from the use\nof automata thus preserving a syntactical relationship between the input\nformula and the object that represents satisfiability, i.e. a winning strategy\nin a parity or B\\\"uchi game. The games presented here work on a Fischer-Ladner\nclosure of the input formula only. Last but not least, the games presented here\ncome with an attempt at providing tool support for the satisfiability problem\nof complex branching-time logics like CTL* and CTL+."

The key ingredient of\nany automated verification procedure based on SL is the decidability of the\nentailment problem. In this work, we reduce the entailment problem for a\nnon-trivial subset of SL describing trees (and beyond) to the language\ninclusion of tree automata (TA). Our reduction provides tight complexity bounds\nfor the problem and shows that entailment in our fragment is EXPTIME-complete.\nFor practical purposes, we leverage from recent advances in automata theory,\nsuch as inclusion checking for non-deterministic TA avoiding explicit\ndeterminization. We implemented our method and present promising preliminary\nexperimental results."

The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available,\nand performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding\nprecise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles\nthe case where we may only sample the MDP, and yields probabilistic guarantees,\nagain in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient\nstopping criteria for the approximation. The latter is the first extension of\nstatistical model-checking for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast with\nother related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded\n(finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular properties\nof the MDP.

    "summary": "Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is arguably the archetypical NP-complete\ndecision problem. Progress in SAT solving algorithms has motivated an ever\nincreasing number of practical applications in recent years. However, many\npractical uses of SAT involve solving function as opposed to decision problems.\nConcrete examples include computing minimal unsatisfiable subsets, minimal\ncorrection subsets, prime implicates and implicants, minimal models, backbone\nliterals, and autarkies, among several others. In most cases, solving a\nfunction problem requires a number of adaptive or non-adaptive calls to a SAT\nsolver. Given the computational complexity of SAT, it is therefore important to\ndevelop algorithms that either require the smallest possible number of calls to\nthe SAT solver, or that involve simpler instances. This paper addresses a\nnumber of representative function problems defined on Boolean formulas, and\nshows that all these function problems can be reduced to a generic problem of\ncomputing a minimal set subject to a monotone predicate. This problem is\nreferred to as the Minimal Set over Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem. This\nexercise provides new ways for solving well-known function problems, including\nprime implicates, minimal correction subsets, backbone literals, independent\nvariables and autarkies, among several others. Moreover, this exercise\nmotivates the development of more efficient algorithms for the MSMP problem.\nFinally the paper outlines a number of areas of future research related with\nextensions of the MSMP problem."

    "summary": "Two of the most studied extensions of trace and testing equivalences to\nnondeterministic and probabilistic processes induce distinctions that have been\nquestioned and lack properties that are desirable. Probabilistic\ntrace-distribution equivalence differentiates systems that can perform the same\nset of traces with the same probabilities, and is not a congruence for parallel\ncomposition. Probabilistic testing equivalence, which relies only on extremal\nsuccess probabilities, is backward compatible with testing equivalences for\nrestricted classes of processes, such as fully nondeterministic processes or\ngenerative/reactive probabilistic processes, only if specific sets of tests are\nadmitted. In this paper, new versions of probabilistic trace and testing\nequivalences are presented for the general class of nondeterministic and\nprobabilistic processes. The new trace equivalence is coarser because it\ncompares execution probabilities of single traces instead of entire trace\ndistributions, and turns out to be compositional. The new testing equivalence\nrequires matching all resolutions of nondeterminism on the basis of their\nsuccess probabilities, rather than comparing only extremal success\nprobabilities, and considers success probabilities in a trace-by-trace fashion,\nrather than cumulatively on entire resolutions. It is fully backward compatible\nwith testing equivalences for restricted classes of processes; as a\nconsequence, the trace-by-trace approach uniformly captures the standard\nprobabilistic testing equivalences for generative and reactive probabilistic\nprocesses. The paper discusses in full details the new equivalences and\nprovides a simple spectrum that relates them with existing ones in the setting\nof nondeterministic and probabilistic processes."

We claim that these transitions are always part of the unit\nof a certain monad. Hence, coalgebras with internal moves are exactly\ncoalgebras over a monadic type. The rest of the paper is devoted to supporting\nour claim by studying two important behavioural equivalences for state-based\nsystems with internal moves, namely: weak bisimulation and trace semantics.\n  We continue our research on weak bisimulations for coalgebras over order\nenriched monads. The key notions used in this paper and proposed by us in our\nprevious work are the notions of an order saturation monad and a saturator. A\nsaturator operator can be intuitively understood as a reflexive, transitive\nclosure operator. There are two approaches towards defining saturators for\ncoalgebras with internal moves. Here, we give necessary conditions for them to\nyield the same notion of weak bisimulation.\n  Finally, we propose a definition of trace semantics for coalgebras with\nsilent moves via a uniform fixed point operator.

The state-of-the-art approach for\nbounded model generation for rich knowledge representation languages, like ASP,\nFO(.) and Zinc, is ground-and-solve: reduce the theory to a ground or\npropositional one and apply a search algorithm to the resulting theory.\n  An important bottleneck is the blowup of the size of the theory caused by the\nreduction phase. Lazily grounding the theory during search is a way to overcome\nthis bottleneck. We present a theoretical framework and an implementation in\nthe context of the FO(.) knowledge representation language. Instead of\ngrounding all parts of a theory, justifications are derived for some parts of\nit. Given a partial assignment for the grounded part of the theory and valid\njustifications for the formulas of the non-grounded part, the justifications\nprovide a recipe to construct a complete assignment that satisfies the\nnon-grounded part. When a justification for a particular formula becomes\ninvalid during search, a new one is derived; if that fails, the formula is\nsplit in a part to be grounded and a part that can be justified.\n  The theoretical framework captures existing approaches for tackling the\ngrounding bottleneck such as lazy clause generation and grounding-on-the-fly,\nand presents a generalization of the 2-watched literal scheme.

    "summary": "A rather easy yet rigorous proof of a version of G\\\"odel's first\nincompleteness theorem is presented. The version is \"each recursively\nenumerable theory of natural numbers with 0, 1, +, *, =, logical and, logical\nnot, and the universal quantifier either proves a false sentence or fails to\nprove a true sentence\". The proof proceeds by first showing a similar result on\ntheories of finite character strings, and then transporting it to natural\nnumbers, by using them to model strings and their concatenation. Proof systems\nare expressed via Turing machines that halt if and only if their input string\nis a theorem. This approach makes it possible to present all but one parts of\nthe proof rather briefly with simple and straightforward constructions. The\ndetails require some care, but do not require significant background knowledge.\nThe missing part is the widely known fact that Turing machines can perform\ncomplicated computational tasks."

    "summary": "Dependently typed lambda calculi such as the Logical Framework (LF) are\ncapable of representing relationships between terms through types. By\nexploiting the \"formulas-as-types\" notion, such calculi can also encode the\ncorrespondence between formulas and their proofs in typing judgments. As such,\nthese calculi provide a natural yet powerful means for specifying varied formal\nsystems. Such specifications can be transformed into a more direct form that\nuses predicate formulas over simply typed lambda-terms and that thereby\nprovides the basis for their animation using conventional logic programming\ntechniques. However, a naive use of this idea is fraught with inefficiencies\narising from the fact that dependently typed expressions typically contain much\nredundant typing information. We investigate syntactic criteria for recognizing\nand, hence, eliminating such redundancies. In particular, we identify a\nproperty of bound variables in LF types called \"rigidity\" and formally show\nthat checking that instantiations of such variables adhere to typing\nrestrictions is unnecessary for the purpose of ensuring that the overall\nexpression is well-formed. We show how to exploit this property in a\ntranslation based approach to executing specifications in the Twelf language.\nRecognizing redundancy is also relevant to devising compact representations of\ndependently typed expressions. We highlight this aspect of our work and discuss\nits connection with other approaches proposed in this context."

The\nproblem consists in finding the \"best\" solution according to some criteria, to\ninstall, remove or upgrade packages in a given installation. This is a\ndifficult problem: the complexity of the upgradeability problem is NP complete\nand modern OS contain a huge number of packages (often more than 20 000\npackages in a Linux distribution). Moreover, several optimisation criteria have\nto be considered, e.g., stability, memory efficiency, network efficiency.

Upgrades are required on\na short time basis and systems are expected to be reliable and consistent after\nthat. For each package in the system, a set of dependencies and a set of\nconflicts have to be taken into account. Although this problem is\ncomputationally hard to solve, efficient tools are required. In the best\nscenario, the solutions provided should also be optimal in order to better\nfulfill users requirements and expectations. This paper describes two different\ntools, both based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT), for solving Linux\nupgradeability problems. The problem instances used in the evaluation of these\ntools were mainly obtained from real environments, and are subject to two\ndifferent lexicographic optimization criteria. The developed tools can provide\noptimal solutions for many of the instances, but a few challenges remain.\nMoreover, it is our understanding that this problem has many similarities with\nother configuration problems, and therefore the same techniques can be used in\nother domains."

We interpret a well-studied abstraction of\nnanomolecular self assembly, the Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), into\nComputation Tree Logic (CTL), a temporal logic often used in model checking. We\nthen consider the class of \"rectilinear\" tile assembly systems. This class\nincludes most aTAM systems studied in the theoretical literature, and all\n(algorithmic) DNA tile self-assembling systems that have been realized in\nlaboratories to date. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a tile\nassembly system T as input, either provides a counterexample to T's\nrectilinearity or verifies whether T has a unique terminal assembly. Using\npartial order reductions, the verification search space for this algorithm is\nreduced from exponential size to O(n^2), where n x n is the size of the\nassembly surface. That reduction is asymptotically the best possible. We report\non experimental results obtained by translating tile assembly simulator files\ninto a Petri net format manipulable by the SMART model checking engines devised\nby Ciardo et al. The model checker runs in O(|T| x n^4) time, where |T| is the\nnumber of tile types in tile assembly system T, and n x n is the surface size.\nAtypical for a model checking problem -- in which the practical limit usually\nis insufficient memory to store the state space -- the limit in this case was\nthe amount of memory required to represent the rules of the model. (Storage of\nthe state space and of the reachability graph were small by comparison.) We\ndiscuss how to overcome this obstacle by means of a front end tailored to the\ncharacteristics of self-assembly."

    "summary": "Terms are a concise representation of tree structures. Since they can be\nnaturally defined by an inductive type, they offer data structures in\nfunctional programming and mechanised reasoning with useful principles such as\nstructural induction and structural recursion. However, for graphs or\n\"tree-like\" structures - trees involving cycles and sharing - it remains\nunclear what kind of inductive structures exists and how we can faithfully\nassign a term representation of them. In this paper we propose a simple term\nsyntax for cyclic sharing structures that admits structural induction and\nrecursion principles. We show that the obtained syntax is directly usable in\nthe functional language Haskell and the proof assistant Agda, as well as\nordinary data structures such as lists and trees. To achieve this goal, we use\na categorical approach to initial algebra semantics in a presheaf category.\nThat approach follows the line of Fiore, Plotkin and Turi's models of abstract\nsyntax with variable binding."

    "summary": "We study the decidability of termination for two CHR dialects which,\nsimilarly to the Datalog like languages, are defined by using a signature which\ndoes not allow function symbols (of arity >0). Both languages allow the use of\nthe = built-in in the body of rules, thus are built on a host language that\nsupports unification. However each imposes one further restriction. The first\nCHR dialect allows only range-restricted rules, that is, it does not allow the\nuse of variables in the body or in the guard of a rule if they do not appear in\nthe head. We show that the existence of an infinite computation is decidable\nfor this dialect. The second dialect instead limits the number of atoms in the\nhead of rules to one. We prove that in this case, the existence of a\nterminating computation is decidable. These results show that both dialects are\nstrictly less expressive than Turing Machines. It is worth noting that the\nlanguage (without function symbols) without these restrictions is as expressive\nas Turing Machines."

There is a natural algebraic theory of the\nconstructors whose free algebra functor is Moggi's monad; we illustrate this by\ncharacterising free and initial algebras in terms of two versions of the stable\nfailures model of CSP, one more general than the other. Deconstructors are\ndealt with as homomorphisms to (possibly non-free) algebras.\n  One can view CSP's action and choice operators as constructors and the rest,\nsuch as concealment and concurrency, as deconstructors. Carrying this programme\nout results in taking deterministic external choice as constructor rather than\ngeneral external choice. However, binary deconstructors, such as the CSP\nconcurrency operator, provide unresolved difficulties. We conclude by\npresenting a combination of CSP with Moggi's computational {\\lambda}-calculus,\nin which the operators, including concurrency, are polymorphic. While the paper\nmainly concerns CSP, it ought to be possible to carry over similar ideas to\nother process calculi."

The semantical types which are interpretations of logical formulas enjoy\na fundamental property, called internal completeness, which characterizes\nludics and sets it apart also from realizability. Internal completeness entails\nstandard full completeness as a consequence. A growing body of work start to\nexplore the potential of this specific interactive approach. However, ludics\nhas some limitations, which are consequence of the fact that in the original\nformulation, strategies are abstractions of MALL proofs. On one side, no\nrepetitions are allowed. On the other side, the proofs tend to rely on the very\nspecific properties of the MALL proof-like strategies, making it difficult to\ntransfer the approach to semantical types into different settings. In this\npaper, we provide an extension of ludics which allows repetitions and show that\none can still have interactive types and internal completeness. From this, we\nobtain full completeness w.r.t. a polarized version of MELL. In our extension,\nwe use less properties than in the original formulation, which we believe is of\nindependent interest.

In this paper, we propose such an efficient polynomial-time\napproximation algorithm for full CSL. The key to our method is the notion of\nstratified CTMCs with respect to the CSL property to be checked. On a\nstratified CTMC, the probability to satisfy a CSL path formula can be\napproximated by a transient analysis in polynomial time (using uniformization).\nWe present a measure-preserving, linear-time and -space transformation of any\nCTMC into an equivalent, stratified one.

As a first\nstep in that direction, we introduce lambda-mu-T, a combination of Parigot's\nlambda-mu-calculus and G\\\"odel's T, to extend a calculus with control operators\nwith a datatype of natural numbers with a primitive recursor.\n  We consider the problem of confluence on raw terms, and that of strong\nnormalization for the well-typed terms. Observing some problems with extending\nthe proofs of Baba at al. and Parigot's original confluence proof, we provide\nnew, and improved, proofs of confluence (by complete developments) and strong\nnormalization (by reducibility and a postponement argument) for our system.\n  We conclude with some remarks about extensions, choices, and prospects for an\nimproved presentation."

In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to obtain quantifier-free interpolants for a\nSkolemized version of the extensional theory of arrays. We prove this in two\nways: (1) non-constructively, by using the model theoretic notion of\namalgamation, which is known to be equivalent to admit quantifier-free\ninterpolation for universal theories; and (2) constructively, by designing an\ninterpolating procedure, based on solving equations between array updates.\n(Interestingly, rewriting techniques are used in the key steps of the solver\nand its proof of correctness.) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nsuccessful attempt of computing quantifier- free interpolants for a variant of\nthe theory of arrays with extensionality."

We consider a proof\ntheory, in nested sequent calculus, of grammar logics with converse, i.e.,\nevery modal operator [a] comes with a converse. Extending previous works on\nnested sequent systems for tense logics, we show all grammar logics (with or\nwithout converse) can be formalised in nested sequent calculi, where the axioms\nare internalised in the calculi as structural rules. Syntactic cut-elimination\nfor these calculi is proved using a procedure similar to that for display\nlogics. If the grammar is context-free, then one can get rid of all structural\nrules, in favor of deep inference and additional propagation rules. We give a\nnovel semi-decision procedure for context-free grammar logics, using nested\nsequent calculus with deep inference, and show that, in the case where the\ngiven context-free grammar is regular, this procedure terminates. Unlike all\nother existing decision procedures for regular grammar logics in the\nliterature, our procedure does not assume that a finite state automaton\nencoding the axioms is given."

This restriction\nprohibits the encoding of probabilistic model checkers, where explanations\ncorrespond to executions of the system being model checked. To overcome this\nrestriction, we propose a more general inference algorithm that uses finite\ngenerative structures (similar to automata) to represent families of\nexplanations. The inference algorithm computes the probability of a possibly\ninfinite set of explanations directly from the finite generative structure. We\nhave implemented our inference algorithm in XSB Prolog, and use this\nimplementation to encode probabilistic model checkers for a variety of temporal\nlogics, including PCTL and GPL (which subsumes PCTL*).

    "summary": "In the manuscript titled \"Computation environment (1)\", we introduced a\nnotion called computation environment as an interactive model for computation\nand complexity theory. In this model, Turing machines are not autonomous\nentities and find their meanings through the interaction between a computist\nand a universal processor, and thus due to evolution of the universal\nprocessor, the meanings of Turing machines could change. In this manuscript, we\ndiscuss persistently evolutionary intensions. We introduce a new semantics,\ncalled persistently evolutionary semantics, for predicate logic that the\nmeaning of function and predicate symbols are not already predetermined, and\npredicate and function symbols find their meaning through the interaction of\nthe subject with the language. In (classic) model theory, the mathematician who\nstudies a structure is assumed as a god who lives out of the structure, and the\nstudy of the mathematician does not effect the structure. The meaning of\npredicate and function symbols are assumed to be independent of the\nmathematician who does math. The persistently evolutionary semantics could be\nregarded as a start of \"Interactive Model Theory\" as a new paradigm in model\ntheory (similar to the paradigm of interactive computation). In interactive\nmodel theory, we suppose that a mathematical structure should consist of two\nparts: 1) an intelligent agent (a subject), and 2) an environment (language),\nand every things should find its meaning through the interaction of these two\nparts. We introduce persistently evolutionary Kripke structure for\npropositional and predicate logic. Also, we propose a persistently evolutionary\nKripke semantics for the notion of computation, where the intension of a code\nof a Turing machine persistently evolve. We show that in this Kripke model the\nsubject can never know P = NP."

However, it is\nnot a congruence with respect to parallel composition. In this paper, we show\nhow to generalize the equivalence in a way that a reasonable tradeoff among\nabstraction, compositionality, and exactness is achieved for concurrent\nprocesses. We will see that, by enhancing the abstraction capability in the\npresence of concurrent computations, it is possible to retrieve the congruence\nproperty with respect to parallel composition, with the resulting CTMC-level\naggregation being exact at steady state only for a certain subset of the\nconsidered processes."

    "summary": "Quantitative model checkers for Markov Decision Processes typically use\nfinite-precision arithmetic. If all the coefficients in the process are\nrational numbers, then the model checking results are rational, and so they can\nbe computed exactly. However, exact techniques are generally too expensive or\nlimited in scalability. In this paper we propose a method for obtaining exact\nresults starting from an approximated solution in finite-precision arithmetic.\nThe input of the method is a description of a scheduler, which can be obtained\nby a model checker using finite precision. Given a scheduler, we show how to\nobtain a corresponding basis in a linear-programming problem, in such a way\nthat the basis is optimal whenever the scheduler attains the worst-case\nprobability. This correspondence is already known for discounted MDPs, we show\nhow to apply it in the undiscounted case provided that some preprocessing is\ndone. Using the correspondence, the linear-programming problem can be solved in\nexact arithmetic starting from the basis obtained. As a consequence, the method\nfinds the worst-case probability even if the scheduler provided by the model\nchecker was not optimal. In our experiments, the calculation of exact solutions\nfrom a candidate scheduler is significantly faster than the calculation using\nthe simplex method under exact arithmetic starting from a default basis."

In turn, process fragments are connected graphs annotated with\ninstructions to modify data. Correctness properties concerning the evolution of\ndata with respect to processes can be stated in a first-order branching-time\nlogic over built-in theories, such as linear integer arithmetic, records and\narrays.\n  Solving general model checking problems over this logic is considerably\nharder than model checking when a concrete initial state is given.

    "summary": "Traditionally, transfer functions have been designed manually for each\noperation in a program, instruction by instruction. In such a setting, a\ntransfer function describes the semantics of a single instruction, detailing\nhow a given abstract input state is mapped to an abstract output state. The net\neffect of a sequence of instructions, a basic block, can then be calculated by\ncomposing the transfer functions of the constituent instructions. However,\nprecision can be improved by applying a single transfer function that captures\nthe semantics of the block as a whole. Since blocks are program-dependent, this\napproach necessitates automation. There has thus been growing interest in\ncomputing transfer functions automatically, most notably using techniques based\non quantifier elimination. Although conceptually elegant, quantifier\nelimination inevitably induces a computational bottleneck, which limits the\napplicability of these methods to small blocks. This paper contributes a method\nfor calculating transfer functions that finesses quantifier elimination\naltogether, and can thus be seen as a response to this problem. The\npracticality of the method is demonstrated by generating transfer functions for\ninput and output states that are described by linear template constraints,\nwhich include intervals and octagons."

When the interaction between two designs goes well, such two designs\nare said to be orthogonal. A behaviour is a set of designs closed under\nbi-orthogonality. Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally\nproofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties. In that\nway, designs are more general than proofs and we may notice in particular that\nthey are not typed objects. Incarnation is introduced by Girard in Ludics as a\ncharacterization of \"useful\" designs in a behaviour. The incarnation of a\ndesign is defined as its subdesign that is the smallest one in the behaviour\nordered by inclusion. It is useful in particular because being \"incarnated\" is\none of the conditions for a design to denote a proof of a formula. The\ncomputation of incarnation is important also as it gives a minimal denotation\nfor a formula, and more generally for a behaviour. We give here a constructive\nway to capture the incarnation of the behaviour of a set of designs, without\ncomputing the behaviour itself. The method we follow uses an alternative\ndefinition of designs: rather than defining them as sets of chronicles, we\nconsider them as sets of paths, a concept very close to that of play in game\nsemantics that allows an easier handling of the interaction: the unfolding of\ninteraction is a path common to two interacting designs."

Thus, we can embed first-order Intuitionistic Linear\nLogic into this system, Polarized Linear Logic, and an imperative total\nprogramming language.\n  The proof system has a tight connection with a simple game model, where games\nare forests of plays. Formulas are modelled as games, and proofs as\nhistory-sensitive winning strategies. We provide a strong full completeness\nresult with respect to this model: each finitary strategy is the denotation of\na unique analytic (cut-free) proof. Infinite strategies correspond to analytic\nproofs that are infinitely deep. Thus, we can normalise proofs, via the\nsemantics."

    "summary": "Verification methods based on SAT, SMT, and Theorem Proving often rely on\nproofs of unsatisfiability as a powerful tool to extract information in order\nto reduce the overall effort. For example a proof may be traversed to identify\na minimal reason that led to unsatisfiability, for computing abstractions, or\nfor deriving Craig interpolants. In this paper we focus on two important\naspects that concern efficient handling of proofs of unsatisfiability:\ncompression and manipulation. First of all, since the proof size can be very\nlarge in general (exponential in the size of the input problem), it is indeed\nbeneficial to adopt techniques to compress it for further processing. Secondly,\nproofs can be manipulated as a flexible preprocessing step in preparation for\ninterpolant computation. Both these techniques are implemented in a framework\nthat makes use of local rewriting rules to transform the proofs. We show that a\ncareful use of the rules, combined with existing algorithms, can result in an\neffective simplification of the original proofs. We have evaluated several\nheuristics on a wide range of unsatisfiable problems deriving from SAT and SMT\ntest cases."

First, we present a dual to the sound induction rule for\ninductive types that we developed previously. That is, we present a sound\ncoinduction rule for any data type arising as the carrier of the final\ncoalgebra of a functor, thus relaxing Hermida and Jacobs' restriction to\npolynomial functors. To achieve this we introduce the notion of a quotient\ncategory with equality (QCE) that i) abstracts the standard notion of a\nfibration of relations constructed from a given fibration; and ii) plays a role\nin the theory of coinduction dual to that played by a comprehension category\nwith unit (CCU) in the theory of induction. Secondly, we show that inductive\nand coinductive indexed types also admit sound induction and coinduction rules.\nIndexed data types often arise as carriers of initial algebras and final\ncoalgebras of functors on slice categories, so we give sufficient conditions\nunder which we can construct, from a CCU (QCE) U:E \\rightarrow B, a fibration\nwith base B/I that models indexing by I and is also a CCU (resp., QCE). We\nfinish the paper by considering the more general case of sound induction and\ncoinduction rules for indexed data types when the indexing is itself given by a\nfibration."

    "summary": "The problem of model-checking hybrid systems is a long-time challenge in the\nscientific community. Most of the existing approaches and tools are either\nlimited on the properties that they can verify, or restricted to simplified\nclasses of systems. To overcome those limitations, a temporal logic called\nHyLTL has been recently proposed. The model checking problem for this logic has\nbeen solved by translating the formula into an equivalent hybrid automaton,\nthat can be analized using existing tools. The original construction employs a\ndeclarative procedure that generates exponentially many states upfront, and can\nbe very inefficient when complex formulas are involved. In this paper we solve\na technical issue in the construction that was not considered in previous\nworks, and propose a new algorithm to translate HyLTL into hybrid automata,\nthat exploits optimized techniques coming from the discrete LTL community to\nbuild smaller automata."

To satisfy the specification, the program needs to act so that the\nspecification holds in every computation generated by its interaction with the\nenvironment. Often, the program cannot observe all attributes of its\nenvironment. In this case, we should transform a specification into a program\nwhose behavior depends only on the observable history of the computation. This\nis called synthesis with incomplete information. In such a setting, it is\ndesirable to have a knowledge-based specification, which can refer to the\nuncertainty the program has about the environment's behavior.

    "summary": "Linearisability has become the standard correctness criterion for concurrent\ndata structures, ensuring that every history of invocations and responses of\nconcurrent operations has a matching sequential history. Existing proofs of\nlinearisability require one to identify so-called linearisation points within\nthe operations under consideration, which are atomic statements whose execution\ncauses the effect of an operation to be felt. However, identification of\nlinearisation points is a non-trivial task, requiring a high degree of\nexpertise. For sophisticated algorithms such as Heller et al's lazy set, it\neven is possible for an operation to be linearised by the concurrent execution\nof a statement outside the operation being verified. This paper proposes an\nalternative method for verifying linearisability that does not require\nidentification of linearisation points. Instead, using an interval-based logic,\nwe show that every behaviour of each concrete operation over any interval is a\npossible behaviour of a corresponding abstraction that executes with\ncoarse-grained atomicity. This approach is applied to Heller et al's lazy set\nto show that verification of linearisability is possible without having to\nconsider linearisation points within the program code."

In many cases, such a sequence is\nintended to approximate a certain limit case. However, formally defining that\nlimit turns out to be subject to ambiguity. Depending on the interpretation of\nthe sequence, i.e. depending on how the behaviors of the systems in the\nsequence are related, it may vary what the limit should be. Topologies, and in\nparticular metrics, define limits uniquely, if they exist. Thus they select one\ninterpretation implicitly and leave no room for other interpretations. In this\npaper, we define limits using category theory, and use the mentioned relations\nbetween system behaviors explicitly. This resolves the problem of ambiguity in\na more controlled way. We introduce a category of prefix orders on executions\nand partial history preserving maps between them to describe both discrete and\ncontinuous branching time dynamics. We prove that in this category all\nprojective limits exist, and illustrate how ambiguity in the definition of\nlimits is resolved using an example.

    "summary": "This paper investigates type isomorphism in a lambda-calculus with\nintersection and union types. It is known that in lambda-calculus, the\nisomorphism between two types is realised by a pair of terms inverse one each\nother. Notably, invertible terms are linear terms of a particular shape, called\nfinite hereditary permutators. Typing properties of finite hereditary\npermutators are then studied in a relevant type inference system with\nintersection and union types for linear terms. In particular, an isomorphism\npreserving reduction between types is defined. Type reduction is confluent and\nterminating, and induces a notion of normal form of types. The properties of\nnormal types are a crucial step toward the complete characterisation of type\nisomorphism. The main results of this paper are, on one hand, the fact that two\ntypes with the same normal form are isomorphic, on the other hand, the\ncharacterisation of the isomorphism between types in normal form, modulo\nisomorphism of arrow types."

They come in various flavors: polynomial interpretations\nwith real, rational and integer coefficients. As to their relationship with\nrespect to termination proving power, Lucas managed to prove in 2006 that there\nare rewrite systems that can be shown polynomially terminating by polynomial\ninterpretations with real (algebraic) coefficients, but cannot be shown\npolynomially terminating using polynomials with rational coefficients only. He\nalso proved the corresponding statement regarding the use of rational\ncoefficients versus integer coefficients. In this article we extend these\nresults, thereby giving the full picture of the relationship between the\naforementioned variants of polynomial interpretations.

    "summary": "First-order temporal logics are notorious for their bad computational\nbehaviour. It is known that even the two-variable monadic fragment is highly\nundecidable over various linear timelines, and over branching time even\none-variable fragments might be undecidable. However, there have been several\nattempts on finding well-behaved fragments of first-order temporal logics and\nrelated temporal description logics, mostly either by restricting the available\nquantifier patterns, or considering sub-Boolean languages. Here we analyse\nseemingly `mild' extensions of decidable one-variable fragments with counting\ncapabilities, interpreted in models with constant, decreasing, and expanding\nfirst-order domains. We show that over most classes of linear orders these\nlogics are (sometimes highly) undecidable, even without constant and function\nsymbols, and with the sole temporal operator `eventually'.\n  We establish connections with bimodal logics over 2D product structures\nhaving linear and `difference' (inequality) component relations, and prove our\nresults in this bimodal setting. We show a general result saying that\nsatisfiability over many classes of bimodal models with commuting linear and\ndifference relations is undecidable. As a by-product, we also obtain new\nexamples of finitely axiomatisable but Kripke incomplete bimodal logics. Our\nresults generalise similar lower bounds on bimodal logics over products of two\nlinear relations, and our proof methods are quite different from the proofs of\nthese results. Unlike previous proofs that first `diagonally encode' an\ninfinite grid, and then use reductions of tiling or Turing machine problems,\nhere we make direct use of the grid-like structure of product frames and obtain\nundecidability by reductions of counter (Minsky) machine problems."

    "summary": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the bottom-up evaluation\nof the semantics of logic programs with complex terms. The presence of function\nsymbols in the program may render the ground instantiation infinite, and\nfiniteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure, in the\ngeneral case, are not guaranteed anymore. Since the program termination problem\nis undecidable in the general case, several decidable criteria (called program\ntermination criteria) have been recently proposed. However, current conditions\nare not able to identify even simple programs, whose bottom-up execution always\nterminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checking\ntermination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation,\nby deeply analyzing the program structure. First, we analyze the propagation of\ncomplex terms among arguments by means of the extended version of the argument\ngraph called propagation graph. The resulting criterion, called\nGamma-acyclicity, generalizes most of the decidable criteria proposed so far.\nNext, we study how rules may activate each other and define a more powerful\ncriterion, called safety. This criterion uses the so-called safety function\nable to analyze how rules may activate each other and how the presence of some\narguments in a rule limits its activation. We also study the application of the\nproposed criteria to bound queries and show that the safety criterion is\nwell-suited to identify relevant classes of programs and bound queries.\nFinally, we propose a hierarchy of classes of terminating programs, called\nk-safety, where the k-safe class strictly includes the (k-1)-safe class.

In the context of networked software\nservices, a widespread programming language-based approach relies on global\nspecifications defined by session types or behavioral contracts. Static type\nchecking can then be used to ensure that components follow the prescribed\ninteraction protocols. In the case of session types, developments have been\nmostly framed within quite different type theories for either binary\n(two-party) or multiparty (n-party) protocols. Unfortunately, the precise\nrelationship between analysis techniques for multiparty and binary protocols is\nyet to be understood.\n  In this work, we bridge this previously open gap in a principled way: we show\nthat the analysis of multiparty protocols can also be developed within a much\nsimpler type theory for binary protocols, ensuring protocol fidelity and\ndeadlock-freedom. We present characterization theorems which provide new\ninsights on the relation between two existing, yet very differently motivated,\nsession type systems---one based on linear logic, the other based on automata\ntheory---and suggest useful type-based verification techniques for multiparty\nsystems relying on reductions to the binary case."

    "summary": "The Termination Theorem by Podelski and Rybalchenko states that the reduction\nrelations which are terminating from any initial state are exactly the\nreduction relations whose transitive closure, restricted to the accessible\nstates, is included in some finite union of well-founded relations. An\nalternative statement of the theorem is that terminating reduction relations\nare precisely those having a \"disjunctively well-founded transition invariant\".\nFrom this result the same authors and Byron Cook designed an algorithm checking\na sufficient condition for termination for a while-if program. The algorithm\nlooks for a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant, made of\nwell-founded relations of height omega, and if it finds it, it deduces the\ntermination for the while-if program using the Termination Theorem.\n  This raises an interesting question: What is the status of reduction\nrelations having a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant where each\nrelation has height omega? An answer to this question can lead to a\ncharacterization of the set of while-if programs which the termination\nalgorithm can prove to be terminating. The goal of this work is to prove that\nthey are exactly the set of reduction relations having height omega^n for some\nn < omega. Besides, if all the relations in the transition invariant are\nprimitive recursive and the reduction relation is the graph of the restriction\nto some primitive recursive set of a primitive recursive map, then a final\nstate is computable by some primitive recursive map in the initial state.\n  As a corollary we derive that the set of functions, having at least one\nimplementation in Podelski Rybalchenko while-if language with a well-founded\ndisjunctively transition invariant where each relation has height omega, is\nexactly the set of primitive recursive functions."

We solve the PQE problem by\ngenerating and adding to F clauses over the free variables that make the\nclauses of F with quantified variables redundant. The traditional Quantifier\nElimination problem (QE) is a special case of PQE where G is empty so all\nclauses of the input formula with quantified variables need to be made\nredundant. The importance of PQE is twofold. First, many problems are more\nnaturally formulated in terms of PQE rather than QE. Second, in many cases PQE\ncan be solved more efficiently than QE. We describe a PQE algorithm based on\nthe machinery of dependency sequents and give experimental results showing the\npromise of PQE."

For example, there is no natural point on a geometric circle\n--- no point on a geometric circle can be named by a well-typed expression.\nSimilarly it is not possible to name any particular basis for a vector space or\nany particular isomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space with its dual.\nHomotopy type theory (HoTT) also provides a formal account of isomorphism but\nextends constructive logic rather than classical predicate calculus.

    "summary": "Church's Higher Order Logic is a basis for influential proof assistants --\nHOL and PVS. Church's logic has a simple set-theoretic semantics, making it\ntrustworthy and extensible. We factor HOL into a constructive core plus axioms\nof excluded middle and choice. We similarly factor standard set theory, ZFC,\ninto a constructive core, IZF, and axioms of excluded middle and choice. Then\nwe provide the standard set-theoretic semantics in such a way that the\nconstructive core of HOL is mapped into IZF. We use the disjunction, numerical\nexistence and term existence properties of IZF to provide a program extraction\ncapability from proofs in the constructive core.\n  We can implement the disjunction and numerical existence properties in two\ndifferent ways: one using Rathjen's realizability for IZF and the other using a\nnew direct weak normalization result for IZF by Moczydlowski. The latter can\nalso be used for the term existence property."

We interpret the recursive types as information\nsystems in a restricted form, which we call prime systems. A denotational\nsemantics is defined with this interpretation. We define the syntactical normal\nform approximations of a term and prove the Approximation Theorem: The\nsemantics of a term equals the limit of the semantics of its approximations.\nThe proof uses inclusive predicates (logical relations).

In this paper we introduce unifying framework, the\nlogic with iteration operator, in which iteration steps may be accessed by\ntemporal logic formulae. We show that proposed logic FO+TAI subsumes all\nmentioned fixed point extensions as well as many other fixed point logics as\nnatural fragments. On the other hand we show that over finite structures FO+TAI\nis no more expressive than FO+PFP. Further we show that adding the same\nmachinery to the logic of monotone inductions (FO+LFP) does not increase its\nexpressive power either."

We show that satisfiability over\ntransitive frames for the hybrid language extended with the downarrow operator\nis NEXPTIME-complete. This is in contrast to undecidability of satisfiability\nover arbitrary frames for this language (Areces, Blackburn, Marx 1999). It is\nalso shown that adding the @ operator or the past modality leads to\nundecidability over transitive frames. This is again in contrast to the case of\ntransitive trees and linear frames, where we show these languages to be\nnonelementarily decidable. Moreover, we establish 2EXPTIME and EXPTIME upper\nbounds for satisfiability over transitive frames and transitive trees,\nrespectively, for the hybrid Until/Since language. An EXPTIME lower bound is\nshown to hold for the modal Until language over both frame classes."

    "summary": "We consider two-player games played over finite state spaces for an infinite\nnumber of rounds. At each state, the players simultaneously choose moves; the\nmoves determine a successor state. It is often advantageous for players to\nchoose probability distributions over moves, rather than single moves. Given a\ngoal, for example, reach a target state, the question of winning is thus a\nprobabilistic one: what is the maximal probability of winning from a given\nstate?\n  On these game structures, two fundamental notions are those of equivalences\nand metrics. Given a set of winning conditions, two states are equivalent if\nthe players can win the same games with the same probability from both states.\nMetrics provide a bound on the difference in the probabilities of winning\nacross states, capturing a quantitative notion of state similarity.\n  We introduce equivalences and metrics for two-player game structures, and we\nshow that they characterize the difference in probability of winning games\nwhose goals are expressed in the quantitative mu-calculus. The quantitative\nmu-calculus can express a large set of goals, including reachability, safety,\nand omega-regular properties. Thus, we claim that our relations and metrics\nprovide the canonical extensions to games, of the classical notion of\nbisimulation for transition systems. We develop our results both for\nequivalences and metrics, which generalize bisimulation, and for asymmetrical\nversions, which generalize simulation."

In this paper we provide an implementable\nformal algorithm for knowledge base equivalence verification based on the\nformal definition of knowledge base proposed by Plotkin B. and Plotkin T., and\nstudy some important properties of automorphic equivalence of models.

The formalised algorithms are only partially\nproductive, i.e., they do not output provably infinite streams for all possible\ninputs. We show how to deal with this partiality in the presence of syntactic\nrestrictions posed by the constructive type theory of Coq.
