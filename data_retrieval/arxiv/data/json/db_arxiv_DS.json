Here searching an\ninteger y means finding the maximum key in the set which is smaller than or\nequal to y. This problem is equivalent to the standard text book problem of\nmaintaining an ordered set (see, e.g., Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:\nIntroduction to Algorithms, 2nd ed., MIT Press, 2001).\n  The best previous deterministic linear space bound was O(log n/loglog n) due\nFredman and Willard from STOC 1990.

The query performance of the cache-oblivious layout is within a\nconstant factor of the query performance of the optimal known-block-size\nlayout.

    "summary": "We introduce top trees as a design of a new simpler interface for data\nstructures maintaining information in a fully-dynamic forest. We demonstrate\nhow easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For\nexample, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree\nin the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and\nby changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported in O(log n)\ntime, where n is the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show\nhow to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with\nrespect to arbitrary roots in O(log n) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked\nvertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The\nlater has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs,\nand thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.\n  Technically speaking, top trees are easily implemented either with\nFrederickson's topology trees [Ambivalent Data Structures for Dynamic\n2-Edge-Connectivity and k Smallest Spanning Trees, SIAM J.

    "summary": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are emerging as an effective means for\nenvironment monitoring. This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient\nmonitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates\nthe covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage\nof the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds\nupon previous work in \"Power Efficient Organization of Wireless Sensor\nNetworks\" by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak, where the model is first formulated. We\nhave designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the SET K-COVER\nproblem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that\nthe number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized.\nThe first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation,\nwithin a fraction 1 - 1/e (~.63) of the optimum. We present two other\ndeterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm\nwith a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm\nwith a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-Complete to guarantee\nbetter than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms\nperform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible.\nSimulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far\nabove their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is\ncovered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in\nlongevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The\nalgorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly\nincrease the longevity of sensor networks. The randomized algorithm in\nparticular seems quite practical.",

    "summary": "An optimization problem that naturally arises in the study of swarm robotics\nis the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) of how to awaken a set of ``asleep'' robots, by\nhaving an awakened robot move to their locations. Once a robot is awake, it can\nassist in awakening other slumbering robots.The objective is to have all robots\nawake as early as possible. While the FTP bears some resemblance to problems\nfrom areas in combinatorial optimization such as routing, broadcasting,\nscheduling, and covering, its algorithmic characteristics are surprisingly\ndifferent. We consider both scenarios on graphs and in geometric\nenvironments.In graphs, robots sleep at vertices and there is a length function\non the edges. Awake robots travel along edges, with time depending on edge\nlength. For most scenarios, we consider the offline version of the problem, in\nwhich each awake robot knows the position of all other robots. We prove that\nthe problem is NP-hard, even for the special case of star graphs. We also\nestablish hardness of approximation, showing that it is NP-hard to obtain an\napproximation factor better than 5/3, even for graphs of bounded degree.These\nlower bounds are complemented with several positive algorithmic results,\nincluding: (1) We show that the natural greedy strategy on star graphs has a\ntight worst-case performance of 7/3 and give a polynomial-time approximation\nscheme (PTAS) for star graphs.

It\nis well-known that instead of using a single hash function if we randomly hash\na ball into two bins and place it in the smaller of the two, then this\ndramatically lowers the maximum load on bins. This leads to the concept of\ntwo-way hashing where the largest bucket contains $O(\\log\\log n)$ balls with\nhigh probability. The hash look up will now search in both the buckets an item\nhashes to. Since an item may be placed in one of two buckets, we could\npotentially move an item after it has been initially placed to reduce maximum\nload. with a maximum load of We show that by performing moves during inserts, a\nmaximum load of 2 can be maintained on-line, with high probability, while\nsupporting hash update operations. In fact, with $n$ buckets, even if the space\nfor two items are pre-allocated per bucket, as may be desirable in hardware\nimplementations, more than $n$ items can be stored giving a high memory\nutilization. We also analyze the trade-off between the number of moves\nperformed during inserts and the maximum load on a bucket. By performing at\nmost $h$ moves, we can maintain a maximum load of $O(\\frac{\\log \\log n}{h\n\\log(\\log\\log n/h)})$.

    "summary": "Histograms are used to summarize the contents of relations into a number of\nbuckets for the estimation of query result sizes. Several techniques (e.g.,\nMaxDiff and V-Optimal) have been proposed in the past for determining bucket\nboundaries which provide accurate estimations. However, while search strategies\nfor optimal bucket boundaries are rather sophisticated, no much attention has\nbeen paid for estimating queries inside buckets and all of the above techniques\nadopt naive methods for such an estimation. This paper focuses on the problem\nof improving the estimation inside a bucket once its boundaries have been\nfixed. The proposed technique is based on the addition, to each bucket, of\n32-bit additional information (organized into a 4-level tree index), storing\napproximate cumulative frequencies at 7 internal intervals of the bucket. Both\ntheoretical analysis and experimental results show that, among a number of\nalternative ways to organize the additional information, the 4-level tree index\nprovides the best frequency estimation inside a bucket. The index is later\nadded to two well-known histograms, MaxDiff and V-Optimal, obtaining the\nnon-obvious result that despite the spatial cost of 4LT which reduces the\nnumber of allowed buckets once the storage space has been fixed, the original\nmethods are strongly improved in terms of accuracy.",

Range searching is a natural and fundamental variant of integer\nsearch, and can be solved using predecessor search. However, for a RAM with\nw-bit words, we show how to perform updates in O(lg w) time and answer queries\nin O(lglg w) time. The update time is identical to the van Emde Boas structure,\nbut the query time is exponentially faster. Existing lower bounds show that\nachieving our query time for predecessor search requires doubly-exponentially\nslower updates. We present some arguments supporting the conjecture that our\nsolution is optimal.\n  Our solution is based on a new and interesting recursion idea which is \"more\nextreme\" that the van Emde Boas recursion. Whereas van Emde Boas uses a simple\nrecursion (repeated halving) on each path in a trie, we use a nontrivial, van\nEmde Boas-like recursion on every such path. Despite this, our algorithm is\nquite clean when seen from the right angle. To achieve linear space for our\ndata structure, we solve a problem which is of independent interest. We develop\nthe first scheme for dynamic perfect hashing requiring sublinear space. This\ngives a dynamic Bloomier filter (an approximate storage scheme for sparse\nvectors) which uses low space. We strengthen previous lower bounds to show that\nthese results are optimal.",

The basic setup here is that we are given as\ninput a complete graph on n nodes (which correspond to nodes to be clustered)\nwhose edges are labeled + (for similar pairs of items) and - (for dissimilar\npairs of items). Thus we have only as input qualitative information on\nsimilarity and no quantitative distance measure between items. The quality of a\nclustering is measured in terms of its number of agreements, which is simply\nthe number of edges it correctly classifies, that is the sum of number of -\nedges whose endpoints it places in different clusters plus the number of +\nedges both of whose endpoints it places within the same cluster.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of finding clusterings that maximize the\nnumber of agreements, and the complementary minimization version where we seek\nclusterings that minimize the number of disagreements. We focus on the\nsituation when the number of clusters is stipulated to be a small constant k.\nOur main result is that for every k, there is a polynomial time approximation\nscheme for both maximizing agreements and minimizing disagreements. (The\nproblems are NP-hard for every k >= 2.) The main technical work is for the\nminimization version, as the PTAS for maximizing agreements follows along the\nlines of the property tester for Max k-CUT.\n  In contrast, when the number of clusters is not specified, the problem of\nminimizing disagreements was shown to be APX-hard, even though the maximization\nversion admits a PTAS.",

    "summary": "Starting with a set of weighted items, we want to create a generic sample of\na certain size that we can later use to estimate the total weight of arbitrary\nsubsets. For this purpose, we propose priority sampling which tested on\nInternet data performed better than previous methods by orders of magnitude.\n  Priority sampling is simple to define and implement: we consider a steam of\nitems i=0,...,n-1 with weights w_i. For each item i, we generate a random\nnumber r_i in (0,1) and create a priority q_i=w_i/r_i. The sample S consists of\nthe k highest priority items. Let t be the (k+1)th highest priority. Each\nsampled item i in S gets a weight estimate W_i=max{w_i,t}, while non-sampled\nitems get weight estimate W_i=0.\n  Magically, it turns out that the weight estimates are unbiased, that is,\nE[W_i]=w_i, and by linearity of expectation, we get unbiased estimators over\nany subset sum simply by adding the sampled weight estimates from the subset.\nAlso, we can estimate the variance of the estimates, and surpricingly, there is\nno co-variance between different weight estimates W_i and W_j.\n  We conjecture an extremely strong near-optimality; namely that for any weight\nsequence, there exists no specialized scheme for sampling k items with unbiased\nestimators that gets smaller total variance than priority sampling with k+1\nitems. Very recently Mario Szegedy has settled this conjecture.",

    "summary": "In this paper we study the problem of finding the approximate nearest\nneighbor of a query point in the high dimensional space, focusing on the\nEuclidean space. The earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions\n(that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash\ntables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest\nneighbor in at least one table. Our approach is different -- we use one (or a\nfew) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of\nthe query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket\ncontaining its nearest neighbor. We show that the number of randomly chosen\npoints in the neighborhood of the query point $q$ required depends on the\nentropy of the hash value $h(p)$ of a random point $p$ at the same distance\nfrom $q$ at its nearest neighbor, given $q$ and the locality preserving hash\nfunction $h$ chosen randomly from the hash family. Precisely, we show that if\nthe entropy $I(h(p)|q,h) = M$ and $g$ is a bound on the probability that two\nfar-off points will hash to the same bucket, then we can find the approximate\nnearest neighbor in $O(n^\\rho)$ time and near linear $\\tilde O(n)$ space where\n$\\rho = M/\\log(1/g)$. Alternatively we can build a data structure of size\n$\\tilde O(n^{1/(1-\\rho)})$ to answer queries in $\\tilde O(d)$ time. By applying\nthis analysis to the locality preserving hash functions in and adjusting the\nparameters we show that the $c$ nearest neighbor can be computed in time\n$\\tilde O(n^\\rho)$ and near linear space where $\\rho \\approx 2.06/c$ as $c$\nbecomes large.",

    "summary": "The competitive analysis fails to model locality of reference in the online\npaging problem. To deal with it, Borodin et. al. introduced the access graph\nmodel, which attempts to capture the locality of reference. However, the access\ngraph model has a number of troubling aspects. The access graph has to be known\nin advance to the paging algorithm and the memory required to represent the\naccess graph itself may be very large.\n  In this paper we present truly online strongly competitive paging algorithms\nin the access graph model that do not have any prior information on the access\nsequence. We present both deterministic and randomized algorithms. The\nalgorithms need only O(k log n) bits of memory, where k is the number of page\nslots available and n is the size of the virtual address space. I.e.,\nasymptotically no more memory than needed to store the virtual address\ntranslation table.\n  We also observe that our algorithms adapt themselves to temporal changes in\nthe locality of reference. We model temporal changes in the locality of\nreference by extending the access graph model to the so called extended access\ngraph model, in which many vertices of the graph can correspond to the same\nvirtual page. We define a measure for the rate of change in the locality of\nreference in G denoted by Delta(G). We then show our algorithms remain strongly\ncompetitive as long as Delta(G) >= (1+ epsilon)k, and no truly online algorithm\ncan be strongly competitive on a class of extended access graphs that includes\nall graphs G with Delta(G) >= k- o(k).",

To cope with that problem, Tapenade implements a\nsub-optimal version of a technique called checkpointing, which is a trade-off\nbetween storage and recomputation. Our long-term goal is to provide an optimal\ncheckpointing strategy for every code, not yet achieved by any AD tool. Towards\nthat goal, we first introduce modifications in Tapenade in order to give the\nuser the choice to select the checkpointing strategy most suitable for their\ncode. Second, we conduct experiments in real-size scientific codes in order to\ngather hints that help us to deduce an optimal checkpointing strategy.

With unit weights, we can compute subset\nsizes which together with the previous sums provide the subset averages. The\nquestion addressed here is which sampling scheme we should use to get the most\naccurate subset sum estimates.\n  We present a simple theorem on the variance of subset sum estimation and use\nit to prove variance optimality and near-optimality of subset sum estimation\nwith different known sampling schemes.

Typical tasks include computing various\nstatistics over a sliding window of some fixed time-horizon. What makes the\nstreaming model interesting is that as the time progresses, old items expire\nand new ones arrive. One of the simplest and central tasks in this model is\nsampling. That is, the task of maintaining up to $k$ uniformly distributed\nitems from a current time-window as old items expire and new ones arrive. We\ncall sampling algorithms {\\bf succinct} if they use provably optimal (up to\nconstant factors) {\\bf worst-case} memory to maintain $k$ items (either with or\nwithout replacement). We stress that in many applications structures that have\n{\\em expected} succinct representation as the time progresses are not\nsufficient, as small probability events eventually happen with probability 1.\nThus, in this paper we ask the following question: are Succinct Sampling on\nStreams (or $S^3$-algorithms)possible, and if so for what models? Perhaps\nsomewhat surprisingly, we show that $S^3$-algorithms are possible for {\\em all}\nvariants of the problem mentioned above, i.e. both with and without replacement\nand both for one-at-a-time and bursty arrival models.

    "summary": "We show that the absolute worst case time complexity for Hopcroft's\nminimization algorithm applied to unary languages is reached only for de Bruijn\nwords. A previous paper by Berstel and Carton gave the example of de Bruijn\nwords as a language that requires O(n log n) steps by carefully choosing the\nsplitting sets and processing these sets in a FIFO mode. We refine the previous\nresult by showing that the Berstel/Carton example is actually the absolute\nworst case time complexity in the case of unary languages. We also show that a\nLIFO implementation will not achieve the same worst time complexity for the\ncase of unary languages. Lastly, we show that the same result is valid also for\nthe cover automata and a modification of the Hopcroft's algorithm, modification\nused in minimization of cover automata.",

    "summary": "Many data analysis applications deal with large matrices and involve\napproximating the matrix using a small number of ``components.'' Typically,\nthese components are linear combinations of the rows and columns of the matrix,\nand are thus difficult to interpret in terms of the original features of the\ninput data. In this paper, we propose and study matrix approximations that are\nexplicitly expressed in terms of a small number of columns and/or rows of the\ndata matrix, and thereby more amenable to interpretation in terms of the\noriginal data. Our main algorithmic results are two randomized algorithms which\ntake as input an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ and a rank parameter $k$. In our first\nalgorithm, $C$ is chosen, and we let $A'=CC^+A$, where $C^+$ is the\nMoore-Penrose generalized inverse of $C$. In our second algorithm $C$, $U$, $R$\nare chosen, and we let $A'=CUR$. ($C$ and $R$ are matrices that consist of\nactual columns and rows, respectively, of $A$, and $U$ is a generalized inverse\nof their intersection.) For each algorithm, we show that with probability at\nleast $1-\\delta$: $$ ||A-A'||_F \\leq (1+\\epsilon) ||A-A_k||_F, $$ where $A_k$\nis the ``best'' rank-$k$ approximation provided by truncating the singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) of $A$. The number of columns of $C$ and rows of $R$\nis a low-degree polynomial in $k$, $1/\\epsilon$, and $\\log(1/\\delta)$. Our two\nalgorithms are the first polynomial time algorithms for such low-rank matrix\napproximations that come with relative-error guarantees; previously, in some\ncases, it was not even known whether such matrix decompositions exist. Both of\nour algorithms are simple, they take time of the order needed to approximately\ncompute the top $k$ singular vectors of $A$, and they use a novel, intuitive\nsampling method called ``subspace sampling.''",

    "summary": "We address the problem of minimizing power consumption when performing\nreliable broadcast on a radio network under the following popular model. Each\nnode in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and\nwhenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the\nmessage. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a\nmessage to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the\nnodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of\ndeleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and\nmoreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models\nworst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply\nsome points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node\nin the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound\nshows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our\nfirst result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a\n1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation. Our algorithm achieves this\nwhile ensuring correctness with probability 1, and keeping optimal values for\nother resource costs such as latency and number of messages sent. We give a\nlower-bound that shows that this reduction in power consumption is\nasymptotically optimal when latency and number of messages sent must be\noptimal. If we can increase the latency and messages sent by only a log*n\nfactor we give a Las Vegas algorithm that requires each node to be awake for\nonly a (log*n)/n expected fraction of the time; we give a lower-bound showing\nthat this second algorithm is near optimal.

The coarsest\nlevel of blocking replaces GCD computations by multiplications, as suggested by\nPollard (1975), von zur Gathen and Shoup (1992), and others. The novelty of our\napproach is that a finer level of blocking replaces multiplications by\nsquarings, which speeds up the computation in GF(2)[x]/P(x) of certain interval\npolynomials when P(x) is sparse. As an application we give a fast algorithm to\nsearch for all irreducible trinomials x^r + x^s + 1 of degree r over GF(2),\nwhile producing a certificate that can be checked in less time than the full\nsearch. Naive algorithms cost O(r^2) per trinomial, thus O(r^3) to search over\nall trinomials of given degree r. Under a plausible assumption about the\ndistribution of factors of trinomials, the new algorithm has complexity O(r^2\n(log r)^{3/2}(log log r)^{1/2}) for the search over all trinomials of degree r.\nOur implementation achieves a speedup of greater than a factor of 560 over the\nnaive algorithm in the case r = 24036583 (a Mersenne exponent).

    "summary": "Motivated by an application in computational topology, we consider a novel\nvariant of the problem of efficiently maintaining dynamic rooted trees. This\nvariant requires merging two paths in a single operation. In contrast to the\nstandard problem, in which only one tree arc changes at a time, a single merge\noperation can change many arcs. In spite of this, we develop a data structure\nthat supports merges on an n-node forest in O(log^2 n) amortized time and all\nother standard tree operations in O(log n) time (amortized, worst-case, or\nrandomized depending on the underlying data structure). For the special case\nthat occurs in the motivating application, in which arbitrary arc deletions\n(cuts) are not allowed, we give a data structure with an O(log n) time bound\nper operation. This is asymptotically optimal under certain assumptions. For\nthe even-more special case in which both cuts and parent queries are\ndisallowed, we give an alternative O(log n)-time solution that uses standard\ndynamic trees as a black box. This solution also applies to the motivating\napplication. Our methods use previous work on dynamic trees in various ways,\nbut the analysis of each algorithm requires novel ideas.

In\nits ultimate generality, the restless bandit problem is known to be PSPACE-Hard\nto approximate to any non-trivial factor, and little progress has been made\ndespite its importance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty.\n  We consider a special case that we call Feedback MAB, where the reward\nobtained by playing each of n independent arms varies according to an\nunderlying on/off Markov process whose exact state is only revealed when the\narm is played. The goal is to design a policy for playing the arms in order to\nmaximize the infinite horizon time average expected reward. This problem is\nalso an instance of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and\nis widely studied in wireless scheduling and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)\nrouting. Unlike the stochastic MAB problem, the Feedback MAB problem does not\nadmit to greedy index-based optimal policies.\n  We develop a novel and general duality-based algorithmic technique that\nyields a surprisingly simple and intuitive 2+epsilon-approximate greedy policy\nto this problem. We then define a general sub-class of restless bandit problems\nthat we term Monotone bandits, for which our policy is a 2-approximation. Our\ntechnique is robust enough to handle generalizations of these problems to\nincorporate various side-constraints such as blocking plays and switching\ncosts. This technique is also of independent interest for other restless bandit\nproblems.

The general\nscenario can be described as follows. The microprocessor's temperature is\ncontrolled by the hardware thermal management system that continuously monitors\nthe chip temperature and automatically reduces the processor's speed as soon as\nthe thermal threshold is exceeded. Some tasks are more CPU-intensive than other\nand thus generate more heat during execution. The cooling system operates\nnon-stop, reducing (at an exponential rate) the deviation of the processor's\ntemperature from the ambient temperature. As a result, the processor's\ntemperature, and thus the performance as well, depends on the order of the task\nexecution. Given a variety of possible underlying architectures, models for\ncooling and for hardware thermal management, as well as types of tasks, this\nscenario gives rise to a plethora of interesting and never studied scheduling\nproblems.\n  We focus on scheduling real-time jobs in a simplified model for cooling and\nthermal management. A collection of unit-length jobs is given, each job\nspecified by its release time, deadline and heat contribution. If, at some time\nstep, the temperature of the system is t and the processor executes a job with\nheat contribution h, then the temperature at the next step is (t+h)/2. The\ntemperature cannot exceed the given thermal threshold T. The objective is to\nmaximize the throughput, that is, the number of tasks that meet their\ndeadlines.

    "summary": "Covering problems are fundamental classical problems in optimization,\ncomputer science and complexity theory. Typically an input to these problems is\na family of sets over a finite universe and the goal is to cover the elements\nof the universe with as few sets of the family as possible.\n  The variations of covering problems include well known problems like Set\nCover, Vertex Cover, Dominating Set and Facility Location to name a few.\nRecently there has been a lot of study on partial covering problems, a natural\ngeneralization of covering problems. Here, the goal is not to cover all the\nelements but to cover the specified number of elements with the minimum number\nof sets.\n  In this paper we study partial covering problems in graphs in the realm of\nparameterized complexity. Classical (non-partial) version of all these problems\nhave been intensively studied in planar graphs and in graphs excluding a fixed\ngraph $H$ as a minor. However, the techniques developed for parameterized\nversion of non-partial covering problems cannot be applied directly to their\npartial counterparts. The approach we use, to show that various partial\ncovering problems are fixed parameter tractable on planar graphs, graphs of\nbounded local treewidth and graph excluding some graph as a minor, is quite\ndifferent from previously known techniques. The main idea behind our approach\nis the concept of implicit branching.

Given a ground set V and a collection of subsets\nS_i of V, a feasible solution is a partition of V such that each subset of the\npartition is included in one of the S_i. The problem involves maximizing the\nmean subset size of the partition, where the mean is the generalized mean of\nparameter p, taken over the elements. For p=-1, the problem is equivalent to\nthe classical minimum set cover problem. For p=0, it is equivalent to the\nminimum entropy set cover problem, introduced by Halperin and Karp. For p=1,\nthe problem includes the maximum-edge clique partition problem as a special\ncase. We prove that the greedy algorithm simultaneously approximates the\nproblem within a factor of (p+1)^1/p for any p in R^+, and that this is the\nbest possible unless P=NP. These results both generalize and simplify previous\nresults for special cases. We also consider the corresponding graph coloring\nproblem, and prove several tractability and inapproximability results. Finally,\nwe consider a further generalization of the set cover problem in which we aim\nat minimizing the sum of some concave function of the part sizes.

The larger the price, the smaller the rent. The actual usage\ntime is determined by an adversary, and the goal of an algorithm is to minimize\nthe cost by choosing the best option at any point in time. Multislope Ski\nRental is a natural generalization of the classical Ski Rental problem (where\nthe only options are pure rent and pure buy), which is one of the fundamental\nproblems of online computation. The Multislope Ski Rental problem is an\nabstraction of many problems where online decisions cannot be modeled by just\ntwo options, e.g., power management in systems which can be shut down in parts.\nIn this paper we study randomized algorithms for Multislope Ski Rental. Our\nresults include the best possible online randomized strategy for any additive\ninstance, where the cost of switching from one option to another is the\ndifference in their buying prices; and an algorithm that produces an\n$e$-competitive randomized strategy for any (non-additive) instance.",

Previously proposed dynamical processes enabled to demonstrate\nexperimentally (by simulations) that the small world phenomenon can emerge from\nlocal dynamics. However, the analysis of greedy routing using the probability\ndistributions arising from these dynamics is quite complex because of mutual\ndependencies. In contrast, our process enables complete formal analysis. It is\nbased on the combination of two simple processes: a random walk process, and an\nharmonic forgetting process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the\nindividuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances.\nWe prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two\nprocesses generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a\nk-harmonic distribution.

We show an $O(\\log^2 (mc))$-competitive\nrandomized algorithm for the weighted case, where $m$ is the number of edges in\nthe graph and $c$ is the maximum edge capacity. For the unweighted case, we\ngive an $O(\\log m \\log c)$-competitive randomized algorithm. This settles an\nopen question of Blum, Kalai and Kleinberg raised in \\cite{BlKaKl01}.

    "summary": "We study the minimum backlog problem (MBP). This online problem arises, e.g.,\nin the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.\n  The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The player\nis initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary\npours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices\nof the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player\nthen moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at\nthat vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the\nmaximum amount of water in any cup at any time.\n  The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are\npoints in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at\na constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the\nplayer's objective is to minimize the backlog.\n  We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower\nbound of $\\Omega(D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete\nMBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we\nfocus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper\nbound on the absolute value of the backlog.\n  For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of\n$\\Omega(D)$, and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an\nupper bound of $O(D\\log N)$ for $N$ cups. Our main result is a tight upper\nbound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player\nthat guarantees a backlog of $O(D)$, independently of the number of cups.",

    "summary": "In their seminal work, Alon, Matias, and Szegedy introduced several sketching\ntechniques, including showing that 4-wise independence is sufficient to obtain\ngood approximations of the second frequency moment. In this work, we show that\ntheir sketching technique can be extended to product domains $[n]^k$ by using\nthe product of 4-wise independent functions on $[n]$. Our work extends that of\nIndyk and McGregor, who showed the result for $k = 2$. Their primary motivation\nwas the problem of identifying correlations in data streams. In their model, a\nstream of pairs $(i,j) \\in [n]^2$ arrive, giving a joint distribution $(X,Y)$,\nand they find approximation algorithms for how close the joint distribution is\nto the product of the marginal distributions under various metrics, which\nnaturally corresponds to how close $X$ and $Y$ are to being independent. By\nusing our technique, we obtain a new result for the problem of approximating\nthe $\\ell_2$ distance between the joint distribution and the product of the\nmarginal distributions for $k$-ary vectors, instead of just pairs, in a single\npass. Our analysis gives a randomized algorithm that is a $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$\napproximation (with probability $1-\\delta$) that requires space logarithmic in\n$n$ and $m$ and proportional to $3^k$.",

    "summary": "We examine several online matching problems, with applications to Internet\nadvertising reservation systems. Consider an edge-weighted bipartite graph G,\nwith partite sets L, R. We develop an 8-competitive algorithm for the following\nsecretary problem: Initially given R, and the size of L, the algorithm receives\nthe vertices of L sequentially, in a random order. When a vertex l \\in L is\nseen, all edges incident to l are revealed, together with their weights. The\nalgorithm must immediately either match l to an available vertex of R, or\ndecide that l will remain unmatched.\n  Dimitrov and Plaxton show a 16-competitive algorithm for the transversal\nmatroid secretary problem, which is the special case with weights on vertices,\nnot edges. (Equivalently, one may assume that for each l \\in L, the weights on\nall edges incident to l are identical.) We use a similar algorithm, but\nsimplify and improve the analysis to obtain a better competitive ratio for the\nmore general problem. Perhaps of more interest is the fact that our analysis is\neasily extended to obtain competitive algorithms for similar problems, such as\nto find disjoint sets of edges in hypergraphs where edges arrive online. We\nalso introduce secretary problems with adversarially chosen groups. Finally, we\ngive a 2e-competitive algorithm for the secretary problem on graphic matroids,\nwhere, with edges appearing online, the goal is to find a maximum-weight\nacyclic subgraph of a given graph.",

    "summary": "Recent work has addressed the algorithmic problem of allocating advertisement\nspace for keywords in sponsored search auctions so as to maximize revenue, most\nof which assume that pricing is done via a first-price auction. This does not\nrealistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in\npractice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they are\nallocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, we\nintroduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are\ndetermined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of the\nSecond-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the more\nstudied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant,\nfor which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard to\napproximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor,\neven when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancy\nextends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching\nproblem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no\ndeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no\nrandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This\ncontrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-price\nmodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial\ntime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving\nbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation\nfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.\nThe latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on the\nperformance of the \"Ranking\" algorithm for online bipartite matching.",

The local-search algorithm for $k$-median was analyzed\nby Arya et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 33(3):544-562, 2004), who used a clever\n``coupling'' argument to show that local optima had cost at most constant times\nthe global optimum.

    "summary": "In the budgeted learning problem, we are allowed to experiment on a set of\nalternatives (given a fixed experimentation budget) with the goal of picking a\nsingle alternative with the largest possible expected payoff. Approximation\nalgorithms for this problem were developed by Guha and Munagala by rounding a\nlinear program that couples the various alternatives together. In this paper we\npresent an index for this problem, which we call the ratio index, which also\nguarantees a constant factor approximation. Index-based policies have the\nadvantage that a single number (i.e. the index) can be computed for each\nalternative irrespective of all other alternatives, and the alternative with\nthe highest index is experimented upon. This is analogous to the famous Gittins\nindex for the discounted multi-armed bandit problem.\n  The ratio index has several interesting structural properties. First, we show\nthat it can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Second, we show that with\nthe appropriate discount factor, the Gittins index and our ratio index are\nconstant factor approximations of each other, and hence the Gittins index also\ngives a constant factor approximation to the budgeted learning problem.\nFinally, we show that the ratio index can be used to create an index-based\npolicy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for the finite horizon version of\nthe multi-armed bandit problem. Moreover, the policy does not require any\nknowledge of the horizon (whereas we compare its performance against an optimal\nstrategy that is aware of the horizon). This yields the following surprising\nresult: there is an index-based policy that achieves an O(1)-approximation for\nthe multi-armed bandit problem, oblivious to the underlying discount factor.",

The load on an edge\nis defined to be the number of cuts in the solution crossing the edge.

Multiway cut\npacking arises in the context of graph labeling problems where we are given a\npartial labeling of a set of items and a neighborhood structure over them, and,\ninformally, the goal is to complete the labeling in the most consistent way.\nThis problem was introduced by Rabani, Schulman, and Swamy (SODA'08), who\ndeveloped an O(log n/log log n) approximation for it in general graphs, as well\nas an improved O(log^2 k) approximation in trees.

    "summary": "Hash tables are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer\nscience, in both theory and practice. They are especially useful in external\nmemory, where their query performance approaches the ideal cost of just one\ndisk access. Knuth gave an elegant analysis showing that with some simple\ncollision resolution strategies such as linear probing or chaining, the\nexpected average number of disk I/Os of a lookup is merely $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$,\nwhere each I/O can read a disk block containing $b$ items. Inserting a new item\ninto the hash table also costs $1+1/2^{\\Omega(b)}$ I/Os, which is again almost\nthe best one can do if the hash table is entirely stored on disk. However, this\nassumption is unrealistic since any algorithm operating on an external hash\ntable must have some internal memory (at least $\\Omega(1)$ blocks) to work\nwith. The availability of a small internal memory buffer can dramatically\nreduce the amortized insertion cost to $o(1)$ I/Os for many external memory\ndata structures. In this paper we study the inherent query-insertion tradeoff\nof external hash tables in the presence of a memory buffer. In particular, we\nshow that for any constant $c>1$, if the query cost is targeted at\n$1+O(1/b^{c})$ I/Os, then it is not possible to support insertions in less than\n$1-O(1/b^{\\frac{c-1}{4}})$ I/Os amortized, which means that the memory buffer\nis essentially useless. While if the query cost is relaxed to $1+O(1/b^{c})$\nI/Os for any constant $c<1$, there is a simple dynamic hash table with $o(1)$\ninsertion cost.

In comparison, the best\nprevious local partitioning algorithm, due to Andersen, Chung, and Lang, has\nthe same approximation guarantee, but a larger ratio of $O(\\phi^{-1}\npolylog(n))$ between the complexity and output volume. Using our local\npartitioning algorithm as a subroutine, we construct a fast algorithm for\nfinding balanced cuts. Given a fixed value of $\\phi$, the resulting algorithm\nhas complexity $O((m+n\\phi^{-1/2}) polylog(n))$ and returns a cut with\nconductance $O(\\phi^{1/2} \\log^{1/2} n)$ and volume at least $v_{\\phi}/2$,\nwhere $v_{\\phi}$ is the largest volume of any set with conductance at most\n$\\phi$.",

    "summary": "Within a mathematically rigorous model, we analyse the curse of\ndimensionality for deterministic exact similarity search in the context of\npopular indexing schemes: metric trees. The datasets $X$ are sampled randomly\nfrom a domain $\\Omega$, equipped with a distance, $\\rho$, and an underlying\nprobability distribution, $\\mu$. While performing an asymptotic analysis, we\nsend the intrinsic dimension $d$ of $\\Omega$ to infinity, and assume that the\nsize of a dataset, $n$, grows superpolynomially yet subexponentially in $d$.\nExact similarity search refers to finding the nearest neighbour in the dataset\n$X$ to a query point $\\omega\\in\\Omega$, where the query points are subject to\nthe same probability distribution $\\mu$ as datapoints. Let $\\mathscr F$ denote\na class of all 1-Lipschitz functions on $\\Omega$ that can be used as decision\nfunctions in constructing a hierarchical metric tree indexing scheme. Suppose\nthe VC dimension of the class of all sets $\\{\\omega\\colon f(\\omega)\\geq a\\}$,\n$a\\in\\R$ is $o(n^{1/4}/\\log^2n)$.

For a given $0 \\le \\phi \\le\n1$, the $\\phi$-heavy hitters are those elements of $A$ whose frequency in $A$\nis at least $\\phi |A|$; the $\\phi$-quantile of $A$ is an element $x$ of $U$\nsuch that at most $\\phi|A|$ elements of $A$ are smaller than $A$ and at most\n$(1-\\phi)|A|$ elements of $A$ are greater than $x$.

The performance of such a system (as captured by some\nobjective function over the parameters) is significantly improved if some of\nthese parameters can be probed or observed. In a resource constrained\nsituation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system\nperformance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem.\nThis general problem is the focus of this paper.\n  One of the most important considerations in this framework is whether\nadaptivity is required for the observations. Adaptive observations introduce\nblocking or sequential operations in the system whereas non-adaptive\nobservations can be performed in parallel. One of the important questions in\nthis regard is to characterize the benefit of adaptivity for probes and\nobservation.\n  We present general techniques for designing constant factor approximations to\nthe optimal observation schemes for several widely used scheduling and metric\nobjective functions. We show a unifying technique that relates this\noptimization problem to the outlier version of the corresponding deterministic\noptimization. By making this connection, our technique shows constant factor\nupper bounds for the benefit of adaptivity of the observation schemes. We show\nthat while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function,\nbeing adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors.",

In the first\n(randomized) stage, the algorithm randomly selects $\\Theta(k \\log k)$ columns\naccording to a judiciously-chosen probability distribution that depends on\ninformation in the top-$k$ right singular subspace of $A$.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in\nanalysing distributions in a streaming setting, but the progress on graph\nproblems has been limited. A main reason for this has been the existence of\nlinear space lower bounds for even simple problems such as determining the\nconnectedness of a graph. However, in many new scenarios that arise from social\nand other interaction networks, the number of vertices is significantly less\nthan the number of edges. This has led to the formulation of the semi-streaming\nmodel where we assume that the space is (near) linear in the number of vertices\n(but not necessarily the edges), and the edges appear in an arbitrary (and\npossibly adversarial) order.\n  In this paper we focus on graph sparsification, which is one of the major\nbuilding blocks in a variety of graph algorithms. There has been a long history\nof (non-streaming) sampling algorithms that provide sparse graph approximations\nand it a natural question to ask if the sparsification can be achieved using a\nsmall space, and in addition using a single pass over the data? The question is\ninteresting from the standpoint of both theory and practice and we answer the\nquestion in the affirmative, by providing a one pass\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^{2})$ space algorithm that produces a sparsification that\napproximates each cut to a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor. We also show that $\\Omega(n\n\\log \\frac1\\epsilon)$ space is necessary for a one pass streaming algorithm to\napproximate the min-cut, improving upon the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound that arises\nfrom lower bounds for testing connectivity.",

    "summary": "We consider a robust model proposed by Scarf, 1958, for stochastic\noptimization when only the marginal probabilities of (binary) random variables\nare given, and the correlation between the random variables is unknown. In the\nrobust model, the objective is to minimize expected cost against worst possible\njoint distribution with those marginals. We introduce the concept of\ncorrelation gap to compare this model to the stochastic optimization model that\nignores correlations and minimizes expected cost under independent Bernoulli\ndistribution. We identify a class of functions, using concepts of summable cost\nsharing schemes from game theory, for which the correlation gap is well-bounded\nand the robust model can be approximated closely by the independent\ndistribution model. As a result, we derive efficient approximation factors for\nmany popular cost functions, like submodular functions, facility location, and\nSteiner tree. As a byproduct, our analysis also yields some new results in the\nareas of social welfare maximization and existence of Walrasian equilibria,\nwhich may be of independent interest.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of representing, in a compressed format, a bit-vector\n$S$ of $m$ bits with $n$ 1s, supporting the following operations, where $b \\in\n\\{0, 1 \\}$: $rank_b(S,i)$ returns the number of occurrences of bit $b$ in the\nprefix $S[1..i]$; $select_b(S,i)$ returns the position of the $i$th occurrence\nof bit $b$ in $S$. Such a data structure is called \\emph{fully indexable\ndictionary (FID)} [Raman et al.,2007], and is at least as powerful as\npredecessor data structures. Our focus is on space-efficient FIDs on the\n\\textsc{ram} model with word size $\\Theta(\\lg m)$ and constant time for all\noperations, so that the time cost is independent of the input size. Given the\nbitstring $S$ to be encoded, having length $m$ and containing $n$ ones, the\nminimal amount of information that needs to be stored is $B(n,m) = \\lceil \\log\n{{m}\\choose{n}} \\rceil$. The state of the art in building a FID for $S$ is\ngiven in [Patrascu,2008] using $B(m,n)+O(m / ((\\log m/ t) ^t)) + O(m^{3/4}) $\nbits, to support the operations in $O(t)$ time. Here, we propose a parametric\ndata structure exhibiting a time/space trade-off such that, for any real\nconstants $0 < \\delta \\leq 1/2$, $0 < \\eps \\leq 1$, and integer $s > 0$, it\nuses \\[ B(n,m) + O(n^{1+\\delta} + n (\\frac{m}{n^s})^\\eps) \\] bits and performs\nall the operations in time $O(s\\delta^{-1} + \\eps^{-1})$. The improvement is\ntwofold: our redundancy can be lowered parametrically and, fixing $s = O(1)$,\nwe get a constant-time FID whose space is $B(n,m) + O(m^\\eps/\\poly{n})$ bits,\nfor sufficiently large $m$. This is a significant improvement compared to the\nprevious bounds for the general case.",

Element-connectivity is more\ngeneral than edge-connectivity and less general than vertex-connectivity. Hind\nand Oellermann gave a graph reduction step that preserves the global\nelement-connectivity of the graph. We show that this step also preserves local\nconnectivity, that is, all the pairwise element-connectivities of the\nterminals. We give two applications of this reduction step to connectivity and\nnetwork design problems:\n  1. Given a graph G and disjoint terminal sets T_1, T_2, ..., T_m, we seek a\nmaximum number of element-disjoint Steiner forests where each forest connects\neach T_i. We prove that if each T_i is k-element-connected then there exist\n\\Omega(\\frac{k}{\\log h \\log m}) element-disjoint Steiner forests, where h =\n|\\bigcup_i T_i|. If G is planar (or more generally, has fixed genus), we show\nthat there exist \\Omega(k) Steiner forests.

However, with a noticeable probability\nduring the insertion of n elements some insertion requires \\Omega(log n) time.\nWhereas such an amortized guarantee may be suitable for some applications, in\nother applications (such as high-performance routing) this is highly\nundesirable.\n  Recently, Kirsch and Mitzenmacher (Allerton '07) proposed a de-amortization\nof cuckoo hashing using various queueing techniques that preserve its\nattractive properties. Kirsch and Mitzenmacher demonstrated a significant\nimprovement to the worst case performance of cuckoo hashing via experimental\nresults, but they left open the problem of constructing a scheme with provable\nproperties.\n  In this work we follow Kirsch and Mitzenmacher and present a de-amortization\nof cuckoo hashing that provably guarantees constant worst case operations.\nSpecifically, for any sequence of polynomially many operations, with\noverwhelming probability over the randomness of the initialization phase, each\noperation is performed in constant time. Our theoretical analysis and\nexperimental results indicate that the scheme is highly efficient, and provides\na practical alternative to the only other known dynamic dictionary with such\nworst case guarantees, due to Dietzfelbinger and Meyer auf der Heide (ICALP\n'90).",

    "summary": "Much research has been devoted to optimizing algorithms of the Lempel-Ziv\n(LZ) 77 family, both in terms of speed and memory requirements. Binary search\ntrees and suffix trees (ST) are data structures that have been often used for\nthis purpose, as they allow fast searches at the expense of memory usage.\n  In recent years, there has been interest on suffix arrays (SA), due to their\nsimplicity and low memory requirements. One key issue is that an SA can solve\nthe sub-string problem almost as efficiently as an ST, using less memory. This\npaper proposes two new SA-based algorithms for LZ encoding, which require no\nmodifications on the decoder side. Experimental results on standard benchmarks\nshow that our algorithms, though not faster, use 3 to 5 times less memory than\nthe ST counterparts. Another important feature of our SA-based algorithms is\nthat the amount of memory is independent of the text to search, thus the memory\nthat has to be allocated can be defined a priori. These features of low and\npredictable memory requirements are of the utmost importance in several\nscenarios, such as embedded systems, where memory is at a premium and speed is\nnot critical. Finally, we point out that the new algorithms are general, in the\nsense that they are adequate for applications other than LZ compression, such\nas text retrieval and forward/backward sub-string search.",

Our\nresults include: 1. We provide a characterization under which a planar\nst-digraph G is hamiltonian. 2. For an outerplanar st-digraph G, we define the\nst-polygon decomposition of G and, based on its properties, we develop a\nlinear-time algorithm that solves the Acyclic-HPCCM problem. 3. For the class\nof planar st-digraphs, we establish an equivalence between the Acyclic-HPCCM\nproblem and the problem of determining an upward 2-page topological book\nembedding with minimum number of spine crossings. We infer (based on this\nequivalence) for the class of outerplanar st-digraphs an upward topological\n2-page book embedding with minimum number of spine crossings.

Robert Morris [Communications of the ACM, 21:840--842,\n1978] proposed a probabilistic technique for approximate counting that is\nextremely space-efficient. The basic idea is to increment a counter containing\nthe value $X$ with probability $2^{-X}$. As a result, the counter contains an\napproximation of $\\lg n$ after $n$ probabilistic updates stored in $\\lg\\lg n$\nbits. Here we revisit the original idea of Morris, and introduce a binary\nfloating-point counter that uses a $d$-bit significand in conjunction with a\nbinary exponent. The counter yields a simple formula for an unbiased estimation\nof $n$ with a standard deviation of about $0.6\\cdot n2^{-d/2}$, and uses\n$d+\\lg\\lg n$ bits.\n  We analyze the floating-point counter's performance in a general framework\nthat applies to any probabilistic counter, and derive practical formulas to\nassess its accuracy.",

It is known that any $n$-node static tree can be\nrepresented in $2n + o(n)$ bits and a number of operations on the tree can be\nsupported in constant time under the word-RAM model. However the data\nstructures are complicated and difficult to dynamize. We propose a simple and\nflexible data structure, called the range min-max tree, that reduces the large\nnumber of relevant tree operations considered in the literature to a few\nprimitives that are carried out in constant time on sufficiently small trees.\nThe result is extended to trees of arbitrary size, achieving $2n + O(n\n/\\polylog(n))$ bits of space. The redundancy is significantly lower than any\nprevious proposal. Our data structure builds on the range min-max tree to\nachieve $2n+O(n/\\log n)$ bits of space and $O(\\log n)$ time for all the\noperations. We also propose an improved data structure using $2n+O(n\\log\\log\nn/\\log n)$ bits and improving the time to the optimal $O(\\log n/\\log \\log n)$\nfor most operations.

In this paper, we extend this frontier in two\nways: first, we characterize convexity-like conditions that imply good\nisoperimetry, i.e., what condition on function values along every line\nguarantees good isoperimetry? The answer turns out to be the set of\n(1/(n-1))-harmonic concave functions in R^n; we also prove that this is the\nbest possible characterization along every line, of functions having good\nisoperimetry. Next, we give the first efficient algorithm for sampling\naccording to such functions with complexity depending on a smoothness\nparameter.

    "summary": "We consider two well-known natural variants of bin packing, and show that\nthese packing problems admit asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation\nschemes (AFPTAS). In bin packing problems, a set of one-dimensional items of\nsize at most 1 is to be assigned (packed) to subsets of sum at most 1 (bins).\nIt has been known for a while that the most basic problem admits an AFPTAS. In\nthis paper, we develop methods that allow to extend this result to other\nvariants of bin packing. Specifically, the problems which we study in this\npaper, for which we design asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation\nschemes, are the following. The first problem is \"Bin packing with cardinality\nconstraints\", where a parameter k is given, such that a bin may contain up to k\nitems. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. The second problem is\n\"Bin packing with rejection\", where every item has a rejection penalty\nassociated with it. An item needs to be either packed to a bin or rejected, and\nthe goal is to minimize the number of used bins plus the total rejection\npenalty of unpacked items. This resolves the complexity of two important\nvariants of the bin packing problem. Our approximation schemes use a novel\nmethod for packing the small items. This new method is the core of the improved\nrunning times of our schemes over the running times of the previous results,\nwhich are only asymptotic polynomial time approximation schemes (APTAS).",

In the classic bin packing problem, a set of one-dimensional items is\nto be assigned to subsets of total size at most 1, that is, to be packed into\nunit sized bins. However, in GCBP, the cost of a bin is not 1 as in classic bin\npacking, but it is a non-decreasing and concave function of the number of items\npacked in it, where the cost of an empty bin is zero. The construction of the\nAFPTAS requires novel techniques for dealing with small items, which are\ndeveloped in this work. In addition, we develop a fast approximation algorithm\nwhich acts identically for all non-decreasing and concave functions, and has an\nasymptotic approximation ratio of 1.5 for all functions simultaneously.",

Given a set V of n nodes in an underlying asymmetric metric\nand two specified nodes s and t, both problems ask to find an s-t path visiting\nall other nodes. In the asymmetric traveling salesman path problem (ATSPP), the\nobjective is to minimize the total cost of this path. In the directed latency\nproblem, the objective is to minimize the sum of distances on this path from s\nto each node. Both of these problems are NP-hard. The best known approximation\nalgorithms for ATSPP had ratio O(log n) until the very recent result that\nimproves it to O(log n/ log log n). However, only a bound of O(sqrt(n)) for the\nintegrality gap of its linear programming relaxation has been known. For\ndirected latency, the best previously known approximation algorithm has a\nguarantee of O(n^(1/2+eps)), for any constant eps > 0.

    "summary": "Todays ride sharing services still mimic a better billboard. They list the\noffers and allow to search for the source and target city, sometimes enriched\nwith radial search. So finding a connection between big cities is quite easy.\nThese places are on a list of designated origin and distination points. But\nwhen you want to go from a small town to another small town, even when they are\nnext to a freeway, you run into problems. You can't find offers that would or\ncould pass by the town easily with little or no detour. We solve this\ninteresting problem by presenting a fast algorithm that computes the offers\nwith the smallest detours w.r.t. a request. Our experiments show that the\nproblem is efficiently solvable in times suitable for a web service\nimplementation. For realistic database size we achieve lookup times of about\n5ms and a matching rate of 90% instead of just 70% for the simple matching\nalgorithms used today.",

It is often used in combination with the probabilistic method for\nnon-constructive existence proofs. A prominent application is to k-CNF\nformulas, where LLL implies that, if every clause in the formula shares\nvariables with at most d <= 2^k/e other clauses then such a formula has a\nsatisfying assignment. Recently, a randomized algorithm to efficiently\nconstruct a satisfying assignment was given by Moser. Subsequently Moser and\nTardos gave a randomized algorithm to construct the structures guaranteed by\nthe LLL in a very general algorithmic framework. We address the main problem\nleft open by Moser and Tardos of derandomizing these algorithms efficiently.\nSpecifically, for a k-CNF formula with m clauses and d <= 2^{k/(1+\\eps)}/e for\nsome \\eps\\in (0,1), we give an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment in\ntime \\tilde{O}(m^{2(1+1/\\eps)}).

    "summary": "Most recent papers addressing the algorithmic problem of allocating\nadvertisement space for keywords in sponsored search auctions assume that\npricing is done via a first-price auction, which does not realistically model\nthe Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in practice. Towards the goal\nof more realistically modeling these auctions, we introduce the Second-Price Ad\nAuctions problem, in which bidders' payments are determined by the GSP\nmechanism. We show that the complexity of the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem\nis quite different than that of the more studied First-Price Ad Auctions\nproblem. First, unlike the first-price variant, for which small constant-factor\napproximations are known, it is NP-hard to approximate the Second-Price Ad\nAuctions problem to any non-trivial factor. Second, this discrepancy extends\neven to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching problem\n(2PM). In particular, offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no\ndeterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no\nrandomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This stands\nin contrast to the results for the analogous special case in the first-price\nmodel, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial\ntime and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving\nbetter competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation\nfor offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM.\nThe latter result makes use of a new generalization of a classic result on the\nperformance of the \"Ranking\" algorithm for online bipartite matching.",

    "summary": "Perhaps the two most significant theoretical questions about the programming\nof self-assembling agents are: (1) necessary and sufficient conditions to\nproduce a unique terminal assembly, and (2) error correction. We address both\nquestions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of\ndistributed shared memory (DSM), in order to obtain results from the memory\nconsistency systems induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM\nsetting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM\nsystem that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile\nassembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free\nprograms that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of\nthe failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem)\nreduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the\nKinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a\nmemory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge,\nthis is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no\nstronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation\nthat self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast\nconversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic\nself-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an \"immediate\" generalization of a\ntheorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that\nsimultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and\nself-healing. Our reductions and proof techniques can be extended to the\nprogramming of self-assembling agents in a variety of media, not just DNA\ntiles, and not just two-dimensional surfaces.",

    "summary": "The lower and the upper irredundance numbers of a graph $G$, denoted $ir(G)$\nand $IR(G)$ respectively, are conceptually linked to domination and\nindependence numbers and have numerous relations to other graph parameters. It\nis a long-standing open question whether determining these numbers for a graph\n$G$ on $n$ vertices admits exact algorithms running in time less than the\ntrivial $\\Omega(2^n)$ enumeration barrier. We solve these open problems by\ndevising parameterized algorithms for the dual of the natural parameterizations\nof the problems with running times faster than $O^*(4^{k})$. For example, we\npresent an algorithm running in time $O^*(3.069^{k})$ for determining whether\n$IR(G)$ is at least $n-k$. Although the corresponding problem has been known to\nbe in FPT by kernelization techniques, this paper offers the first\nparameterized algorithms with an exponential dependency on the parameter in the\nrunning time. Additionally, our work also appears to be the first example of a\nparameterized approach leading to a solution to a problem in exponential time\nalgorithmics where the natural interpretation as an exact exponential-time\nalgorithm fails.",

The crux of the process is a clustering procedure called\nprize-collecting clustering that breaks down the input instance into separate\nsubinstances which are easier to handle; moreover, the terminals in different\nsubinstances are far from each other. Each subinstance has a relatively\ninexpensive Steiner tree connecting all its terminals, and the subinstances can\nbe solved (almost) separately.

A hash table can be constructed successfully if each key can be placed\ninto one of its buckets.

In this paper, we introduce a\nlocally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its\nusefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised\nmanner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a\nconstrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as\nan additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new\nproblem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a\nPersonalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the\nsolution can be computed in nearly-linear time.

Second, a\ndemand-supply plan considered here is static, in contrast to a dynamic policy\nconsidered in previous works. Moreover, in order to efficiently develop a\nlong-term static plan, a severe loss (a risk) is taken into account, i.e. a\nrisk occurs if the real amount of water stored in each reservoir in each time\nperiod is less than what planned by the optimizer. The multi-connection\nfunction and the risk make the problem rather complex such that traditional\nstochastic dynamic programming and deterministic/heuristic approaches are\ninappropriate.

    "summary": "The performance of a dynamic dictionary is measured mainly by its update\ntime, lookup time, and space consumption. In terms of update time and lookup\ntime there are known constructions that guarantee constant-time operations in\nthe worst case with high probability, and in terms of space consumption there\nare known constructions that use essentially optimal space. However, although\nthe first analysis of a dynamic dictionary dates back more than 45 years ago\n(when Knuth analyzed linear probing in 1963), the trade-off between these\naspects of performance is still not completely understood. In this paper we\nsettle two fundamental open problems: - We construct the first dynamic\ndictionary that enjoys the best of both worlds: it stores n elements using\n(1+epsilon)n memory words, and guarantees constant-time operations in the worst\ncase with high probability. Specifically, for any epsilon = \\Omega((\\log\\log n\n/ \\log n)^{1/2} ) and for any sequence of polynomially many operations, with\nhigh probability over the randomness of the initialization phase, all\noperations are performed in constant time which is independent of epsilon. The\nconstruction is a two-level variant of cuckoo hashing, augmented with a\n\"backyard\" that handles a large fraction of the elements, together with a\nde-amortized perfect hashing scheme for eliminating the dependency on epsilon.\n- We present a variant of the above construction that uses only (1+o(1))B bits,\nwhere B is the information-theoretic lower bound for representing a set of size\nn taken from a universe of size u, and guarantees constant-time operations in\nthe worst case with high probability, as before. This problem was open even in\nthe amortized setting. One of the main ingredients of our construction is a\npermutation-based variant of cuckoo hashing, which significantly improves the\nspace consumption of cuckoo hashing when dealing with a rather small universe.",

    "summary": "A mobile robot represented by a point moving in the plane has to explore an\nunknown terrain with obstacles. Both the terrain and the obstacles are modeled\nas arbitrary polygons. We consider two scenarios: the unlimited vision, when\nthe robot situated at a point p of the terrain explores (sees) all points q of\nthe terrain for which the segment pq belongs to the terrain, and the limited\nvision, when we require additionally that the distance between p and q be at\nmost 1. All points of the terrain (except obstacles) have to be explored and\nthe performance of an exploration algorithm is measured by the length of the\ntrajectory of the robot. For unlimited vision we show an exploration algorithm\nwith complexity O(P + D?k), where P is the total perimeter of the terrain\n(including perimeters of obstacles), D is the diameter of the convex hull of\nthe terrain, and k is the number of obstacles. We do not assume knowledge of\nthese parameters. We also prove a matching lower bound showing that the above\ncomplexity is optimal, even if the terrain is known to the robot. For limited\nvision we show exploration algorithms with complexity O(P + A + ?Ak), where A\nis the area of the terrain (excluding obstacles). Our algorithms work either\nfor arbitrary terrains, if one of the parameters A or k is known, or for c-fat\nterrains, where c is any constant (unknown to the robot) and no additional\nknowledge is assumed. (A terrain T with obstacles is c-fat if R/r ? c, where R\nis the radius of the smallest disc containing T and r is the radius of the\nlargest disc contained in T .) We also prove a matching lower bound ?(P + A +\n?Ak) on the complexity of exploration for limited vision, even if the terrain\nis known to the robot.",

    "summary": "Grammar based compression, where one replaces a long string by a small\ncontext-free grammar that generates the string, is a simple and powerful\nparadigm that captures many popular compression schemes. In this paper, we\npresent a novel grammar representation that allows efficient random access to\nany character or substring without decompressing the string.\n  Let $S$ be a string of length $N$ compressed into a context-free grammar\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of size $n$. We present two representations of $\\mathcal{S}$\nachieving $O(\\log N)$ random access time, and either $O(n\\cdot \\alpha_k(n))$\nconstruction time and space on the pointer machine model, or $O(n)$\nconstruction time and space on the RAM. Here, $\\alpha_k(n)$ is the inverse of\nthe $k^{th}$ row of Ackermann's function. Our representations also efficiently\nsupport decompression of any substring in $S$: we can decompress any substring\nof length $m$ in the same complexity as a single random access query and\nadditional $O(m)$ time. Combining these results with fast algorithms for\nuncompressed approximate string matching leads to several efficient algorithms\nfor approximate string matching on grammar-compressed strings without\ndecompression. For instance, we can find all approximate occurrences of a\npattern $P$ with at most $k$ errors in time $O(n(\\min\\{|P|k, k^4 + |P|\\} + \\log\nN) + occ)$, where $occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $S$. Finally, we\ngeneralize our results to navigation and other operations on grammar-compressed\nordered trees.\n  All of the above bounds significantly improve the currently best known\nresults. To achieve these bounds, we introduce several new techniques and data\nstructures of independent interest, including a predecessor data structure, two\n\"biased\" weighted ancestor data structures, and a compact representation of\nheavy paths in grammars.",

The\nclassical solution for this problem is the Aho-Corasick automaton which finds\nall occ occurrences in a text T in time O(|T| + occ) using a data structure\nthat occupies O(m log m) bits of space where m <= n + 1 is the number of states\nin the automaton.

To the\nbest of our knowledge, the currently fastest succinct data structure for the\ndictionary matching problem uses space O(n log sigma) while answering queries\nin O(|T|log log n + occ) time.

    "summary": "In the Densest k-Subgraph problem, given a graph G and a parameter k, one\nneeds to find a subgraph of G induced on k vertices that contains the largest\nnumber of edges. There is a significant gap between the best known upper and\nlower bounds for this problem. It is NP-hard, and does not have a PTAS unless\nNP has subexponential time algorithms. On the other hand, the current best\nknown algorithm of Feige, Kortsarz and Peleg, gives an approximation ratio of\nn^(1/3-epsilon) for some specific epsilon > 0 (estimated at around 1/60).\n  We present an algorithm that for every epsilon > 0 approximates the Densest\nk-Subgraph problem within a ratio of n^(1/4+epsilon) in time n^O(1/epsilon). In\nparticular, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of O(n^1/4) in time\nn^O(log n). Our algorithm is inspired by studying an average-case version of\nthe problem where the goal is to distinguish random graphs from graphs with\nplanted dense subgraphs. The approximation ratio we achieve for the general\ncase matches the distinguishing ratio we obtain for this planted problem.\n  At a high level, our algorithms involve cleverly counting appropriately\ndefined trees of constant size in G, and using these counts to identify the\nvertices of the dense subgraph. Our algorithm is based on the following\nprinciple. We say that a graph G(V,E) has log-density alpha if its average\ndegree is Theta(|V|^alpha). The algorithmic core of our result is a family of\nalgorithms that output k-subgraphs of nontrivial density whenever the\nlog-density of the densest k-subgraph is larger than the log-density of the\nhost graph.",

In this game the player is given an n by n board of tiles where each\ntile is allocated one of c colours. The goal is to make the colours of all\ntiles equal via the shortest possible sequence of flooding operations. In the\nstandard version, a flooding operation consists of the player choosing a colour\nk, which then changes the colour of all the tiles in the monochromatic region\nconnected to the top left tile to k. After this operation has been performed,\nneighbouring regions which are already of the chosen colour k will then also\nbecome connected, thereby extending the monochromatic region of the board. We\nshow that finding the minimum number of flooding operations is NP-hard for c>=3\nand that this even holds when the player can perform flooding operations from\nany position on the board. However, we show that this \"free\" variant is in P\nfor c=2.

    "summary": "Memetic Algorithms are known to be a powerful technique in solving hard\noptimization problems. To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host\nof decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among\nthem. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain\nconstant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal\npopulation size varies for different instances, local search procedures and\nrunning times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is\ncalculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the\naverage running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in\nmany applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and\ntherefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average\nrunning time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's\nrun. Some coefficients which are independent with respect to the instance or\nthe local search are to be tuned before the algorithm run; we provide a\nprocedure to find these coefficients. The proposed approach was used to develop\na memetic algorithm for the Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in\nthe case of s dimensions) which is an extension of the well-known assignment\nproblem. MAP is NP-hard and has a host of applications. We show that using\nadjustable population size makes the algorithm flexible to perform well for\ninstances of very different sizes and types and for different running times and\nlocal searches. This allows us to select the most efficient local search for\nevery instance type. The results of computational experiments for several\ninstance families and sizes prove that the proposed algorithm performs\nefficiently for a wide range of the running times and clearly outperforms the\nstate-of-the art 3-AP memetic algorithm being given the same time.",

We focus on a major cause of\nerrors in tile-based self-assembly: that of unintended growth due to \"weak\"\nstrength-1 bonds, which if allowed to persist, may be stabilized by subsequent\nattachment of neighboring tiles in the sense that at least energy 2 is now\nrequired to break apart the resulting assembly; i.e., the errant assembly is\nstable at temperature 2. We study a common self-assembly benchmark problem,\nthat of assembling an n x n square using O(log n) unique tile types, under the\ntwo-handed model of self-assembly. Our main result achieves a much stronger\nnotion of fault-tolerance than those achieved previously.

The\nstandard dynamic programming solution for this problem computes the\nedit-distance between a pair of strings of total length O(N) in O(N^2) time. To\nthis date, this quadratic upper-bound has never been substantially improved for\ngeneral strings. However, there are known techniques for breaking this bound in\ncase the strings are known to compress well under a particular compression\nscheme. The basic idea is to first compress the strings, and then to compute\nthe edit distance between the compressed strings. As it turns out, practically\nall known o(N^2) edit-distance algorithms work, in some sense, under the same\nparadigm described above. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a\nsingle edit-distance algorithm that works for strings which are compressed\nunder any compression scheme. A rephrasing of this question is to ask whether a\nsingle algorithm can exploit the compressibility properties of strings under\nany compression method, even if each string is compressed using a different\ncompression. In this paper we set out to answer this question by using straight\nline programs. These provide a generic platform for representing many popular\ncompression schemes including the LZ-family, Run-Length Encoding, Byte-Pair\nEncoding, and dictionary methods. For two strings of total length N having\nstraight-line program representations of total size n, we present an algorithm\nrunning in O(nN log(N/n)) time for computing the edit-distance of these two\nstrings under any rational scoring function, and an O(n^{2/3}N^{4/3}) time\nalgorithm for arbitrary scoring functions.

In this paper we derandomize their algorithm to get a\ndeterministic O(k^3 log n) factor algorithm.

    "summary": "We present a new parameterized algorithm for the {feedback vertex set}\nproblem ({\\sc fvs}) on undirected graphs. We approach the problem by\nconsidering a variation of it, the {disjoint feedback vertex set} problem ({\\sc\ndisjoint-fvs}), which finds a feedback vertex set of size $k$ that has no\noverlap with a given feedback vertex set $F$ of the graph $G$. We develop an\nimproved kernelization algorithm for {\\sc disjoint-fvs} and show that {\\sc\ndisjoint-fvs} can be solved in polynomial time when all vertices in $G\n\\setminus F$ have degrees upper bounded by three. We then propose a new\nbranch-and-search process on {\\sc disjoint-fvs}, and introduce a new\nbranch-and-search measure. The process effectively reduces a given graph to a\ngraph on which {\\sc disjoint-fvs} becomes polynomial-time solvable, and the new\nmeasure more accurately evaluates the efficiency of the process. These\nalgorithmic and combinatorial studies enable us to develop an\n$O^*(3.83^k)$-time parameterized algorithm for the general {\\sc fvs} problem,\nimproving all previous algorithms for the problem.",

    "summary": "There has been much progress on efficient algorithms for clustering data\npoints generated by a mixture of $k$ probability distributions under the\nassumption that the means of the distributions are well-separated, i.e., the\ndistance between the means of any two distributions is at least $\\Omega(k)$\nstandard deviations. These results generally make heavy use of the generative\nmodel and particular properties of the distributions. In this paper, we show\nthat a simple clustering algorithm works without assuming any generative\n(probabilistic) model. Our only assumption is what we call a \"proximity\ncondition\": the projection of any data point onto the line joining its cluster\ncenter to any other cluster center is $\\Omega(k)$ standard deviations closer to\nits own center than the other center. Here the notion of standard deviations is\nbased on the spectral norm of the matrix whose rows represent the difference\nbetween a point and the mean of the cluster to which it belongs. We show that\nin the generative models studied, our proximity condition is satisfied and so\nwe are able to derive most known results for generative models as corollaries\nof our main result. We also prove some new results for generative models -\ne.g., we can cluster all but a small fraction of points only assuming a bound\non the variance. Our algorithm relies on the well known $k$-means algorithm,\nand along the way, we prove a result of independent interest -- that the\n$k$-means algorithm converges to the \"true centers\" even in the presence of\nspurious points provided the initial (estimated) centers are close enough to\nthe corresponding actual centers and all but a small fraction of the points\nsatisfy the proximity condition. Finally, we present a new technique for\nboosting the ratio of inter-center separation to standard deviation.",

    "summary": "Given a weighted graph $G$ and an error parameter $\\epsilon > 0$, the {\\em\ngraph sparsification} problem requires sampling edges in $G$ and giving the\nsampled edges appropriate weights to obtain a sparse graph $G_{\\epsilon}$\n(containing O(n\\log n) edges in expectation) with the following property: the\nweight of every cut in $G_{\\epsilon}$ is within a factor of $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$\nof the weight of the corresponding cut in $G$. We provide a generic framework\nthat sets out sufficient conditions for any particular sampling scheme to\nresult in good sparsifiers, and obtain a set of results by simple\ninstantiations of this framework. The results we obtain include the following:\n(1) We improve the time complexity of graph sparsification from O(m\\log^3 n) to\nO(m + n\\log^4 n) for graphs with polynomial edge weights. (2) We improve the\ntime complexity of graph sparsification from O(m\\log^3 n) to O(m\\log^2 n) for\ngraphs with arbitrary edge weights.

(4) We show that sampling using standard\nconnectivities results in good sparsifiers, thus resolving an open question of\nBenczur and Karger. As a corollary, we give a simple proof of (a slightly\nweaker version of) a result due to Spielman and Srivastava showing that\nsampling using effective resistances produces good sparsifiers. (5) We give a\nsimple proof showing that sampling using strong connectivities results in good\nsparsifiers, a result obtained previously using a more involved proof by\nBenczur and Karger.

In general, the goal of a\nballs-into-bins process is to allocate a set of independent objects (tasks,\njobs, balls) to a set of resources (servers, bins, urns) and, thereby, to\nminimize the maximum load. In this paper, we analyze the maximum load for the\n{\\em chains-into-bins} problem, which is defined as follows. There are $n$\nbins, and $m$ objects to be allocated. Each object consists of balls connected\ninto a chain of length $\\ell$, so that there are $m \\ell$ balls in total. We\nassume the chains cannot be broken, and that the balls in one chain have to be\nallocated to $\\ell$ consecutive bins. We allow each chain $d$ independent and\nuniformly random bin choices for its starting position. The chain is allocated\nusing the rule that the maximum load of any bin receiving a ball of that chain\nis minimized.

At\nany time, the buffer cannot accommodate more than $B$ packets. Packets arrive\nover time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value. Packets leave\nthe buffer only because they are either sent or dropped. Those packets that\nhave left the buffer will not be reconsidered for delivery any more. In each\ntime step, at most one packet in the buffer can be sent. The order in which the\npackets are sent should comply with the order of their arrival time. The\nobjective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent in an online\nmanner. In this paper, we study a variant of this FIFO buffering model in which\na packet's value is either 1 or $\\alpha > 1$. We present a deterministic\nmemoryless 1.304-competitive algorithm.

Previously,\nno efficient polylogarithmic approximation algorithm was known for any\ncomputational task involving edit distance (e.g., nearest neighbor search or\nsketching).\n  This result arises naturally in the study of a new asymmetric query model. In\nthis model, the input consists of two strings x and y, and an algorithm can\naccess y in an unrestricted manner, while being charged for querying every\nsymbol of x. Indeed, we obtain our main result by designing an algorithm that\nmakes a small number of queries in this model. We then provide a\nnearly-matching lower bound on the number of queries.\n  Our lower bound is the first to expose hardness of edit distance stemming\nfrom the input strings being \"repetitive\", which means that many of their\nsubstrings are approximately identical.

Two interval graphs G_1 and G_2, sharing some vertices I\n(and the corresponding induced edges), are said to be `simultaneous interval\ngraphs' if there exist interval representations R_1 and R_2 of G_1 and G_2,\nsuch that any vertex of I is mapped to the same interval in both R_1 and R_2.\nEquivalently, G_1 and G_2 are simultaneous interval graphs if there exist edges\nE' between G_1-I and G_2-I such that G_1 \\cup G_2 \\cup E' is an interval graph.\n  Simultaneous representation problems are related to simultaneous planar\nembeddings, and have applications in any situation where it is desirable to\nconsistently represent two related graphs, for example: interval graphs\ncapturing overlaps of DNA fragments of two similar organisms; or graphs\nconnected in time, where one is an updated version of the other.\n  In this paper we give an O(n^2*logn) time algorithm for recognizing\nsimultaneous interval graphs,where n = |G_1 \\cup G_2|. This result complements\nthe polynomial time algorithms for recognizing probe interval graphs and\nprovides an efficient algorithm for the interval graph sandwich problem for the\nspecial case where the set of optional edges induce a complete bipartite graph.",

    "summary": "Clustering under most popular objective functions is NP-hard, even to\napproximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case.\nRecently, Bilu and Linial \\cite{Bilu09} suggested an approach aimed at\nbypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might\nhope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice\nshould be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an\nefficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are\nstable to perturbations of size $O(n^{1/2})$. In addition, they conjecture that\ninstances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in\npolynomial time. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for any\ncenter-based clustering objective (such as $k$-median, $k$-means, and\n$k$-center). Specifically, we show we can efficiently find the optimal\nclustering assuming only stability to factor-3 perturbations of the underlying\nmetric in spaces without Steiner points, and stability to factor $2+\\sqrt{3}$\nperturbations for general metrics. In particular, we show for such instances\nthat the popular Single-Linkage algorithm combined with dynamic programming\nwill find the optimal clustering. We also present NP-hardness results under a\nweaker but related condition.",

Our technique maintains a single\nbit per hash function, rather than a single integer, thus requiring a\nfingerprint of length $k = O(\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1}{\\delta}}{\\epsilon^2})$ bits,\nrather than $O(\\log u \\cdot \\frac{\\ln \\frac{1}{\\delta}}{\\epsilon^2})$ bits\nrequired by previous approaches.

    "summary": "Given an undirected graph $G$, a collection $\\{(s_1,t_1),..., (s_k,t_k)\\}$ of\npairs of vertices, and an integer $p$, the Edge Multicut problem ask if there\nis a set $S$ of at most $p$ edges such that the removal of $S$ disconnects\nevery $s_i$ from the corresponding $t_i$. Vertex Multicut is the analogous\nproblem where $S$ is a set of at most $p$ vertices. Our main result is that\nboth problems can be solved in time $2^{O(p^3)}... n^{O(1)}$, i.e.,\nfixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size $p$ of the cutset in the\nsolution. By contrast, it is unlikely that an algorithm with running time of\nthe form $f(p)... n^{O(1)}$ exists for the directed version of the problem, as\nwe show it to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the size of the cutset.",

We present a new spectral algorithm for\nthis problem which runs in time $\\tilde{O}(|E|/\\gamma)$ for $f=\\sqrt{\\gamma}.$\nOur result yields the first nearly-linear time algorithm for the classic\nBalanced Separator problem that achieves the asymptotically optimal\napproximation guarantee for spectral methods. Our method has the advantage of\nbeing conceptually simple and relies on a primal-dual semidefinite-programming\nSDP approach. We first consider a natural SDP relaxation for the Balanced\nSeparator problem. While it is easy to obtain from this SDP a certificate of\nthe fact that the graph has no balanced cut of conductance less than $\\gamma,$\nsomewhat surprisingly, we can obtain a certificate for the stronger correlation\ncondition.

    "summary": "We consider energy-efficient scheduling on multiprocessors, where the speed\nof each processor can be individually scaled, and a processor consumes power\n$s^{\\alpha}$ when running at speed $s$, for $\\alpha>1$. A scheduling algorithm\nneeds to decide at any time both processor allocations and processor speeds for\na set of parallel jobs with time-varying parallelism. The objective is to\nminimize the sum of the total energy consumption and certain performance\nmetric, which in this paper includes total flow time and makespan. For both\nobjectives, we present instantaneous parallelism clairvoyant (IP-clairvoyant)\nalgorithms that are aware of the instantaneous parallelism of the jobs at any\ntime but not their future characteristics, such as remaining parallelism and\nwork. For total flow time plus energy, we present an $O(1)$-competitive\nalgorithm, which significantly improves upon the best known non-clairvoyant\nalgorithm and is the first constant competitive result on multiprocessor speed\nscaling for parallel jobs. In the case of makespan plus energy, which is\nconsidered for the first time in the literature, we present an\n$O(\\ln^{1-1/\\alpha}P)$-competitive algorithm, where $P$ is the total number of\nprocessors. We show that this algorithm is asymptotically optimal by providing\na matching lower bound.

    "summary": "We study the problem of learning to rank from pairwise preferences, and solve\na long-standing open problem that has led to development of many heuristics but\nno provable results for our particular problem. Given a set $V$ of $n$\nelements, we wish to linearly order them given pairwise preference labels. A\npairwise preference label is obtained as a response, typically from a human, to\nthe question \"which if preferred, u or v?$ for two elements $u,v\\in V$. We\nassume possible non-transitivity paradoxes which may arise naturally due to\nhuman mistakes or irrationality. The goal is to linearly order the elements\nfrom the most preferred to the least preferred, while disagreeing with as few\npairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two\nparameters: The loss and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference\nlabels we obtain). This is a typical learning problem, with the exception that\nthe space from which the pairwise preferences is drawn is finite, consisting of\n${n\\choose 2}$ possibilities only. We present an active learning algorithm for\nthis problem, with query bounds significantly beating general (non active)\nbounds for the same error guarantee, while almost achieving the information\ntheoretical lower bound. Our main construct is a decomposition of the input\ns.t. (i) each block incurs high loss at optimum, and (ii) the optimal solution\nrespecting the decomposition is not much worse than the true opt. The\ndecomposition is done by adapting a recent result by Kenyon and Schudy for a\nrelated combinatorial optimization problem to the query efficient setting. We\nthus settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank theoreticians and\npractitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? To\nfurther show the power and practicality of our solution, we show how to use it\nin concert with an SVM relaxation.",

The\nobjective of the BMP is to place a set of probe sequences in the array and find\nan embedding (deposition of nucleotides/residues to the array cells) such that\nthe sum of border length is minimized. A variant of the problem, called P-BMP,\nis that the placement is given and the concern is simply to find the embedding.\nApproximation algorithms have been previously proposed for the problem but it\nis unknown whether the problem is NP-hard or not. In this paper, we give a\nthorough study of different variations of BMP by giving NP-hardness proofs and\nimproved approximation algorithms. We show that P-BMP, 1D-BMP, and BMP are all\nNP-hard. Contrast with the previous result that 1D-P-BMP is polynomial time\nsolvable, the interesting implications include (i) the array dimension (1D or\n2D) differentiates the complexity of P-BMP; (ii) for 1D array, whether\nplacement is given differentiates the complexity of BMP; (iii) BMP is NP-hard\nregardless of the dimension of the array.

    "summary": "In a ground-breaking paper, Indyk and Woodruff (STOC 05) showed how to\ncompute $F_k$ (for $k>2$) in space complexity $O(\\mbox{\\em poly-log}(n,m)\\cdot\nn^{1-\\frac2k})$, which is optimal up to (large) poly-logarithmic factors in $n$\nand $m$, where $m$ is the length of the stream and $n$ is the upper bound on\nthe number of distinct elements in a stream. The best known lower bound for\nlarge moments is $\\Omega(\\log(n)n^{1-\\frac2k})$. A follow-up work of\nBhuvanagiri, Ganguly, Kesh and Saha (SODA 2006) reduced the poly-logarithmic\nfactors of Indyk and Woodruff to $O(\\log^2(m)\\cdot (\\log n+ \\log m)\\cdot\nn^{1-{2\\over k}})$. Further reduction of poly-log factors has been an elusive\ngoal since 2006, when Indyk and Woodruff method seemed to hit a natural\n\"barrier.\" Using our simple recursive sketch, we provide a different yet simple\napproach to obtain a $O(\\log(m)\\log(nm)\\cdot (\\log\\log n)^4\\cdot n^{1-{2\\over\nk}})$ algorithm for constant $\\epsilon$ (our bound is, in fact, somewhat\nstronger, where the $(\\log\\log n)$ term can be replaced by any constant number\nof $\\log $ iterations instead of just two or three, thus approaching $log^*n$.\nOur bound also works for non-constant $\\epsilon$ (for details see the body of\nthe paper). Further, our algorithm requires only $4$-wise independence, in\ncontrast to existing methods that use pseudo-random generators for computing\nlarge frequency moments.",

    "publish": "2010-11-11T08:13:15Z", 
    "summary": "The celebrated dimension reduction lemma of Johnson and Lindenstrauss has\nnumerous computational and other applications. Due to its application in\npractice, speeding up the computation of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss style\ndimension reduction is an important question. Recently, Dasgupta, Kumar, and\nSarlos (STOC 2010) constructed such a transform that uses a sparse matrix. This\nis motivated by the desire to speed up the computation when applied to sparse\ninput vectors, a scenario that comes up in applications. The sparsity of their\nconstruction was further improved by Kane and Nelson (ArXiv 2010).\n  We improve the previous bound on the number of non-zero entries per column of\nKane and Nelson from $O(1/\\epsilon \\log(1/\\delta)\\log(k/\\delta))$ (where the\ntarget dimension is $k$, the distortion is $1\\pm \\epsilon$, and the failure\nprobability is $\\delta$) to $$ O\\left({1\\over\\epsilon}\n\\left({\\log(1/\\delta)\\log\\log\\log(1/\\delta) \\over\n\\log\\log(1/\\delta)}\\right)^2\\right). $$\n  We also improve the amount of randomness needed to generate the matrix. Our\nresults are obtained by connecting the moments of an order 2 Rademacher chaos\nto the combinatorial properties of random Eulerian multigraphs. Estimating the\nchance that a random multigraph is composed of a given number of node-disjoint\nEulerian components leads to a new tail bound on the chaos. Our estimates may\nbe of independent interest, and as this part of the argument is decoupled from\nthe analysis of the coefficients of the chaos, we believe that our methods can\nbe useful in the analysis of other chaoses.",

    "summary": "In this paper we study minimum cut and maximum flow problems on planar\ngraphs, both in static and in dynamic settings. First, we present an algorithm\nthat given an undirected planar graph computes the minimum cut between any two\ngiven vertices in O(n log log n) time. Second, we show how to achieve the same\nO(n log log n) bound for the problem of computing maximum flows in undirected\nplanar graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for\nthose two problems that break the O(n log n) barrier, which has been standing\nfor more than 25 years. Third, we present a fully dynamic algorithm that is\nable to maintain information about minimum cuts and maximum flows in a plane\ngraph (i.e., a planar graph with a fixed embedding): our algorithm is able to\ninsert edges, delete edges and answer min-cut and max-flow queries between any\npair of vertices in O(n^(2/3) log^3 n) time per operation.

    "summary": "In this paper, we explore worst-case solutions for the problems of single and\nmultiple matching on strings in the word RAM model with word length w. In the\nfirst problem, we have to build a data structure based on a pattern p of length\nm over an alphabet of size sigma such that we can answer to the following\nquery: given a text T of length n, where each character is encoded using\nlog(sigma) bits return the positions of all the occurrences of p in T (in the\nfollowing we refer by occ to the number of reported occurrences). For the\nmulti-pattern matching problem we have a set S of d patterns of total length m\nand a query on a text T consists in finding all positions of all occurrences in\nT of the patterns in S. As each character of the text is encoded using log\nsigma bits and we can read w bits in constant time in the RAM model, we assume\nthat we can read up to (w/log sigma) consecutive characters of the text in one\ntime step. This implies that the fastest possible query time for both problems\nis O((n(log sigma/w)+occ). In this paper we present several different results\nfor both problems which come close to that best possible query time. We first\npresent two different linear space data structures for the first and second\nproblem: the first one answers to single pattern matching queries in time\nO(n(1/m+log sigma/w)+occ) while the second one answers to multiple pattern\nmatching queries to O(n((log d+log y+log log d)/y+log sigma/w)+occ) where y is\nthe length of the shortest pattern in the case of multiple pattern-matching. We\nthen show how a simple application of the four russian technique permits to get\ndata structures with query times independent of the length of the shortest\npattern (the length of the only pattern in case of single string matching) at\nthe expense of using more space.",

The subpaths between the via edges have to be\nunique shortest paths. Instead of via edges also via nodes can be used, though\nthis requires some simple preprocessing. The second method uses contraction\nhierarchies to replace subpaths of the original path by shortcuts. The two\nmethods can be combined with each other. Also, we propose the application to\nmobile server based routing: We compute the route on a server which has access\nto the latest information about congestions for example. Then we transmit the\ncomputed route to the car using some mobile radio communication. There, we\napply the compression to save costs and transmission time. If the compression\nworks well, we can transmit routes even when the bandwidth is low. Although we\nhave not evaluated our ideas with realistic data yet, they are quite promising.",

Given a metric denoting\ndistances between vertices, a depot r containing k vehicles with possibly\ndifferent speeds, the goal is to find a tour for each vehicle (starting and\nending at r), so that every vertex is covered in some tour and the maximum\ncompletion time is minimized. This problem is precisely Heterogenous CVRP when\nvehicles are uncapacitated.\n  The presence of non-uniform speeds introduces difficulties for employing\nstandard tour-splitting techniques. In order to get a better understanding of\nthis technique in our context, we appeal to ideas from the 2-approximation for\nscheduling in parallel machine of Lenstra et al.. This motivates the\nintroduction of a new approximate MST construction called Level-Prim, which is\nrelated to Light Approximate Shortest-path Trees. The last component of our\nalgorithm involves partitioning the Level-Prim tree and matching the resulting\nparts to vehicles. This decomposition is more subtle than usual since now we\nneed to enforce correlation between the size of the parts and their distances\nto the depot.",

Complex systems (like large databases or networks)\nthat have a graph structure should be properly visualized in order to avoid\nobfuscation. One way to provide an aesthetic improvement to a graph\nvisualization is to apply a force-directed drawing algorithm to it. This\nmethod, that emerged in the 60's views graphs as spring systems that exert\nforces (repulsive or attractive) to the nodes.\n  A Lombardi drawing of a graph is a drawing where the edges are drawn as\ncircular arcs (straight edges are considered circular arcs of infinite radius)\nwith perfect angular resolution. This means, that consecutive edges around a\nvertex are equally spaced around it. In other words, each angle between the\ntangents of two consecutive edges is equal to $2\\pi/d$ where d is the degree of\nthat specific vertex. The requirement of using circular edges in graphs when we\nwant to provide perfect angular resolution is necessary, since even cycle\ngraphs cannot be drawn with straight edges when perfect angular resolution is\nneeded.\n  In this survey, we provide an algorithm that takes as input a random drawing\nof a graph and provides its Lombardi drawing, giving a proper visualization of\nthe graph.",

    "summary": "Bipartite Correlation clustering is the problem of generating a set of\ndisjoint bi-cliques on a set of nodes while minimizing the symmetric difference\nto a bipartite input graph. The number or size of the output clusters is not\nconstrained in any way. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem\ngives a factor of 11. This result and all previous ones involve solving large\nlinear or semi-definite programs which become prohibitive even for modestly\nsized tasks. In this paper we present an improved factor 4 approximation\nalgorithm to this problem using a simple combinatorial algorithm which does not\nrequire solving large convex programs. The analysis extends a method developed\nby Ailon, Charikar and Alantha in 2008, where a randomized pivoting algorithm\nwas analyzed for obtaining a 3-approximation algorithm for Correlation\nClustering, which is the same problem on graphs (not bipartite). The analysis\nfor Correlation Clustering there required defining events for structures\ncontaining 3 vertices and using the probability of these events to produce a\nfeasible solution to a dual of a certain natural LP bounding the optimal cost.\nIt is tempting here to use sets of 4 vertices, which are the smallest\nstructures for which contradictions arise for Bipartite Correlation Clustering.\nThis simple idea, however, appears to be evasive. We show that, by modifying\nthe LP, we can analyze algorithms which take into consideration subgraph\nstructures of unbounded size.

    "summary": "Finding heavy-elements (heavy-hitters) in streaming data is one of the\ncentral, and well-understood tasks. Despite the importance of this problem,\nwhen considering the sliding windows model of streaming (where elements\neventually expire) the problem of finding L_2-heavy elements has remained\ncompletely open despite multiple papers and considerable success in finding\nL_1-heavy elements.\n  In this paper, we develop the first poly-logarithmic-memory algorithm for\nfinding L_2-heavy elements in sliding window model. Since L_2 heavy elements\nplay a central role for many fundamental streaming problems (such as frequency\nmoments), we believe our method would be extremely useful for many\nsliding-windows algorithms and applications. For example, our technique allows\nus not only to find L_2-heavy elements, but also heavy elements with respect to\nany L_p for 0<p<2 on sliding windows. Thus, our paper completely resolves the\nquestion of finding L_p-heavy elements for sliding windows with\npoly-logarithmic memory for all values of p since it is well known that for p>2\nthis task is impossible.\n  Our method may have other applications as well. We demonstrate a broader\napplicability of our novel yet simple method on two additional examples: we\nshow how to obtain a sliding window approximation of other properties such as\nthe similarity of two streams, or the fraction of elements that appear exactly\na specified number of times within the window (the rarity problem).

    "summary": "A hitting set for a collection of sets is a set that has a non-empty\nintersection with each set in the collection; the hitting set problem is to\nfind a hitting set of minimum cardinality. Motivated by instances of the\nhitting set problem where the number of sets to be hit is large, we introduce\nthe notion of implicit hitting set problems. In an implicit hitting set problem\nthe collection of sets to be hit is typically too large to list explicitly;\ninstead, an oracle is provided which, given a set H, either determines that H\nis a hitting set or returns a set that H does not hit. We show a number of\nexamples of classic implicit hitting set problems, and give a generic algorithm\nfor solving such problems optimally. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that this framework is valuable in developing approximation algorithms. We\nillustrate this methodology by presenting a simple on-line algorithm for the\nminimum feedback vertex set problem on random graphs. In particular our\nalgorithm gives a feedback vertex set of size n-(1/p)\\log{np}(1-o(1)) with\nprobability at least 3/4 for the random graph G_{n,p} (the smallest feedback\nvertex set is of size n-(2/p)\\log{np}(1+o(1))). We also consider a planted\nmodel for the feedback vertex set in directed random graphs. Here we show that\na hitting set for a polynomial-sized subset of cycles is a hitting set for the\nplanted random graph and this allows us to exactly recover the planted feedback\nvertex set.",

    "summary": "We study frequency allocation in wireless networks. A wireless network is\nmodeled by an undirected graph, with vertices corresponding to cells. In each\nvertex we have a certain number of requests, and each of those requests must be\nassigned a different frequency. Edges represent conflicts between cells,\nmeaning that frequencies in adjacent vertices must be different as well. The\nobjective is to minimize the total number of used frequencies.\n  The offline version of the problem is known to be NP-hard. In the incremental\nversion, requests for frequencies arrive over time and the algorithm is\nrequired to assign a frequency to a request as soon as it arrives. Competitive\nincremental algorithms have been studied for several classes of graphs. For\npaths, the optimal (asymptotic) ratio is known to be 4/3, while for\nhexagonal-cell graphs it is between 1.5 and 1.9126. For k-colorable graphs, the\nratio of (k+1)/2 can be achieved.\n  In this paper, we prove nearly tight bounds on the asymptotic competitive\nratio for bipartite graphs, showing that it is between 1.428 and 1.433. This\nimproves the previous lower bound of 4/3 and upper bound of 1.5.

Surprisingly, for most cases only 8-wise\nindependent is needed for exponential time and space improvement. Moreover, we\nbypass the $O(\\log{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}})$ independent lower bound for\napproximately \\minwise functions \\cite{patrascu10kwise-lb}, as we use\nalternative definition. In addition, as the independent's degree is a small\nconstant it can be implemented efficiently.\n  Informally, under this definition, all subsets of size $d$ of any fixed set\n$X$ have an equal probability to have hash values among the minimal $k$ values\nin $X$, where the probability is over the random choice of hash function from\nthe family. This property measures the randomness of the family, as choosing a\ntruly random function, obviously, satisfies the definition for $d=k=|X|$.

What\ncan we say when either or both of these assumptions are changed?\n  The stochastic knapsack problem is of interest in its own right, but\ntechniques developed for it are applicable to other stochastic packing\nproblems. Indeed, ideas for this problem have been useful for budgeted learning\nproblems, where one is given several arms which evolve in a specified\nstochastic fashion with each pull, and the goal is to pull the arms a total of\nB times to maximize the reward obtained. Much recent work on this problem focus\non the case when the evolution of the arms follows a martingale, i.e., when the\nexpected reward from the future is the same as the reward at the current state.\nWhat can we say when the rewards do not form a martingale?\n  In this paper, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the\nstochastic knapsack problem with correlations and/or cancellations, and also\nfor budgeted learning problems where the martingale condition is not satisfied.\nIndeed, we can show that previously proposed LP relaxations have large\nintegrality gaps.

The\nmodeling flexibility of hypergraphs however, comes at a cost: algorithms on\nhypergraphs are inherently more complicated than those on graphs, which\nsometimes translate to nontrivial increases in processing times. Neither the\nmodeling flexibility of hypergraphs, nor the runtime efficiency of graph\nalgorithms can be overlooked. Therefore, the new research thrust should be how\nto cleverly trade-off between the two. This work addresses one method for this\ntrade-off by solving the hypergraph partitioning problem by finding vertex\nseparators on graphs. Specifically, we investigate how to solve the hypergraph\npartitioning problem by seeking a vertex separator on its net intersection\ngraph (NIG), where each net of the hypergraph is represented by a vertex, and\ntwo vertices share an edge if their nets have a common vertex.

Though their refinements which\nonly reduce the total number of vertical lines in Miller's algorithm, did not\ngive an efficient computation as other optimizations, but they can be applied\nfor computing \\emph{both} of Weil and Tate pairings on \\emph{all}\npairing-friendly elliptic curves. In this paper we extend the Blake-Murty-Xu's\nmethod and show how to perform an elimination of all vertical lines in Miller's\nalgorithm during Weil/Tate pairings computation on \\emph{general} elliptic\ncurves. Experimental results show that our algorithm is faster about 25% in\ncomparison with the original Miller's algorithm.",

The input is a set of demand locations in a metric space and a fleet\nof k vehicles each of capacity Q. The objective is to locate k depots, one for\neach vehicle, and compute routes for the vehicles so that all demands are\nsatisfied and the total cost is minimized. Our main result is a constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for this problem. To achieve this result, we reduce to\nthe k-median-forest problem, which generalizes both k-median and minimum\nspanning tree, and which might be of independent interest. We give a\n(3+c)-approximation algorithm for k-median-forest, which leads to a\n(12+c)-approximation algorithm for the above location-routing problem, for any\nconstant c>0. The algorithm for k-median-forest is just t-swap local search,\nand we prove that it has locality gap 3+2/t; this generalizes the corresponding\nresult known for k-median. Finally we consider the \"non-uniform\"\nk-median-forest problem which has different cost functions for the MST and\nk-median parts. We show that the locality gap for this problem is unbounded\neven under multi-swaps, which contrasts with the uniform case.

However, more\nrecent work has shown that while these generative models do have the right\ndegree distribution, they are not good models for real life networks due to\ntheir differences on other important metrics like conductance. We believe this\nis, in part, because many of these real-world networks have very different\njoint degree distributions, i.e. the probability that a randomly selected edge\nwill be between nodes of degree k and l. Assortativity is a sufficient\nstatistic of the joint degree distribution, and it has been previously noted\nthat social networks tend to be assortative, while biological and technological\nnetworks tend to be disassortative.\n  We suggest understanding the relationship between network structure and the\njoint degree distribution of graphs is an interesting avenue of further\nresearch. An important tool for such studies are algorithms that can generate\nrandom instances of graphs with the same joint degree distribution. This is the\nmain topic of this paper and we study the problem from both a theoretical and\npractical perspective.

The two morals of this work are: 1) any judgement of the recovery\nperformance of one algorithm over that of another must be prefaced by the\nconditions for which this is observed to be true, including sparse vector\ndistributions, and the criterion for exact recovery; and 2) a recovery\nalgorithm must be selected carefully based on what distribution one expects to\nunderlie the sensed sparse signal.",

    "summary": "We study the fundamental problem of reliable interactive communication over a\nnoisy channel. In a breakthrough sequence of papers published in 1992 and 1993,\nSchulman gave non-constructive proofs of the existence of general methods to\nemulate any two-party interactive protocol such that: (1) the emulation\nprotocol takes a constant-factor longer than the original protocol, and (2) if\nthe emulation protocol is executed over a noisy channel, then the probability\nthat the emulation protocol fails is exponentially small in the total length of\nthe protocol. Unfortunately, Schulman's emulation procedures either only work\nin a model with a large amount of shared randomness, or are non-constructive in\nthat they rely on the existence of good tree codes. The only known proofs of\nthe existence of good tree codes are non-constructive, and finding an explicit\nconstruction remains an important open problem. Indeed, randomly generated tree\ncodes are not good tree codes with overwhelming probability.\n  In this work, we revisit the problem of reliable interactive communication,\nand obtain the following results: We introduce a new notion of goodness for a\ntree code, and define the notion of a potent tree code. We believe that this\nnotion is of independent interest. We prove the correctness of an explicit\nemulation procedure based on any potent tree code. We show that a randomly\ngenerated tree code (with suitable constant alphabet size) is a potent tree\ncode with overwhelming probability. Furthermore we are able to partially\nderandomize this result using only O(n) random bits, where $n$ is the depth of\nthe tree.\n  These results allow us to obtain the first fully explicit emulation procedure\nfor reliable interactive communication over noisy channels with a constant\ncommunication overhead, and exponentially small failure probability.",

We consider the algorithmic problem of locating the longest\nsuch substring, as well as other related problems (such as finding the shortest\nsubstring or a maximal set of disjoint substrings). For locating the longest\nsuch substring, we develop an algorithm that runs in O(n) time, improving upon\nthe previous best-known O(n log n) result. For the related problems we develop\nO(n log log n) algorithms, again improving upon the best-known O(n log n)\nresults.

Vizing's theorem states that\nthe edge coloring of a simple graph $G$ requires either $\\Delta$ or $\\Delta+1$\ncolors, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of $G$. Holyer proved that\nit is {\\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $G$ is $\\Delta$-edge-colorable even\nfor cubic graphs. By introducing the concept of complex colors, we show that\nthe color-exchange operation follows the same multiplication rules as\nquaternion.

It is straightforward that the algorithm achieves stabilization\nalmost surely from any initial configuration, and it is known that the\nworst-case expected time to stabilization (with respect to the initial\nconfiguration) is Theta(N^2). Our first contribution is to give an upper bound\nof 0.64 N^2 on the expected stabilization time, improving on previous upper\nbounds and reducing the gap with the best existing lower bound. We also\nintroduce an asynchronous version of the protocol, showing a similar O(N^2)\nconvergence bound in this case. Assuming that errors arise from the corruption\nof some number k of bits, where k is fixed independently of the size of the\nring, we show that the expected time to stabilization is O(N).

Our main\ncontribution is an algorithm with running time $4^{k+O(\\log^2 k)} + n^{O(1)}$\nfor Path-Contractibility and an algorithm with running time $4.88^k n^{O(1)}$\nfor Tree-Contractibility, based on a novel application of the color coding\ntechnique of Alon, Yuster and Zwick. Furthermore, we show that\nPath-Contractibility has a kernel with at most $5k+3$ vertices, while\nTree-Contractibility does not have a polynomial kernel unless coNP $\\subseteq$\nNP/poly. We find the latter result surprising, because of the strong connection\nbetween Tree-Contractibility and Feedback Vertex Set, which is known to have a\nvertex kernel with size $O(k^2)$.",

    "summary": "The minimum-cost subset $k$-connected subgraph problem is a cornerstone\nproblem in the area of network design with vertex connectivity requirements. In\nthis problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with costs on edges and a set of\nterminals $T$. The goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph such that every pair\nof terminals are connected by $k$ openly (vertex) disjoint paths. In this\npaper, we present an approximation algorithm for the subset $k$-connected\nsubgraph problem which improves on the previous best approximation guarantee of\n$O(k^2\\log{k})$ by Nutov (FOCS 2009). Our approximation guarantee,\n$\\alpha(|T|)$, depends upon the number of terminals: [\\alpha(|T|) \\ \\ =\\ \\\nO(|T|^2) & if |T| < 2k O(k \\log^2 k) & if 2k\\le |T| < k^2 O(k \\log k) & if |T|\n\\ge k^2]\n  So, when the number of terminals is {\\em large enough}, the approximation\nguarantee improves significantly. Moreover, we show that, given an\napproximation algorithm for $|T|=k$, we can obtain almost the same\napproximation guarantee for any instances with $|T|> k$. This suggests that the\nhardest instances of the problem are when $|T|\\approx k$.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we study the non-bipartite maximum matching problem in the\nsemi-streaming model. The maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model\nhas received a significant amount of attention lately. While the problem has\nbeen somewhat well solved for bipartite graphs, the known algorithms for\nnon-bipartite graphs use $2^{\\frac1\\epsilon}$ passes or $n^{\\frac1\\epsilon}$\ntime to compute a $(1-\\epsilon)$ approximation. In this paper we provide the\nfirst FPTAS (polynomial in $n,\\frac1\\epsilon$) for the problem which is\nefficient in both the running time and the number of passes. We also show that\nwe can estimate the size of the matching in $O(\\frac1\\epsilon)$ passes using\nslightly superlinear space.\n  To achieve both results, we use the structural properties of the matching\npolytope such as the laminarity of the tight sets and total dual integrality.\nThe algorithms are iterative, and are based on the fractional packing and\ncovering framework. However the formulations herein require exponentially many\nvariables or constraints. We use laminarity, metric embeddings and graph\nsparsification to reduce the space required by the algorithms in between and\nacross the iterations. This is the first use of these ideas in the\nsemi-streaming model to solve a combinatorial optimization problem.",

    "summary": "In computational phylogenetics, the problem of constructing a supertree of a\ngiven set of rooted input trees can be formalized in different ways, to cope\nwith contradictory information in the input. We consider the Minimum Flip\nSupertree problem, where the input trees are transformed into a 0/1/?-matrix,\nsuch that each row represents a taxon, and each column represents an inner node\nof one of the input trees. Our goal is to find a perfect phylogeny for the\ninput matrix requiring a minimum number of 0/1-flips, that is, corrections of\n0/1-entries in the matrix. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Here, we\npresent a parameterized data reduction with polynomial running time.

We then make our data reduction\nparameter-independent by using upper bounds. This allows us to preprocess an\ninstance, and to solve the reduced instance with an arbitrary method. Different\nfrom an existing data reduction for the consensus tree problem, our reduction\nallows us to draw conclusions about certain entries in the matrix.

Unfortunately, we find that the\nMinimum Flip Supertree problem is also hard in practice: The amount of\ninformation that can be derived during data reduction diminishes as instances\nget more \"complicated\", and running times for \"complicated\" instances quickly\nbecome prohibitive.

One such standard setting is when memory\nis arranged in large pages, and a major cost is the number of page accesses. We\npropose the study of cuckoo hashing with pages, advocating approaches where\neach key has several possible locations, or cells, on a single page, and\nadditional choices on a second backup page.

    "publish": "2011-04-28T14:18:26Z", 
    "summary": "Cuckoo hashing [4] is a multiple choice hashing scheme in which each item can\nbe placed in multiple locations, and collisions are resolved by moving items to\ntheir alternative locations. In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo\nhashing, the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets.\nEach item is hashed to two buckets, and may be stored in any of the positions\nwithin those buckets. Ref. [2] analyzed a variation in which the buckets are\ncontiguous and overlap. However, many systems retrieve data from secondary\nstorage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively\nexpensive process; but once a page is fetched, its contents can be accessed\norders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval,\npresenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint:\neach bucket must be fully contained in a single page, but buckets are not\nnecessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases\nmemory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an\nitem. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two, the page size is\n8, and each bucket is fully contained in a single page, the memory utilization\nequals 89.71% in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant, 93.78% in\nthe contiguous overlapping bucket variant, and increases to 97.46% in our new\nnon-contiguous bucket variant. When the memory utilization is 92% and we use\nbreadth first search to look for a vacant position, the number of iterations\nrequired to insert a new item is dramatically reduced from 545 in the\ncontiguous overlapping buckets variant to 52 in our new non-contiguous bucket\nvariant. In addition to the empirical results, we present a theoretical lower\nbound on the memory utilization of our variation as a function of the page\nsize.",

    "summary": "We show that the pseudoflow algorithm for maximum flow is particularly\nefficient for the bipartite matching problem both in theory and in practice. We\ndevelop several implementations of the pseudoflow algorithm for bipartite\nmatching, and compare them over a wide set of benchmark instances to\nstate-of-the-art implementations of push-relabel and augmenting path algorithms\nthat are specifically designed to solve these problems. The experiments show\nthat the pseudoflow variants are in most cases faster than the other\nalgorithms.\n  We also show that one particular implementation---the matching pseudoflow\nalgorithm---is theoretically efficient. For a graph with $n$ nodes, $m$ arcs,\n$n_1$ the size of the smaller set in the bipartition, and the maximum matching\nvalue $\\kappa \\leq n_1$, the algorithm's complexity given input in the form of\nadjacency lists is $O(\\min{n_1\\kappa,m} + \\sqrt{\\kappa}\\min{\\kappa^2,m})$.\nSimilar algorithmic ideas are shown to work for an adaptation of Hopcroft and\nKarp's bipartite matching algorithm with the same complexity. Using boolean\noperations on words of size $\\lambda$, the complexity of the pseudoflow\nalgorithm is further improved to $O(\\min{n_1\\kappa, \\frac{n_1n_2}{\\lambda}, m}\n+ \\kappa^2 + \\frac{\\kappa^{2.5}}{\\lambda})$. This run time is faster than for\nprevious algorithms such as Cheriyan and Mehlhorn's algorithm of complexity\n$O(\\frac{n^{2.5}}{\\lambda})$.",

    "summary": "Consider a bin containing $n$ balls colored with two colors. In a $k$-query,\n$k$ balls are selected by a questioner and the oracle's reply is related\n(depending on the computation model being considered) to the distribution of\ncolors of the balls in this $k$-tuple; however, the oracle never reveals the\ncolors of the individual balls. Following a number of queries the questioner is\nsaid to determine the majority color if it can output a ball of the majority\ncolor if it exists, and can prove that there is no majority if it does not\nexist. We investigate two computation models (depending on the type of replies\nbeing allowed). We give algorithms to compute the minimum number of 3-queries\nwhich are needed so that the questioner can determine the majority color and\nprovide tight and almost tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries\nneeded in each case.",

Our first algorithm handles $m$ arc additions in $O(m^{3/2})$\ntime. For sparse graphs ($m/n = O(1)$), this bound improves the best previous\nbound by a logarithmic factor, and is tight to within a constant factor among\nalgorithms satisfying a natural {\\em locality} property. Our second algorithm\nhandles an arbitrary sequence of arc additions in $O(n^{5/2})$ time. For\nsufficiently dense graphs, this bound improves the best previous bound by a\npolynomial factor. Our bound may be far from tight: we show that the algorithm\ncan take $\\Omega(n^2 2^{\\sqrt{2\\lg n}})$ time by relating its performance to a\ngeneralization of the $k$-levels problem of combinatorial geometry. A\ncompletely different algorithm running in $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$ time was given\nrecently by Bender, Fineman, and Gilbert.

The\nperformance guarantee of these algorithms is well understood, but the\nworst-case lower bounds seem somewhat contrived and it is questionable if they\narise in practical applications. To find out how robust these bounds are, we\nstudy the algorithms in the framework of smoothed analysis, in which instances\nare subject to some degree of random noise.\n  While the lower bounds for all scheduling variants with restricted machines\nare rather robust, we find out that the bounds are fragile for unrestricted\nmachines. In particular, we show that the smoothed performance guarantee of the\njump and the lex-jump algorithm are (in contrast to the worst case) independent\nof the number of machines. They are Theta(phi) and Theta(log(phi)),\nrespectively, where 1/phi is a parameter measuring the magnitude of the\nperturbation. The latter immediately implies that also the smoothed price of\nanarchy is Theta(log(phi)) for routing games on parallel links. Additionally we\nshow that for unrestricted machines also the greedy list scheduling algorithm\nhas an approximation guarantee of Theta(log(phi)).",

    "summary": "First, we study the Unconstrained Fault-Tolerant Resource Allocation (UFTRA)\nproblem (a.k.a. FTFA problem in \\cite{shihongftfa}). In the problem, we are\ngiven a set of sites equipped with an unconstrained number of facilities as\nresources, and a set of clients with set $\\mathcal{R}$ as corresponding\nconnection requirements, where every facility belonging to the same site has an\nidentical opening (operating) cost and every client-facility pair has a\nconnection cost. The objective is to allocate facilities from sites to satisfy\n$\\mathcal{R}$ at a minimum total cost. Next, we introduce the Constrained\nFault-Tolerant Resource Allocation (CFTRA) problem. It differs from UFTRA in\nthat the number of resources available at each site $i$ is limited by $R_{i}$.\nBoth problems are practical extensions of the classical Fault-Tolerant Facility\nLocation (FTFL) problem \\cite{Jain00FTFL}. For instance, their solutions\nprovide optimal resource allocation (w.r.t. enterprises) and leasing (w.r.t.\nclients) strategies for the contemporary cloud platforms.\n  In this paper, we consider the metric version of the problems.

Based on a result of Fortnow and Santhanam (JCSS\n2011), Bodlaender et al. (JCSS 2009) showed that, unless NP \\subseteq\ncoNP/poly, the existence of a deterministic polynomial-time composition\nalgorithm, i.e., an algorithm which outputs an instance of bounded parameter\nvalue which is yes if and only if one of t input instances is yes, rules out\nthe existence of polynomial kernels for a problem. Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC\n2010) continued this line of research and, amongst others, were able to rule\nout kernels of size O(k^d-eps) for certain problems, assuming NP !\\subseteq\ncoNP/poly. Their work implies that even the existence of a co-nondeterministic\ncomposition rules out polynomial kernels.\n  In this work we present the first example of how co-nondeterminism can help\nto make a composition algorithm. We study a Ramsey-type problem: Given a graph\nG and an integer k, the question is whether G contains an independent set or a\nclique of size at least k. It was asked by Rod Downey whether this problem\nadmits a polynomial kernelization. We provide a co-nondeterministic composition\nbased on embedding t instances into a single host graph H. The crux is that the\nhost graph H needs to observe a bound of L \\in O(log t) on both its maximum\nindependent set and maximum clique size, while also having a cover of its\nvertex set by independent sets and cliques all of size L; the\nco-nondeterministic composition is build around the search for such graphs.\nThus we show that, unless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly, the problem does not admit a\nkernelization with polynomial size guarantee.",

    "summary": "Smoothed analysis of multiobjective 0-1 linear optimization has drawn\nconsiderable attention recently. The number of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e.,\nsolutions with the property that no other solution is at least as good in all\nthe coordinates and better in at least one) for multiobjective optimization\nproblems is the central object of study. In this paper, we prove several lower\nbounds for the expected number of Pareto optima. Our basic result is a lower\nbound of \\Omega_d(n^(d-1)) for optimization problems with d objectives and n\nvariables under fairly general conditions on the distributions of the linear\nobjectives. Our proof relates the problem of lower bounding the number of\nPareto optima to results in geometry connected to arrangements of hyperplanes.\nWe use our basic result to derive (1) To our knowledge, the first lower bound\nfor natural multiobjective optimization problems. We illustrate this for the\nmaximum spanning tree problem with randomly chosen edge weights. Our technique\nis sufficiently flexible to yield such lower bounds for other standard\nobjective functions studied in this setting (such as, multiobjective shortest\npath, TSP tour, matching).

One of the main features of our constructions is\nthat they are \\emph{fully de-amortized}, meaning that their performance bounds\nhold without one having to tune their constructions with certain performance\nparameters, such as the constant factors in the exponents of failure\nprobabilities or, in the case of the external-memory model, the size of blocks\nor cache lines and the size of internal memory (i.e., our external-memory\nalgorithms are cache oblivious). Our solutions are based on a fully\nde-amortized implementation of cuckoo hashing, which may be of independent\ninterest. This hashing scheme uses two cuckoo hash tables, one \"nested\" inside\nthe other, with one serving as a primary structure and the other serving as an\nauxiliary supporting queue/stash structure that is super-sized with respect to\ntraditional auxiliary structures but nevertheless adds negligible storage to\nour scheme.

It can also be used to\ncompute f^k(i), for any negative integer k, in optimal O(1+|f^k(i)|) time.\n  We place emphasis on the redundancy, or the space beyond the\ninformation-theoretic lower bound that the data structure uses in order to\nsupport operations efficiently. A number of lower bounds have recently been\nshown on the redundancy of data structures. These lower bounds confirm the\nspace-time optimality of some of our solutions. Furthermore, the redundancy of\none of our structures \"surpasses\" a recent lower bound by Golynski [Golynski,\nSODA 2009], thus demonstrating the limitations of this lower bound.",

In addition to the\ntraditional version assuming a buffer of fixed capacity, a relaxed version is\nalso considered, in which buffer occupancy can vary and its average is\nconstrained. Resorting to multiobjective optimization, viewing occupancy as a\ncost rather than as a constraint, the optimal eviction policy is obtained by\ncomposing solutions for the individual addressable items.\n  This approach is then specialized to the Least Recently Used Stack Model\n(LRUSM), a type of HMRM often considered for traces, which includes V-1\nparameters, where V is the size of the virtual space.

The \\maxbisection problem is a variant of \\maxcut with an\nadditional global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the\nvertices, i.e., $|S| = |V|/2$. Several other natural optimization problems like\n\\minbisection and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with\nglobal constraints.\n  In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with\nglobal constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we\npresent the following results:\n  Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time\n$O(n^{poly(1/\\epsilon)})$ that given an instance of \\maxbisection with value\n$1-\\epsilon$, finds a bisection with value $1-O(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$.

    "summary": "In a software watermarking environment, several graph theoretic watermark\nmethods use numbers as watermark values, where some of these methods encode the\nwatermark numbers as graph structures. In this paper we extended the class of\nerror correcting graphs by proposing an efficient and easily implemented codec\nsystem for encoding watermark numbers as reducible permutation flow-graphs.\nMore precisely, we first present an efficient algorithm which encodes a\nwatermark number $w$ as self-inverting permutation $\\pi^*$ and, then, an\nalgorithm which encodes the self-inverting permutation $\\pi^*$ as a reducible\npermutation flow-graph $F[\\pi^*]$ by exploiting domination relations on the\nelements of $\\pi^*$ and using an efficient DAG representation of $\\pi^*$. The\nwhole encoding process takes O(n) time and space, where $n$ is the binary size\nof the number $w$ or, equivalently, the number of elements of the permutation\n$\\pi^*$. We also propose efficient decoding algorithms which extract the number\n$w$ from the reducible permutation flow-graph $F[\\pi^*]$ within the same time\nand space complexity. The two main components of our proposed codec system,\ni.e., the self-inverting permutation $\\pi^*$ and the reducible permutation\ngraph $F[\\pi^*]$, incorporate important structural properties which make our\nsystem resilient to attacks.",

In such case we would like to release a low rank\napproximation that satisfies a strong privacy guarantee such as differential\nprivacy.

    "summary": "Makespan minimization on identical parallel machines is a classical\nscheduling problem. We consider the online scenario where a sequence of $n$\njobs has to be scheduled non-preemptively on $m$ machines so as to minimize the\nmaximum completion time of any job. The best competitive ratio that can be\nachieved by deterministic online algorithms is in the range $[1.88,1.9201]$.\nCurrently no randomized online algorithm with a smaller competitiveness is\nknown, for general $m$.\n  In this paper we explore the power of job migration, i.e.\\ an online\nscheduler is allowed to perform a limited number of job reassignments.\nMigration is a common technique used in theory and practice to balance load in\nparallel processing environments. As our main result we settle the performance\nthat can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms. We develop an\nalgorithm that is $\\alpha_m$-competitive, for any $m\\geq 2$, where $\\alpha_m$\nis the solution of a certain equation.

We complement this\nresult by a matching lower bound: No online algorithm that uses $o(n)$ job\nmigrations can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than $\\alpha_m$. We finally\ntrade performance for migrations. We give a family of algorithms that is\n$c$-competitive, for any $5/3\\leq c \\leq 2$. For $c= 5/3$, the strategy uses at\nmost $4m$ job migrations.

    "summary": "One of the motivations for property testing of boolean functions is the idea\nthat testing can serve as a preprocessing step before learning. However, in\nmost machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of\nfictitious examples constructed by the algorithm. Instead, the dominant query\nparadigm in applied machine learning, called active learning, is one where the\nalgorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given polynomial-sized\n(unlabeled) sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we\nbring this well-studied model in learning to the domain of testing.\n  We show that for a number of important properties, testing can still yield\nsubstantial benefits in this setting. This includes testing unions of\nintervals, testing linear separators, and testing various assumptions used in\nsemi-supervised learning. In addition to these specific results, we also\ndevelop a general notion of the testing dimension of a given property with\nrespect to a given distribution. We show this dimension characterizes (up to\nconstant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that\nproperty. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing\nmodels. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds,\nincluding for linear separators and the class of dictator functions.\n  Our results show that testing can be a powerful tool in realistic models for\nlearning, and further that active testing exhibits an interesting and rich\nstructure. Our work in addition brings together tools from a range of areas\nincluding U-statistics, noise-sensitivity, self-correction, and spectral\nanalysis of random matrices, and develops new tools that may be of independent\ninterest.",

In this work, we present\nsemi-streaming algorithms that perform one or two passes over the input stream\nfor maximum matching with no restrictions on the input graph, and for the\nimportant special case of bipartite graphs that we refer to as maximum\nbipartite matching (MBM). The Greedy matching algorithm performs one pass over\nthe input and outputs a $1/2$ approximation.

The main contribution is an\nalmost linear time algorithm computing the terminal strongly connected\ncomponents (i.e. SCCs which do not reach any components but themselves).\n\"Almost linear\" here means that the complexity of the algorithm is linear in\nthe size of the hypergraph up to a factor alpha(n), where alpha is the inverse\nof Ackermann function, and n is the number of vertices. Our motivation to study\nthis problem arises from a recent application of directed hypergraphs to\ncomputational tropical geometry.\n  We also discuss the problem of computing all SCCs. We establish a superlinear\nlower bound on the size of the transitive reduction of the reachability\nrelation in directed hypergraphs, showing that it is combinatorially more\ncomplex than in directed graphs. Besides, we prove a linear time reduction from\nthe well-studied problem of finding all minimal sets among a given family to\nthe problem of computing the SCCs. Only subquadratic time algorithms are known\nfor the former problem. These results strongly suggest that the problem of\ncomputing the SCCs is harder in directed hypergraphs than in directed graphs.",

    "summary": "Clustering a graph means identifying internally dense subgraphs which are\nonly sparsely interconnected. Formalizations of this notion lead to measures\nthat quantify the quality of a clustering and to algorithms that actually find\nclusterings.

In this work we conduct a\ncomprehensive experimental evaluation of the qualitative behavior of greedy\nbottom-up heuristics driven by cut-based objectives and constrained by\nintracluster density, using both real-world data and artificial instances. Our\nstudy documents that a greedy strategy based on local movement is superior to\none based on merging. We further reveal that the former approach generally\noutperforms alternative setups and reference algorithms from the literature in\nterms of its own objective, while a modularity-based algorithm competes\nsurprisingly well. Finally, we exhibit which combinations of cut-based inter-\nand intracluster measures are suitable for identifying a hidden reference\nclustering in synthetic random graphs.",

Here $\\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th smallest generalized\neigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of cost and demand graphs; $C(T,V\\setminus\nT)$ (resp. $D(T,V\\setminus T)$) is the weight of edges crossing the\n$(T,V\\setminus T)$ cut in cost (resp. demand) graph and $\\Phi^*$ is the\nsparsity of the optimal cut. In words, we show that the non-uniform sparsest\ncut problem is easy when the generalized spectrum grows moderately fast. To the\nbest of our knowledge, there were no results based on higher order spectra for\nnon-uniform sparsest cut prior to this work.\n  Even for uniform sparsest cut, the quantitative aspects of our result are\nsomewhat stronger than previous methods. Similar results hold for other\nexpansion measures like edge expansion, normalized cut, and conductance, with\nthe $r$'th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian playing the role of\n$\\lambda_r$ in the latter two cases.\n  Our proof is based on an l1-embedding of vectors from a semi-definite program\nfrom the Lasserre hierarchy. The embedded vectors are then rounded to a cut\nusing standard threshold rounding. We hope that the ideas connecting\n$\\ell_1$-embeddings to Lasserre SDPs will find other applications. Another\naspect of the analysis is the adaptation of the column selection paradigm from\nour earlier work on rounding Lasserre SDPs [GS11] to pick a set of edges rather\nthan vertices. This feature is important in order to extend the algorithms to\nnon-uniform sparsest cut.",

    "summary": "Domains like bioinformatics, version control systems, collaborative editing\nsystems (wiki), and others, are producing huge data collections that are very\nrepetitive. That is, there are few differences between the elements of the\ncollection. This fact makes the compressibility of the collection extremely\nhigh. For example, a collection with all different versions of a Wikipedia\narticle can be compressed up to the 0.1% of its original space, using the\nLempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) compression scheme.\n  Many of these repetitive collections handle huge amounts of text data. For\nthat reason, we require a method to store them efficiently, while providing the\nability to operate on them. The most common operations are the extraction of\nrandom portions of the collection and the search for all the occurrences of a\ngiven pattern inside the whole collection.\n  A self-index is a data structure that stores a text in compressed form and\nallows to find the occurrences of a pattern efficiently. On the other hand,\nself-indexes can extract any substring of the collection, hence they are able\nto replace the original text. One of the main goals when using these indexes is\nto store them within main memory.\n  In this thesis we present a scheme for random text extraction from text\ncompressed with a Lempel-Ziv parsing. Additionally, we present a variant of\nLZ77, called LZ-End, that efficiently extracts text using space close to that\nof LZ77.\n  The main contribution of this thesis is the first self-index based on\nLZ77/LZ-End and oriented to repetitive texts, which outperforms the state of\nthe art (the RLCSA self-index) in many aspects. Finally, we present a corpus of\nrepetitive texts, coming from several application domains.

We show:\n  * An O(k log n)-time randomized algorithm for the case where the input signal\nhas at most k non-zero Fourier coefficients, and\n  * An O(k log n log(n/k))-time randomized algorithm for general input signals.\n  Both algorithms achieve o(n log n) time, and thus improve over the Fast\nFourier Transform, for any k = o(n). They are the first known algorithms that\nsatisfy this property. Also, if one assumes that the Fast Fourier Transform is\noptimal, the algorithm for the exactly k-sparse case is optimal for any k =\nn^{\\Omega(1)}.\n  We complement our algorithmic results by showing that any algorithm for\ncomputing the sparse Fourier transform of a general signal must use at least\n\\Omega(k log(n/k)/ log log n) signal samples, even if it is allowed to perform\nadaptive sampling.",

This is one of the most prominent objective functions that have\nbeen studied with respect to clustering.\n  $D^2$-sampling \\cite{ArthurV07} is a simple non-uniform sampling technique\nfor choosing points from a set of points. It works as follows: given a set of\npoints $P \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$, the first point is chosen uniformly at\nrandom from $P$. Subsequently, a point from $P$ is chosen as the next sample\nwith probability proportional to the square of the distance of this point to\nthe nearest previously sampled points.\n  $D^2$-sampling has been shown to have nice properties with respect to the\n$k$-means clustering problem.

    "summary": "A central problem in e-commerce is determining overlapping communities among\nindividuals or objects in the absence of external identification or tagging. We\naddress this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of\ncommunities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their\nmembers. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set\nof elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other\nelements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping)\ncommunities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community\ncollectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these\ncommunities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are\n\"self-determined\" or \"self-certified\" by its members.\n  We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined\ncommunities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a\npolynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we\nobtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that\ncan find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community.\n  Social networks fit particularly naturally within the affinity system\nframework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively\nsparse yet rich information from social networks, our analysis then yields a\nset of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in\nsocial networks. In the context of social networks we also connect our analysis\nwith results about $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-clusters introduced by Mishra, Schreiber,\nStanton, and Tarjan \\cite{msst}. In contrast with the polynomial bound we prove\non the number of communities in the affinity system model, we show that there\nexists a family of networks with superpolynomial number of\n$(\\alpha,\\beta)$-clusters.",

    "summary": "In the reordering buffer management problem (RBM) a sequence of $n$ colored\nitems enters a buffer with limited capacity $k$. When the buffer is full, one\nitem is removed to the output sequence, making room for the next input item.\nThis step is repeated until the input sequence is exhausted and the buffer is\nempty. The objective is to find a sequence of removals that minimizes the total\nnumber of color changes in the output sequence. The problem formalizes numerous\napplications in computer and production systems, and is known to be NP-hard.\n  We give the first constant factor approximation guarantee for RBM. Our\nalgorithm is based on an intricate \"rounding\" of the solution to an LP\nrelaxation for RBM, so it also establishes a constant upper bound on the\nintegrality gap of this relaxation. Our results improve upon the best previous\nbound of $O(\\sqrt{\\log k})$ of Adamaszek et al. (STOC 2011) that used different\nmethods and gave an online algorithm. Our constant factor approximation beats\nthe super-constant lower bounds on the competitive ratio given by Adamaszek et\nal.

Each\n3-orientation gives rise to a unique edge coloring known as a Schnyder wood\nthat has proven powerful for various computing and combinatorics applications.\nWe consider natural Markov chains for sampling uniformly from the set of\n3-orientations. First, we study a \"triangle-reversing\" chain on the space of\n3-orientations of a fixed triangulation that reverses the orientation of the\nedges around a triangle in each move. It was shown previously that this chain\nconnects the state space and we show that (i) when restricted to planar\ntriangulations of maximum degree six, the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, and\n(ii) there exists a triangulation with high degree on which this Markov chain\nmixes slowly. Next, we consider an \"edge-flipping\" chain on the larger state\nspace consisting of 3-orientations of all planar triangulations on a fixed\nnumber of vertices. It was also shown previously that this chain connects the\nstate space and we prove that the chain is always rapidly mixing. The\ntriangle-reversing and edge-flipping Markov chains both arise in the context of\nsampling other combinatorial structures, such as Eulerian orientations and\ntriangulations of planar point sets, so our results here may shed light on the\nmixing rate of these related chains as well.",

    "summary": "A large fraction of online display advertising is sold via guaranteed\ncontracts: a publisher guarantees to the advertiser a certain number of user\nvisits satisfying the targeting predicates of the contract. The publisher is\nthen tasked with solving the ad serving problem - given a user visit, which of\nthe thousands of matching contracts should be displayed, so that by the\nexpiration time every contract has obtained the requisite number of user\nvisits. The challenges of the problem come from (1) the sheer size of the\nproblem being solved, with tens of thousands of contracts and billions of user\nvisits, (2) the unpredictability of user behavior, since these contracts are\nsold months ahead of time, when only a forecast of user visits is available and\n(3) the minute amount of resources available online, as an ad server must\nrespond with a matching contract in a fraction of a second.\n  We present a solution to the guaranteed delivery ad serving problem using\n{\\em compact allocation plans}. These plans, computed offline, can be\nefficiently queried by the ad server during an ad call; they are small, using\nonly O(1) space for contract; and are stateless, allowing for distributed\nserving without any central coordination. We evaluate this approach on a real\nset of user visits and guaranteed contracts and show that the compact\nallocation plans are an effective way of solving the guaranteed delivery ad\nserving problem.",

The optimization\nmethod we develop is scalable, with a small in-memory footprint, and working in\nlinear time per iteration. It is also \"stop-anytime\", meaning that\ntime-critical applications can stop early and still get a good serving\nsolution.

    "summary": "Motivated by applications in energy-efficient scheduling in data centers,\nKhuller, Li, and Saha introduced the {\\em machine activation} problem as a\ngeneralization of the classical optimization problems of set cover and load\nbalancing on unrelated machines. In this problem, a set of $n$ jobs have to be\ndistributed among a set of $m$ (unrelated) machines, given the processing time\nof each job on each machine, where each machine has a startup cost. The goal is\nto produce a schedule of minimum total startup cost subject to a constraint\n$\\bf L$ on its makespan. While Khuller {\\em et al} considered the offline\nversion of this problem, a typical scenario in scheduling is one where jobs\narrive online and have to be assigned to a machine immediately on arrival. We\ngive an $(O(\\log (mn)\\log m), O(\\log m))$-competitive randomized online\nalgorithm for this problem, i.e. the schedule produced by our algorithm has a\nmakespan of $O({\\bf L} \\log m)$ with high probability, and a total expected\nstartup cost of $O(\\log (mn)\\log m)$ times that of an optimal offline schedule\nwith makespan $\\bf L$. The competitive ratios of our algorithm are (almost)\noptimal.\n  Our algorithms use the online primal dual framework introduced by Alon {\\em\net al} for the online set cover problem, and subsequently developed further by\nBuchbinder, Naor, and co-authors. To the best of our knowledge, all previous\napplications of this framework have been to linear programs (LPs) with either\npacking or covering constraints. One novelty of our application is that we use\nthis framework for a mixed LP that has both covering and packing constraints.\nWe hope that the algorithmic techniques developed in this paper to\nsimultaneously handle packing and covering constraints will be useful for\nsolving other online optimization problems as well.",

    "summary": "In many problems, the inputs arrive over time, and must be dealt with\nirrevocably when they arrive. Such problems are online problems. A common\nmethod of solving online problems is to first solve the corresponding linear\nprogram, and then round the fractional solution online to obtain an integral\nsolution.\n  We give algorithms for solving linear programs with mixed packing and\ncovering constraints online. We first consider mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs, where packing constraints are given offline and covering\nconstraints are received online. The objective is to minimize the maximum\nmultiplicative factor by which any packing constraint is violated, while\nsatisfying the covering constraints. No prior sublinear competitive algorithms\nare known for this problem. We give the first such --- a\npolylogarithmic-competitive algorithm for solving mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs online. We also show a nearly tight lower bound.\n  Our techniques for the upper bound use an exponential penalty function in\nconjunction with multiplicative updates. While exponential penalty functions\nare used previously to solve linear programs offline approximately, offline\nalgorithms know the constraints beforehand and can optimize greedily. In\ncontrast, when constraints arrive online, updates need to be more complex.\n  We apply our techniques to solve two online fixed-charge problems with\ncongestion. These problems are motivated by applications in machine scheduling\nand facility location. The linear program for these problems is more\ncomplicated than mixed packing and covering, and presents unique challenges. We\nshow that our techniques combined with a randomized rounding procedure give\npolylogarithmic-competitive integral solutions. These problems generalize\nonline set-cover, for which there is a polylogarithmic lower bound. Hence, our\nresults are close to tight.",

    "summary": "Many emerging computer applications require the processing of large numbers,\nlarger than what a CPU can handle. In fact, the top of the line PCs can only\nmanipulate numbers not longer than 32 bits or 64 bits. This is due to the size\nof the registers and the data-path inside the CPU. As a result, performing\narithmetic operations such as subtraction on big-integer numbers is to some\nextend limited. Different algorithms were designed in an attempt to solve this\nproblem; they all operate on big-integer numbers by first converting them into\na binary representation then performing bitwise operations on single bits. Such\nalgorithms are of complexity O(n) where n is the total number of bits in each\noperand. This paper proposes two new algorithms for performing arithmetic\nsubtraction on big-integer numbers. The two algorithms are different in that\none is sequential while the other is parallel. The similarity between them is\nthat both follow the same concept of dividing the big-integer inputs into\nseveral blocks or tokens of 60 bits (18 digits) each; thus reducing the input\nsize n in O(n) by a factor of 60. Subtraction of corresponding tokens, one from\neach operand, is performed as humans perform subtraction, using a pencil and a\npaper in the decimal system. Both algorithms are to be implemented using MS\nC#.NET 2005 and tested over a multiple processor system.

    "summary": "Spectral partitioning is a simple, nearly-linear time, algorithm to find\nsparse cuts, and the Cheeger inequalities provide a worst-case guarantee for\nthe quality of the approximation found by the algorithm. Local graph\npartitioning algorithms [ST08,ACL06,AP09] run in time that is nearly linear in\nthe size of the output set, and their approximation guarantee is worse than the\nguarantee provided by the Cheeger inequalities by a polylogarithmic\n$\\log^{\\Omega(1)} n$ factor. It has been a long standing open problem to design\na local graph clustering algorithm with an approximation guarantee close to the\nguarantee of the Cheeger inequalities and with a running time nearly linear in\nthe size of the output.\n  In this paper we solve this problem; we design an algorithm with the same\nguarantee (up to a constant factor) as the Cheeger inequality, that runs in\ntime slightly super linear in the size of the output. This is the first\nsublinear (in the size of the input) time algorithm with almost the same\nguarantee as the Cheeger's inequality. As a byproduct of our results, we prove\na bicriteria approximation algorithm for the expansion profile of any graph.\nLet $\\phi(\\gamma) = \\min_{\\mu(S) \\leq \\gamma}\\phi(S)$. There is a polynomial\ntime algorithm that, for any $\\gamma,\\epsilon>0$, finds a set $S$ of measure\n$\\mu(S)\\leq 2\\gamma^{1+\\epsilon}$, and expansion $\\phi(S)\\leq\n\\sqrt{2\\phi(\\gamma)/\\epsilon}$. Our proof techniques also provide a simpler\nproof of the structural result of Arora, Barak, Steurer [ABS10], that can be\napplied to irregular graphs.\n  Our main technical tool is that for any set $S$ of vertices of a graph, a\nlazy $t$-step random walk started from a randomly chosen vertex of $S$, will\nremain entirely inside $S$ with probability at least $(1-\\phi(S)/2)^t$.

    "summary": "The graph exploration problem is to visit all the nodes of a connected graph\nby a mobile entity, e.g., a robot. The robot has no a priori knowledge of the\ntopology of the graph or of its size. Cohen et al. \\cite{Ilcinkas08} introduced\nlabel guided graph exploration which allows the system designer to add short\nlabels to the graph nodes in a preprocessing stage; these labels can guide the\nrobot in the exploration of the graph. In this paper, we address the problem of\nadjustable 1-bit label guided graph exploration. We focus on the labeling\nschemes that not only enable a robot to explore the graph but also allow the\nsystem designer to adjust the ratio of the number of different labels. This\nflexibility is necessary when maintaining different labels may have different\ncosts or when the ratio is pre-specified. We present 1-bit labeling (two\ncolors, namely black and white) schemes for this problem along with a labeling\nalgorithm for generating the required labels.

In this\nmodel there is a fixed underlying planar graph, where each edge and vertex is\neither \"off\" (failed) or \"on\" (recovered).

The model has two natural variants,\none in which there are $d$ edge/vertex failures that precede all connectivity\nqueries, and one in which failures/recoveries and queries are intermixed.\n  We present a $d$-failure connectivity oracle for planar graphs that processes\nany $d$ edge/vertex failures in $sort(d,n)$ time so that connectivity queries\ncan be answered in $pred(d,n)$ time. (Here $sort$ and $pred$ are the time for\ninteger sorting and integer predecessor search over a subset of $[n]$ of size\n$d$.) Our algorithm has two discrete parts.

Compared to the\ncontinuous greedy algorithm (Calinescu, Chekuri, Pal and Vondrak, 2008), our\nalgorithm is extremely simple and requires no rounding. It consists of the\ngreedy algorithm followed by local search. Both phases are run not on the\nactual objective function, but on a related non-oblivious potential function,\nwhich is also monotone submodular. Our algorithm runs in randomized time\nO(n^8u), where n is the rank of the given matroid and u is the size of its\nground set. We additionally obtain a 1-1/e-eps approximation algorithm running\nin randomized time O (eps^-3n^4u). For matroids in which n = o(u), this\nimproves on the runtime of the continuous greedy algorithm. The improvement is\ndue primarily to the time required by the pipage rounding phase, which we avoid\naltogether. Furthermore, the independence of our algorithm from pipage rounding\ntechniques suggests that our general approach may be helpful in contexts such\nas monotone submodular maximization subject to multiple matroid constraints.\n  Our approach generalizes to the case where the monotone submodular function\nhas restricted curvature. For any curvature c, we adapt our algorithm to\nproduce a (1-e^-c)/c approximation.

    "summary": "The selection problem, where one wishes to locate the $k^{th}$ smallest\nelement in an unsorted array of size $n$, is one of the basic problems studied\nin computer science. The main focus of this work is designing algorithms for\nsolving the selection problem in the presence of memory faults. These can\nhappen as the result of cosmic rays, alpha particles, or hardware failures.\n  Specifically, the computational model assumed here is a faulty variant of the\nRAM model (abbreviated as FRAM), which was introduced by Finocchi and Italiano.\nIn this model, the content of memory cells might get corrupted adversarially\nduring the execution, and the algorithm is given an upper bound $\\delta$ on the\nnumber of corruptions that may occur.\n  The main contribution of this work is a deterministic resilient selection\nalgorithm with optimal O(n) worst-case running time. Interestingly, the running\ntime does not depend on the number of faults, and the algorithm does not need\nto know $\\delta$.\n  The aforementioned resilient selection algorithm can be used to improve the\ncomplexity bounds for resilient $k$-d trees developed by Gieseke, Moruz and\nVahrenhold. Specifically, the time complexity for constructing a $k$-d tree is\nimproved from $O(n\\log^2 n + \\delta^2)$ to $O(n \\log n)$.\n  Besides the deterministic algorithm, a randomized resilient selection\nalgorithm is developed, which is simpler than the deterministic one, and has\n$O(n + \\alpha)$ expected time complexity and O(1) space complexity (i.e., is\nin-place). This algorithm is used to develop the first resilient sorting\nalgorithm that is in-place and achieves optimal $O(n\\log n + \\alpha\\delta)$\nexpected running time.",

    "summary": "In the reordering buffer problem (RBP), a server is asked to process a\nsequence of requests lying in a metric space. To process a request the server\nmust move to the corresponding point in the metric. The requests can be\nprocessed slightly out of order; in particular, the server has a buffer of\ncapacity k which can store up to k requests as it reads in the sequence. The\ngoal is to reorder the requests in such a manner that the buffer constraint is\nsatisfied and the total travel cost of the server is minimized. The RBP arises\nin many applications that require scheduling with a limited buffer capacity,\nsuch as scheduling a disk arm in storage systems, switching colors in paint\nshops of a car manufacturing plant, and rendering 3D images in computer\ngraphics.\n  We study the offline version of RBP and develop bicriteria approximations.\nWhen the underlying metric is a tree, we obtain a solution of cost no more than\n9OPT using a buffer of capacity 4k + 1 where OPT is the cost of an optimal\nsolution with buffer capacity k. Constant factor approximations were known\npreviously only for the uniform metric (Avigdor-Elgrabli et al., 2012). Via\nrandomized tree embeddings, this implies an O(log n) approximation to cost and\nO(1) approximation to buffer size for general metrics.

In\nparticular, if $p$ is represented with $O(\\log n)$-bit accuracy, then, with\nhigh probability, the running time is linear in the expected number of edges of\nthe output graph (up to poly-logarithmic factors). All our running times\ninclude the complexity of the arithmetic involved in the corresponding\nalgorithms. Previous standard methods for exact $G(n,p)$ sampling (see e.g.\nBatagelj and Brandes, 2005) achieve similar running times, however, under the\nassumption that performing real number arithmetic with arbitrary accuracy takes\nconstant time. We note that the actual accuracy required by these methods is\nO(n)-bit per step, which results in quadratic running times.\n  The main idea of our $G(n,p)$ generation algorithm is a Metropolis Markov\nchain to sample $\\epsilon$-close from the binomial distribution. This is a new\nmethod for sampling from the binomial distribution: it is of separate interest\nand may find other useful applications.

This may be problematic for some applications of rational\nsecret sharing such as secure multi-party computation and simulation of a\nmediator.\n  We address this issue by describing mechanisms for rational secret sharing\nthat are designed for large n. Both of our results hold for n > 2, and are Nash\nequilbria, rather than just epsilon-Nash equilbria.\n  Our first result is a mechanism for n-out-of-n rational secret sharing that\nis scalable in the sense that it requires each agent to send only an expected\nO(log n) bits. Moreover, the latency of this mechanism is O(log n) in\nexpectation, compared to O(n) expected latency for the Kol and Naor result.

Multiple facilities can be opened at any site. Each client $j$ has\na demand $r_j$, which means that it needs to be connected to $r_j$ different\nfacilities (some of which could be located on the same site). The goal is to\nminimize the sum of facility opening cost and connection cost.\n  The main result of this paper is a 1.575-approximation algorithm for FTFP,\nbased on LP-rounding. The algorithm first reduces the demands to values\npolynomial in the number of sites.

This\ngives several local load balancing algorithms which achieve the same\napproximation ratios as the online algorithms, but run in O(log n) time and\nspace.\n  Finally, we modify existing local computation algorithms for hypergraph\n2-coloring and k-CNF and use our improved analysis to obtain better time and\nspace bounds, of O(log^4 n), removing the dependency on the maximal degree of\nthe graph from the exponent.",
