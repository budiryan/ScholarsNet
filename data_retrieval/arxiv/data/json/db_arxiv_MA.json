    "summary": "We present a method for solving service allocation problems in which a set of\nservices must be allocated to a set of agents so as to maximize a global\nutility. The method is completely distributed so it can scale to any number of\nservices without degradation. We first formalize the service allocation problem\nand then present a simple hill-climbing, a global hill-climbing, and a\nbidding-protocol algorithm for solving it. We analyze the expected performance\nof these algorithms as a function of various problem parameters such as the\nbranching factor and the number of agents. Finally, we use the sensor\nallocation problem, an instance of a service allocation problem, to show the\nbidding protocol at work. The simulations also show that phase transition on\nthe expected quality of the solution exists as the amount of communication\nbetween agents increases."

    "summary": "Objective-C is still the language of choice if users want to run their\nsimulation efficiently under the Swarm environment since the Swarm environment\nitself was written in Objective-C. The language is a fast, object-oriented and\neasy to learn. However, the language is less well known than, less expressive\nthan, and lacks support for many important features of C++ (eg. OpenMP for high\nperformance computing application). In this paper, we present a methodology and\nsoftware tools that we have developed for auto generating an Objective-C object\ntemplate (and all the necessary interfacing functions) from a given C++ model,\nutilising the Classdesc's object description technology, so that the C++ model\ncan both be run and accessed under the Objective-C and C++ environments. We\nalso present a methodology for modifying an existing Swarm application to make\npart of the model (eg. the heatbug's step method) run under the C++\nenvironment."

As shown in recent studies, compromise\nmay facilitate coalition formation and increase agent utilities. In this study\nwe leverage on those new results. We devise a novel coalition formation\nmechanism that enhances compromise. Our mechanism can utilize information on\ntask dependencies to reduce formation complexity. Further, it works well with\nboth cardinal and ordinal task values. Via experiments we show that the use of\nthe suggested compromise-based coalition formation mechanism provides\nsignificant savings in the computation and communication complexity of\ncoalition formation. Our results also show that when information on task\ndependencies is used, the complexity of coalition formation is further reduced.\nWe demonstrate successful use of the mechanism for collaborative information\nfiltering, where agents combine linguistic rules to analyze documents'\ncontents."

    "summary": "The recent commercial launch of twin-deck Very Large Transport Aircraft\n(VLTA) such as the Airbus A380 has raised questions concerning the speed at\nwhich they may be evacuated. The abnormal height of emergency exits on the\nupper deck has led to speculation that emotional factors such as fear may lead\nto door delay, and thus play a significant role in increasing overall\nevacuation time. Full-scale evacuation tests are financially expensive and\npotentially hazardous, and systematic studies of the evacuation of VLTA are\nrare. Here we present a computationally cheap agent-based framework for the\ngeneral simulation of aircraft evacuation, and apply it to the particular case\nof the Airbus A380. In particular, we investigate the effect of door delay, and\nconclude that even a moderate average delay can lead to evacuation times that\nexceed the maximum for safety certification. The model suggests practical ways\nto minimise evacuation time, as well as providing a general framework for the\nsimulation of evacuation."

Persistence is a generalization to directed\ngraphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving\nautonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a\ndirected structure of unilateral distances constraints seeking to preserve a\nformation shape. Analogously to the powerful results about Henneberg sequences\nin minimal rigidity theory, we propose different types of directed graph\noperations allowing one to sequentially build any minimally persistent graph\n(i.e. persistent graph with a minimal number of edges for a given number of\nvertices), each intermediate graph being also minimally persistent. We also\nconsider the more generic problem of obtaining one minimally persistent graph\nfrom another, which corresponds to the on-line reorganization of an autonomous\nagent formation. We prove that we can obtain any minimally persistent formation\nfrom any other one by a sequence of elementary local operations such that\nminimal persistence is preserved throughout the reorganization process."

    "summary": "An edge-colored directed graph is \\emph{observable} if an agent that moves\nalong its edges is able to determine his position in the graph after a\nsufficiently long observation of the edge colors. When the agent is able to\ndetermine his position only from time to time, the graph is said to be\n\\emph{partly observable}. Observability in graphs is desirable in situations\nwhere autonomous agents are moving on a network and one wants to localize them\n(or the agent wants to localize himself) with limited information. In this\npaper, we completely characterize observable and partly observable graphs and\nshow how these concepts relate to observable discrete event systems and to\nlocal automata. Based on these characterizations, we provide polynomial time\nalgorithms to decide observability, to decide partial observability, and to\ncompute the minimal number of observations necessary for finding the position\nof an agent. In particular we prove that in the worst case this minimal number\nof observations increases quadratically with the number of nodes in the graph.\n  From this it follows that it may be necessary for an agent to pass through\nthe same node several times before he is finally able to determine his position\nin the graph. We then consider the more difficult question of assigning colors\nto a graph so as to make it observable and we prove that two different versions\nof this problem are NP-complete."

The trading of stocks is\nconducted by following these rules: (1) if a player expects an increase in\nprice then it tries to buy the stock; (2) else if it expects a drop in the\nprice, it sells the stock; (3)and the order in which a player participates in\nthe game is random. The proposed procedure is implemented to simulate trading\nof three stocks, namely, the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

    "summary": "A new approach of coordination of decisions in a multi site system is\nproposed. It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept and on the\nprinciple of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each\nenterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local\nand global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual\nEnterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of\ntiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner\nconstitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers.\nExchanges between the VENs ensure the autonomy of decision, and guarantiee the\nconsistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN\nagents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA)\nand one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If\nsupply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier\nNegotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain\nMediator Agent (SCMA) working at the level of the enterprise network. These two\nagents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs\nprocess the flow of information alone. With this new approach, managing\nenterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a\nsimple enterprise in the network. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows\nphysical distribution of the decisional system, and procures a heterarchical\norganization structure with a decentralized control that guaranties the\nautonomy of each entity and the flexibility of the network."

The supply chain\nis viewed as a set of tiers (corresponding to the levels of production), in\nwhich each partner of the supply chain (VEN) is in relation with several\ncustomers and suppliers. Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives\nglobal objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The Mediator\nAgent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those\nobjectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to Negotiator\nAgent at the tier level (NAT). These two agents are only active if a\nperturbation occurs; otherwise information flows are only exchange between\nVENs.

    "summary": "We study a model of opinion dynamics introduced by Krause: each agent has an\nopinion represented by a real number, and updates its opinion by averaging all\nagent opinions that differ from its own by less than 1. We give a new proof of\nconvergence into clusters of agents, with all agents in the same cluster\nholding the same opinion. We then introduce a particular notion of equilibrium\nstability and provide lower bounds on the inter-cluster distances at a stable\nequilibrium. To better understand the behavior of the system when the number of\nagents is large, we also introduce and study a variant involving a continuum of\nagents, obtaining partial convergence results and lower bounds on inter-cluster\ndistances, under some mild assumptions."

    "summary": "A common assumption in modern microeconomic theory is that choice should be\nrationalizable via a binary preference relation, which \\citeauthor{Sen71a}\nshowed to be equivalent to two consistency conditions, namely $\\alpha$\n(contraction) and $\\gamma$ (expansion). Within the context of \\emph{social}\nchoice, however, rationalizability and similar notions of consistency have\nproved to be highly problematic, as witnessed by a range of impossibility\nresults, among which Arrow's is the most prominent. Since choice functions\nselect \\emph{sets} of alternatives rather than single alternatives, we propose\nto rationalize choice functions by preference relations over sets\n(set-rationalizability). We also introduce two consistency conditions,\n$\\hat\\alpha$ and $\\hat\\gamma$, which are defined in analogy to $\\alpha$ and\n$\\gamma$, and find that a choice function is set-rationalizable if and only if\nit satisfies $\\hat\\alpha$. Moreover, a choice function satisfies $\\hat\\alpha$\nand $\\hat\\gamma$ if and only if it is \\emph{self-stable}, a new concept based\non earlier work by \\citeauthor{Dutt88a}. The class of self-stable social choice\nfunctions contains a number of appealing Condorcet extensions such as the\nminimal covering set and the essential set."

We show, however, that trust is fundamentally heuristic, as\nit provides insufficient information for agents to make a rational judgement.

    "summary": "Multi-agent systems where the agents are developed by parties with competing\ninterests, and where there is no access to an agent's internal state, are often\nclassified as `open'. The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail\nto, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification.\nConsequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist\nbetween the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power.\nThe specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a\ndesign-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification\nmodification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is\noften required to revise the specification during the system execution. To\naddress this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'\nspecifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the\nagents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a\nmodification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and\nenactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule\nmodification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by\nconsidering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore,\nwe constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation\ncriteria. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications,\nand the `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications.\nWe illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a\nresource-sharing protocol."

This design challenge is approached by the activation of agent\nmodules. Modules are converted to software elements that reason about and\nmodify their host agent. We discuss and formalize this extension within the\ncontext of a generic coordination architecture and exemplify the proposed\nprogramming model with the decentralized management of (web) service\ninfrastructures."

    "summary": "Fatal crush conditions occur in crowds with tragic frequency. Event\norganisers and architects are often criticised for failing to consider the\ncauses and implications of crush, but the reality is that the prediction and\nmitigation of such conditions offers a significant technical challenge. Full\ntreatment of physical force within crowd simulations is precise but\ncomputationally expensive; the more common method of human interpretation of\nresults is computationally \"cheap\" but subjective and time-consuming. In this\npaper we propose an alternative method for the analysis of crowd behaviour,\nwhich uses information theory to measure crowd disorder. We show how this\ntechnique may be easily incorporated into an existing simulation framework, and\nvalidate it against an historical event. Our results show that this method\noffers an effective and efficient route towards automatic detection of crush."

    "summary": "In this paper we study the problem of tracking an object moving randomly\nthrough a network of wireless sensors. Our objective is to devise strategies\nfor scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking\nperformance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the control actions\ncorrespond to the set of sensors to activate at each time step. Using a\nbottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with\nincreasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the\ndifferent sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the\nsensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping\nsensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the\ndifferent sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein\nthe target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous\nspaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models\ndue to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we\ndevise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds\non the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit\nsuboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs."

    "summary": "Since many of the currently available multi-agent frameworks are generally\nmostly intended for research, it can be difficult to built multi-agent systems\nusing physical robots. In this report I describe a way to combine the\nmulti-agent framework Jason, an extended version of the agent-oriented\nprogramming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By\nextending parts of the Jason reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to\ncomplete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able\nto avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a\nfunctional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego\nagents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the\nagents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required\nto move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning\ncycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and\ncan be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a\nmulti-agent environment."

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of \"ant robots\"\nfor covering a connected region on the Z^{2} grid, whose area is unknown in\nadvance, and which expands at a given rate, where $n$ is the initial size of\nthe connected region.\n  We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots' hardware and\nsoftware specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for\nsuch coverage to be possible is \\Omega({\\sqrt{n}}).\n  In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow\nrate, a team of \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}) robots could cover it in at most O(n^{2} \\ln\nn) time.\n  This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability\nto directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with\na memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t the size of the region (therefore, the robots\ncannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths).\n  Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the\ncurrent best known result of O(n^{2}) by demonstrating an algorithm that\nguarantees such a coverage with completion time of O(\\frac{1}{k} n^{1.5} + n)\nin the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter\nthan O(n)."

The major advantages of RGT are its ability to predict human\nbehavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind. On the\nother hand, PAD provides ultimate approach to model emotions. It is illustrated\nthat emotions are reflexive processes and, consequently, RGT fused with PAD\nmodel is natural solution to model emotional interactions between people. The\nfusion of RGT and PAD, called Emotional Reflexive Games (ERG), inherits the key\nfeatures of both components.

Each (directed) arc in the underlying communication graph is assumed\nto be associated with a time-dependent weight function which describes the\nstrength of the information flow from one node to another. An arc is said to be\npersistent if its weight function has infinite $\\mathscr{L}_1$ or $\\ell_1$ norm\nfor continuous-time or discrete-time belief evolutions, respectively. The graph\nthat consists of all persistent arcs is called the persistent graph of the\nunderlying network. Three necessary and sufficient conditions on agreement or\n$\\epsilon$-agreement are established, by which we prove that the persistent\ngraph fully determines the convergence to a common opinion in social networks.\nIt is shown how the convergence rates explicitly depend on the diameter of the\npersistent graph.

    "summary": "We consider the problem of information fusion from multiple sensors of\ndifferent types with the objective of improving the confidence of inference\ntasks, such as object classification, performed from the data collected by the\nsensors. We propose a novel technique based on distributed belief aggregation\nusing a multi-agent prediction market to solve this information fusion problem.\nTo monitor the improvement in the confidence of the object classification as\nwell as to dis-incentivize agents from misreporting information, we have\nintroduced a market maker that rewards the agents instantaneously as well as at\nthe end of the inference task, based on the quality of the submitted reports.\nWe have implemented the market maker's reward calculation in the form of a\nscoring rule and have shown analytically that it incentivizes truthful\nrevelation or accurate reporting by each agent. We have experimentally verified\nour technique for multi-sensor information fusion for an automated landmine\ndetection scenario. Our experimental results show that, for identical data\ndistributions and settings, using our information aggregation technique\nincreases the accuracy of object classification favorably as compared to two\nother commonly used techniques for information fusion for landmine detection."

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of \"ant robots\"\nfor covering a connected region on the $Z^{2}$ grid, whose area is unknown in\nadvance and which expands stochastically. Specifically, we discuss the problem\nwhere an initial connected region of $S_0$ boundary tiles expand outward with\nprobability $p$ at every time step. On this grid region a group of $k$ limited\nand simple agents operate, in order to clean the unmapped and dynamically\nexpanding region. A preliminary version of this problem was discussed in\n[1],[2] involving a deterministic expansion of a region in the grid.In this\nwork we extend the model and examine cases where the spread of the region is\ndone stochastically, where each tile has some probability $p$ to expand, at\nevery time step. For this extended model we obtain an analytic probabilistic\nlower bounds for the minimal number of agents and minimal time required to\nenable a collaborative coverage of the expanding region, regardless of the\nalgorithm used and the robots' hardware and software specifications. In\naddition, we present an impossibility result, for a variety of regions that\nwould be impossible to completely clean, regardless of the algorithm used.\nFinally, we validate the analytic bounds using extensive empirical computer\nsimulation results."

    "summary": "Since the time when concept of e-maintenance was introduced, most of the\nworks insisted on the relevance of the underlying Information and Communication\nTechnologies infrastructure. Through a review of current e-maintenance\nconceptual approaches and realizations, this paper aims to reconsider the\npredominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature. The review\nbrings to light the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of\ne-maintenance that is to be led in a holistic predefined manner rather than\nisolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. As a contribution towards an\nintelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework, a proposal is outlined\nin this paper to model e-maintenance system as an intelligent system. The\nproposed frame is based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Within\nthe proposed frame, more importance was reserved to the environment that the\nsystem is to be continuously aware of: Plant Environment, Internal and External\nEnterprise Environment and Human Environment. In addition to the abilities\nrequired for internal coherent behavior of the system, requirements for\nmaintenance activities support are also mapped within the same frame according\nto corresponding levels of management. A case study was detailed in this paper\nsustaining the applicability of the proposal in relation to the classification\nof existing e-maintenance platforms. However, more work is needed to enhance\nexhaustiveness of the frame to serve as a comparison tool of existing\ne-maintenance systems. At the conceptual level, our future work is to use the\nproposed frame in an e-maintenance project."

    "summary": "Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is\nimportant when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. Not only\nmicro-simulation and agent-based model such as UrbanSim, ILUMAS and SIMFIRMS,\nbut also Simon's model of hierarchical concentration have widely applied, for\nthis purpose. These models, however, have limitations with respect to\nsimulating structural changes in spatial economic systems and the impact of\nproximity. The present paper proposes a model of firm development that is based\non behavioural rules such as growth, closure, spin-off and relocation. An\nimportant aspect of the model is that locational preferences of firms are based\non agglomeration advantages, accessibility of markets and congestion, allowing\nfor a proper description of concentration and deconcentration tendencies. By\ncomparing the outcomes of the proposed model with real world data, we will\ncalibrate the parameters and assess how well the model predicts existing\nspatial configurations and decide. The model is implemented as an agent-based\nsimulation model describing firm development in the Netherlands in 21\nindustrial sectors from 1950 to 2004."

    "summary": "Consensus strategies find a variety of applications in distributed\ncoordination and decision making in multi-agent systems. In particular, average\nconsensus plays a key role in a number of applications and is closely\nassociated with two classes of digraphs, weight-balanced (for continuous-time\nsystems) and bistochastic (for discrete-time systems). A weighted digraph is\ncalled balanced if, for each node, the sum of the weights of the edges outgoing\nfrom that node is equal to the sum of the weights of the edges incoming to that\nnode. In addition, a weight-balanced digraph is bistochastic if all weights are\nnonnegative and, for each node, the sum of weights of edges incoming to that\nnode and the sum of the weights of edges out-going from that node is unity;\nthis implies that the corresponding weight matrix is column and row stochastic\n(i.e., doubly stochastic). We propose two distributed algorithms: one solves\nthe weight-balance problem and the other solves the bistochastic matrix\nformation problem for a distributed system whose components (nodes) can\nexchange information via interconnection links (edges) that form an arbitrary,\npossibly directed, strongly connected communication topology (digraph). Both\ndistributed algorithms achieve their goals asymptotically and operate\niteratively by having each node adapt the (nonnegative) weights on its outgoing\nedges based on the weights of its incoming links (i.e., based on purely local\ninformation). We also provide examples to illustrate the operation,\nperformance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithms."

Their importance is considerable when it comes to\nguarantee safety and protection during a crisis. However, sometimes\ndiscrepancies arise between the goals of the plan and its outcomes, because\npeople find it hard to take them very seriously, or due to the financial and\ntime resources required. Serious games are a possible solution to tackle this\nproblem. They have been successfully applied in different areas such as health\ncare and education, since they can simulate an environment/task quite\naccurately, making them a practical alternative to real-life simulations. This\npaper presents a serious game developed using Unity3D to recreate a virtual\nfire evacuation training tool. The prototype application was deployed which\nallowed the validation by user testing. A sample of 30 individuals tested the\nevacuating scenario, having to leave the building during a fire in the shortest\ntime possible. Results have shown that users effectively end up learning some\nevacuation procedures from the activity, even if only to look for emergency\nsigns indicating the best evacuation paths. It was also evidenced that users\nwith higher video game experience had a significantly better performance."

    "summary": "Agent mediated e-commerce involves buying and selling on Internet through\nsoftware agents. The success of an agent mediated e-commerce system lies in the\nunderlying reputation management system which is used to improve the quality of\nservices in e-market environment. A reputation system encourages the honest\nbehaviour of seller agents and discourages the malicious behaviour of dishonest\nseller agents in the e-market where actual traders never meet each other. This\npaper evaluates various reputation systems for assigning reputation rating to\nsoftware agents acting on behalf of buyers and sellers in e-market. These\nmodels are analysed on the basis of a number of features viz. reputation\ncomputation and their defence mechanisms against different attacks. To address\nthe problems of traditional reputation systems which are relatively static in\nnature, this paper identifies characteristics of a dynamic reputation framework\nwhich ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation\nand also associates the reputation of an agent with the value of a transaction\nso that the market approaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are\nweeded out of the market."

    "summary": "This paper investigates agreement protocols over cooperative and\ncooperative--antagonistic multi-agent networks with coupled continuous-time\nnonlinear dynamics. To guarantee convergence for such systems, it is common in\nthe literature to assume that the vector field of each agent is pointing inside\nthe convex hull formed by the states of the agent and its neighbors, given that\nthe relative states between each agent and its neighbors are available. This\nconvexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that\nthe vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting\nhyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of\nrequiring shared reference directions in addition to the available local\nrelative states. Such shared reference directions can be further interpreted as\nif each agent holds a magnetic compass indicating the orientations of a global\nframe. It is proven that the cooperative multi-agent system achieves\nexponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying interaction graph\nis uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. Cooperative--antagonistic\nmulti-agent systems are also considered. For these systems, the relation has a\nnegative sign for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State\nagreement may not be achieved, but instead it is shown that all the agents'\nstates asymptotically converge, and their limits agree componentwise in\nabsolute values if and in general only if the time-varying interaction graph is\nuniformly jointly strongly connected."

    "summary": "In this paper, we address the problems faced by a group of agents that\npossess situational awareness, but lack a security mechanism, by the\nintroduction of a adaptive risk management system. The Belief-Desire-Intention\n(BDI) architecture lacks a framework that would facilitate an adaptive risk\nmanagement system that uses the situational awareness of the agents. We extend\nthe BDI architecture with the concept of adaptive alertness. Agents can modify\ntheir level of alertness by monitoring the risks faced by them and by their\npeers. Alert-BDI enables the agents to detect and assess the risks faced by\nthem in an efficient manner, thereby increasing operational efficiency and\nresistance against attacks."

    "summary": "Pedestrian behavior has much more complicated characteristics in a dense\ncrowd and thus attracts the widespread interest of scientists and engineers.\nHowever, even successful modeling approaches such as pedestrian models based on\nparticle systems are still not fully considered the perceptive mechanism\nunderlying collective pedestrian behavior. This paper extends a behavioral\nheuristics-based pedestrian model to an adaptive agent-based model, which\nexplicitly considers the crowding effect of neighboring individuals and\nperception anisotropy on the representation of a pedestrians visual\ninformation. The adaptive agents with crowding perception are constructed to\ninvestigate complex, selforganized collective dynamics of pedestrian motion.\nThe proposed model simulates selforganized pedestrian flows in good\nquantitative agreement with empirical data. The selforganized phenomena include\nlane formation in bidirectional flow and fundamental diagrams of unidirectional\nflow. Simulation results show that the emergence of lane formation in\nbidirectional flow can be well reproduced. To investigate this further,\nincreasing view distance has a significant effect on reducing the number of\nlanes, increasing lane width, and stabilizing the self-organized lanes. The\npaper also discusses phase transitions of fundamental diagrams of pedestrian\ncrowds with unidirectional flow. It is found that the heterogeneity of how\npedestrians perceive crowding in the population has a remarkable impact on the\nflow quality, which results in the buildup of congestion and rapidly decreases\nthe efficiency of pedestrian flows. It also indicates that the concept of\nheterogeneity may be used to explain the instability of phase transitions."

    "summary": "With the proliferation of web technologies it becomes more and more important\nto make the traditional negotiation pricing mechanism automated and\nintelligent. The behaviour of software agents which negotiate on behalf of\nhumans is determined by their tactics in the form of decision functions.\nPrediction of partners behaviour in negotiation has been an active research\ndirection in recent years as it will improve the utility gain for the adaptive\nnegotiation agent and also achieve the agreement much quicker or look after\nmuch higher benefits. In this paper we review the various negotiation methods\nand the existing architecture. Although negotiation is practically very complex\nactivity to automate without human intervention we have proposed architecture\nfor predicting the opponents behaviour which will take into consideration\nvarious factors which affect the process of negotiation. The basic concept is\nthat the information about negotiators, their individual actions and dynamics\ncan be used by software agents equipped with adaptive capabilities to learn\nfrom past negotiations and assist in selecting appropriate negotiation tactics."

We propose a Negotiation system using\ncloud. In this system, all product information and multiple agent details are\nstored on cloud. Both parties select their agents through cloud for\nnegotiation. Agent acts as a negotiator. Agents have users details and their\nrequirements for a particular product. Using users requirement, agents\nnegotiate on some issues such as price, volume, duration, quality and so on.\nAfter completing negotiation process, agents give feedback to the user about\nwhether negotiation is successful or not. This negotiation system is dynamic in\nnature and increases the agents with the increase in participating user."

    "summary": "Previous papers have described a computational approach to System of Systems\n(SoS) development using an Agent-Based Model (ABM). This paper describes the\nFuzzy Decision Analysis used in the negotiation between the SoS agent and a\nSystem agent in the ABM of an Acknowledged SoS development. An Acknowledged SoS\nhas by definition a limited influence on the development of the individual\nSystems. The individual Systems have their own priorities, pressures, and\nagenda which may or may not align with the goals of the SoS. The SoS has some\nfunding and deadlines which can be used to negotiate with the individual System\nin order to illicit the required capability from that System. The Fuzzy\nDecision Analysis determines how the SoS agent will adjust the funding and\ndeadlines for each of the Systems in order to achieve the desired SoS\narchitecture quality. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis has inputs of performance,\nfunding, and deadlines as well as weights for each capability. The performance,\nfunding, and deadlines are crisp values which are fuzzified. The fuzzified\nvalues are then used with a Fuzzy Inference Engine to get the fuzzy outputs of\nfunding adjustment and deadline adjustment which must then be defuzzified\nbefore being passed to the System agent. The first contribution of this paper\nis the fuzzy decision analysis that represents the negotiation between the SoS\nagent and the System agent. A second contribution of this paper is the method\nof implementing the fuzzy decision analysis which provides a generalized fuzzy\ndecision analysis."

In this paper, we show how multi-agent\nsystems can fulfil these requirements.

Few applied urban\nmodels can pursue large-scale extent with fine-level units simultaneously due\nto data availability and computation load. The framework of automatic\nidentification and characterization parcels developed by Long and Liu (2013)\nmakes such an ideal model possible by establishing existing urban parcels using\nroad networks and points of interest for a super large area (like a country or\na continent). In this study, a mega-vector-parcels cellular automata model\n(MVP-CA) is developed for simulating urban expansion in the parcel level for\nall 654 Chinese cities. Existing urban parcels in 2012, for initiating MVP-CA,\nare generated using multi-levelled road networks and ubiquitous points of\ninterest, followed by simulating parcel-based urban expansion of all cities\nduring 2012-2017. Reflecting national spatial development strategies discussed\nextensively by academics and decision makers, the baseline scenario and other\ntwo simulated urban expansion scenarios have been tested and compared\nhorizontally. As the first fine-scale urban expansion model from the national\nscope, its academic contributions, practical applications, and potential biases\nare discussed in this paper as well."

Mainly\nnegotiation models are based on agents' interactions through messages. Agents\ninteract in order to reach an agreement for solving a specific problem. In this\nwork, we study a new variant of negotiations, which has not yet been addressed\nin existing works. This negotiation form is denoted extensible negotiation. In\ncontrast with current negotiation models, this form of negotiation allows the\nagents to dynamically extend the set of items under negotiation. This facility\ngives more acceptable solutions for the agents in their negotiation. The\nadvantage of enlarging the negotiation space is to certainly offer more\nfacilities for the agents for reaching new agreements which would not have been\nobtained using usual negotiation methods. This paper presents the protocol and\nthe strategies used by the agents to deal with such negotiations."

These instruments\nprovide support to the organization of spaces, services and facilities and to\nthe definition of management procedures for normal and emergency situations.\nThe employment of these tools is effective for various but not for all the\ncontexts, nevertheless new features and functions are under constant\ndevelopment and new products are often launched on the market. Therefore, there\nis a higher necessity of a standard criteria both for the evaluation of the\nkinds of function that these software provide, at use of practitioners and\nend-users, and for the definition of software requirements as a reference for\nthe developers that aim at being competitive on this market.\n  On the basis of our experience as pedestrian modellers and as researchers in\nthe crowd modelling area, we designed a comprehensive and detailed ready-to-use\nchecklist for the quantitative evaluation of Pedestrian Simulation Software\nfunctionalities that aims at capturing all the aspects that we claim that are\nuseful to undertake a professional study. These functions in our opinion are\nnecessary to provide accurate results in the planning of new facilities or\nschemes that involve pedestrian activities.

Sugarscape is one of the\nmost famous examples of a social agent-based model which has been used to show\nhow societies grow in the real world.\n  This paper builds on the Sugarscape model, using the Flexible Large scale\nAgent-based modelling Environment (FLAME) to simulate three different scenarios\nof the experiment, which are based on the Sugar and Citizen locations. FLAME is\nan agent-based modelling framework which has previously been used to model\nbiological and economic models. The paper includes details on how the model was\nwritten and the various parameters set for the simulation. The results of the\nmodel simulated are processed for three scenarios and analysed to see what\naffect the initial starting states of the agents had on the overall result\nobtained through the model and the variance in simulation time of processing\nthe model on multicore architectures.\n  The experiments highlight that there are limitations of the FLAME framework\nand writing simulation models in general which are highly dependent on initial\nstarting states of a model, also raising further potential work which can be\nbuilt into the Sugarscape model to study other interesting phenomenon in social\nand economic laws."

    "summary": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a widely used technique for\noptimization in decentralised control problems. However, most applications of\nMARL are in static environments, and are not suitable when agent behaviour and\nenvironment conditions are dynamic and uncertain. Addressing uncertainty in\nsuch environments remains a challenging problem for MARL-based systems. The\ndynamic nature of the environment causes previous knowledge of how agents\ninteract to become outdated. Advanced knowledge of potential changes through\nprediction significantly supports agents converging to near-optimal control\nsolutions. In this paper we propose P-MARL, a decentralised MARL algorithm\nenhanced by a prediction mechanism that provides accurate information regarding\nup-coming changes in the environment. This prediction is achieved by employing\nan Artificial Neural Network combined with a Self-Organising Map that detects\nand matches changes in the environment. The proposed algorithm is validated in\na realistic smart-grid scenario, and provides a 92% Pareto efficient solution\nto an electric vehicle charging problem."

We try to answer the question by proposing\na new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing\nagents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.\nConsider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by\nVicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but\nwith different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the\naverage of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of\nthis model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as\nsynchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior\n(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special\nagent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an\nordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so\nthat it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control\nlaw is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft\ncontrol is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural\nway to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting\nissues and challenges on the control of complex systems."

It\nconsiders contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and\ncritical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or\nnight) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node\nand sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to\nperform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context\ninterpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency\ncomprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB).\nContext agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node\nmanager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink\nnode by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager\nagent, fusing agent, and sink black board. A context at the sensor node\ntriggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager\nagent triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits\nactive sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to\nsink. The fusing agent uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is\nsimulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean\nsquare error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery\nusage and agent overhead."

    "summary": "We study the problem of locating a particularly dangerous node, the so-called\nblack hole in a synchronous anonymous ring network with mobile agents. A black\nhole is a harmful stationary process residing in a node of the network and\ndestroying destroys all mobile agents visiting that node without leaving any\ntrace. We consider the more challenging scenario when the agents are identical\nand initially scattered within the network. Moreover, we solve the problem with\nagents that have constant-sized memory and carry a constant number of identical\ntokens, which can be placed at nodes of the network. In contrast, the only\nknown solutions for the case of scattered agents searching for a black hole,\nuse stronger models where the agents have non-constant memory, can write\nmessages in whiteboards located at nodes or are allowed to mark both the edges\nand nodes of the network with tokens. This paper solves the problem for ring\nnetworks containing a single black hole. We are interested in the minimum\nresources (number of agents and tokens) necessary for locating all links\nincident to the black hole. We present deterministic algorithms for ring\ntopologies and provide matching lower and upper bounds for the number of agents\nand the number of tokens required for deterministic solutions to the black hole\nsearch problem, in oriented or unoriented rings, using movable or unmovable\ntokens."

    "summary": "The success of online auctions has given buyers access to greater product\ndiversity with potentially lower prices. It has provided sellers with access to\nlarge numbers of potential buyers and reduced transaction costs by enabling\nauctions to take place without regard to time or place. However it is difficult\nto spend more time period with system and closely monitor the auction until\nauction participant wins the bid or closing of the auction. Determining which\nitems to bid on or what may be the recommended bid and when to bid it are\ndifficult questions to answer for online auction participants. The multi agent\nauction advisor system JADE and TRACE, which is connected with decision support\nsystem, gives the recommended bid to buyers for online auctions. The auction\nadvisor system relies on intelligent agents both for the retrieval of relevant\nauction data and for the processing of that data to enable meaningful\nrecommendations, statistical reports and market prediction report to be made to\nauction participants."

The\nschemes discussed relate to well-known negotiation protocols proposed in\nearlier work and we consider a number of alternative notions of rationality\ncovering both quantitative measures, e.g. cooperative and individual\nrationality and more qualitative forms, e.g. Pigou-Dalton transfers. While it\nis known that imposing particular rationality and structural restrictions may\nresult in some reallocations of the resource set becoming unrealisable, in this\npaper we address the issue of the number of restricted rational deals that may\nbe required to implement a particular reallocation when it is possible to do\nso. We construct examples showing that this number may be exponential (in the\nnumber of resources m), even when all of the agent utility functions are\nmonotonic. We further show that k agents may achieve in a single deal a\nreallocation requiring exponentially many rational deals if at most k-1 agents\ncan participate, this same reallocation being unrealisable by any sequences of\nrational deals in which at most k-2 agents are involved."

    "summary": "Many current large-scale multiagent team implementations can be characterized\nas following the belief-desire-intention (BDI) paradigm, with explicit\nrepresentation of team plans. Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key\ncontribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for\nour BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results\nfrom two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster\nrescue simulation."

    "summary": "Effective coordination of agents actions in partially-observable domains is a\nmajor challenge of multi-agent systems research. To address this, many\nresearchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions\nbased on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically\nlearnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of\nthese approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary\ninformation is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end,\nwe argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is\none such mechanism. However, in a dynamically changing environment, the\naccuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity\nof the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on\nthese. Given this, we propose a novel information-sharing protocol,\npost-task-completion sharing, for the distribution of state information. We\nthen show, through a formal analysis, the improvement in the quality of\nestimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing\ninformation between nearest neighbours. Moreover, communication heuristics\ndesigned around our information-sharing principle are subjected to empirical\nevaluation along with other benchmark strategies (including Littmans Q-routing\nand Stones TPOT-RL) in a simulated call-routing application. These studies,\nconducted across a range of environmental settings, show that, compared to the\ndifferent benchmarks used, our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60%\nin the call connection rate; of more than 1000% in the ability to connect\nlong-distance calls; and incurs as low as 0.25 of the message overhead."

    "summary": "In this era of \"Services\" everywhere, with the explosive growth of E-Commerce\nand B2B transactions, there is a pressing need for the development of\nintelligent negotiation systems which consists of feasible architecture, a\nreliable framework and flexible multi agent based protocols developed in\nspecialized negotiation languages with complete semantics and support for\nmessage passing between the buyers and sellers. This is possible using web\nservices on the internet. The key issue is negotiation and its automation. In\nthis paper we review the classical negotiation methods and some of the existing\narchitectures and frameworks. We are proposing here a new combinatory framework\nand architecture, NAAS. The key feature in this framework is a component for\nprediction or probabilistic behavior pattern recognition of a buyer, along with\nthe other classical approaches of negotiation frameworks and architectures.\nNegotiation is practically very complex activity to automate without human\nintervention so in the future we also intend to develop a new protocol which\nwill facilitate automation of all the types of negotiation strategies like\nbargaining, bidding, auctions, under our NAAS framework."

In the classic\ncase, in which all coalitions are feasible, DyPE has half the memory\nrequirements of other DP approaches. On graph-restricted CSG, in which\nfeasibility is restricted by a (synergy) graph, DyPE has either the same or\nlower computational complexity depending on the underlying graph structure of\nthe problem. Our empirical evaluation shows that DyPE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art DP approaches by several orders of magnitude in a large range\nof graph structures (e.g. for certain scalefree graphs DyPE reduces the memory\nrequirements by $10^6$ and solves problems that previously needed hours in\nminutes)."

Updated-CNP is an effort\ntowards updating of a CNP in terms of its limitations of modifiability and\ncommunication overhead. The limitation of the modification of tasks, if the\ntask requirements change at any instance, corresponding to tasks which are\nallocated to contractor agents by manager agents is possible in our updated-CNP\nversion, which was not possible in the case of conventional-CNP, as it has to\nbe restarted in the case of task modification. This in turn will be reducing\nthe communication overhead of CNP, which is time taken by various agents using\nCNP to pass messages to each other. For the illustration of the updated CNP, we\nhave used a sound predator-prey case study."

    "summary": "We consider a smart grid with an independent system operator (ISO), and\ndistributed aggregators who have energy storage and purchase energy from the\nISO to serve its customers. All the entities in the system are foresighted:\neach aggregator seeks to minimize its own long-term payments for energy\npurchase and operational costs of energy storage by deciding how much energy to\nbuy from the ISO, and the ISO seeks to minimize the long-term total cost of the\nsystem (e.g. energy generation costs and the aggregators' costs) by dispatching\nthe energy production among the generators. The decision making of the entities\nis complicated for two reasons. First, the information is decentralized: the\nISO does not know the aggregators' states (i.e. their energy consumption\nrequests from customers and the amount of energy in their storage), and each\naggregator does not know the other aggregators' states or the ISO's state (i.e.\nthe energy generation costs and the status of the transmission lines). Second,\nthe coupling among the aggregators is unknown to them. Specifically, each\naggregator's energy purchase affects the price, and hence the payments of the\nother aggregators. However, none of them knows how its decision influences the\nprice because the price is determined by the ISO based on its state. We propose\na design framework in which the ISO provides each aggregator with a conjectured\nfuture price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-term\ncost based on its conjectured price as well as its local information. The\nproposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralized\nand involving complex coupling among the various entities."

The class of voluntary\nco-operational methods is included in the class of so-called directionals.\nDirectionals are mechanisms supporting the mutual coordination of autonomous\nagents.\n  Notations are provided capable of expressing residual fragments of\ndirectionals. An extensive example, involving promises about the suitability of\nprograms for tasks imposed on the promisee is presented. The example\nillustrates the dynamics of promises and more specifically the corresponding\nmechanism of trust updating and credibility updating. Trust levels and\ncredibility levels then determine the way certain promises and impositions are\nhandled.\n  The ubiquity of promises and impositions is further demonstrated with two\nextensive examples involving human behaviour: an artificial example about an\nagent planning a purchase, and a realistic example describing technology\nmediated interaction concerning the solution of pay station failure related\nproblems arising for an agent intending to leave the parking area."

    "summary": "Leading agent-based trust models address two important needs. First, they\nshow how an agent may estimate the trustworthiness of another agent based on\nprior interactions. Second, they show how agents may share their knowledge in\norder to cooperatively assess the trustworthiness of others. However, in\nreal-life settings, information relevant to trust is usually obtained\npiecemeal, not all at once. Unfortunately, the problem of maintaining trust has\ndrawn little attention. Existing approaches handle trust updates in a\nheuristic, not a principled, manner. This paper builds on a formal model that\nconsiders probability and certainty as two dimensions of trust. It proposes a\nmechanism using which an agent can update the amount of trust it places in\nother agents on an ongoing basis. This paper shows via simulation that the\nproposed approach (a) provides accurate estimates of the trustworthiness of\nagents that change behavior frequently; and (b) captures the dynamic behavior\nof the agents.

    "summary": "A flow of moving agents can be observed at different scales. Thus, in traffic\nmodeling, three levels are generally considered: the micro, meso and macro\nlevels, representing respectively the interactions between vehicles, groups of\nvehicles sharing common properties (such as a common destination or a common\nlocalization) and flows of vehicles. Each approach is useful in a given\ncontext: micro and meso models allow to simulate road networks with complex\ntopologies such as urban area, while macro models allow to develop control\nstrategies to prevent congestion in highways. However, to simulate large-scale\nroad networks, it can be interesting to integrate different representations,\ne.g., micro and macro, in a single model. Existing models share the same\nlimitation: connections between levels are fixed a priori and cannot be changed\nat runtime. Therefore, to be able to observe some emerging phenomena such as\ncongestion formation or to find the exact location of a jam in a large macro\nsection, a dynamic hybrid modeling approach is needed. In 2013 we started the\ndevelopment of a multi-level agent-based simulator called JAM-FREE within the\nISART project. It allows to simulate large road networks efficiently using a\ndynamic level of detail. This simulator relies on a multi-level agent-based\nmodeling framework called SIMILAR."

    "summary": "Discrete pedestrian simulation models are viable alternatives to particle\nbased approaches based on a continuous spatial representation. The effects of\ndiscretisation, however, also imply some difficulties in modelling certain\nphenomena that can be observed in reality. This paper focuses on the\npossibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated\npopulation of pedestrians by modifying an existing multi-agent model extending\nthe floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or\ncars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per\ntime step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but\nwe model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some\nturns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired\nwalking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain\nan average speed close to this threshold. In the paper we formally describe the\nmodel and we show the results of its application in benchmark scenarios.\nFinally, we also show how this approach can also support the definition of\nslopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians\nclimbing them in a simulated scenario."

A solution to this problem\nof upgrading an open system is to have a mechanism that allows agents to\nreceive a description of an interaction protocol and use it.

The second is multiagent\nconflict resolution planning, which entails generating and using AND/OR graphs\nto compactly represent conflict resolution (synthesis-process) plans for a\nDCSN. Together with the framework of local CM design developed in the authors'\nearlier work, the systematic approach supports separately designing local and\ndeconflicting CM's for individual agents in accordance to a selected conflict\nresolution plan. Composing the agent models and the CM's designed furnishes an\noverall nonblocking coordination solution that meets the set of inter-agent\nconstraints specified in a given DCSN."

In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture, using a\nCellular Automaton and a Multi-Agent System to handle the dangerous container\nstorage problem. It is an optimization problem since the aim is to improve the\ncontainer terminal configuration, that is, the way hazardous containers are\ndispatched through the terminal to improve its security. In our model, we\nconsider containers as agents, in order to use a Multi-Agent System for the\ndecision aid software, and a Cellular Automaton for modelling the terminal\nitself. To validate our approach many tests have been performed and the results\nshow the relevance of our model."

We introduce an empirically grounded,\nspatially explicit, agent-based model, InnoMind Innovation diffusion driven by\nchanging Minds), to simulate the effects of policy interventions and social\ninfluence on consumers transport mode preferences. The agents in this model\nrepresent individual consumers. They are calibrated based on empirically\nderived attributes and characteristics of survey respondents. We model agent\ndecision-making with artificial neural networks that account for the role of\nemotions in information processing. We present simulations of 4 scenarios for\nthe diffusion of EVs in the city of Berlin, Germany (3 policy scenarios and 1\nbase case). The results illustrate the varying effectiveness of measures in\ndifferent market segments and the need for appropriate policies tailored to the\nheterogeneous needs of different travelers. Moreover, the simulations suggest\nthat introducing an exclusive zone for EVs in the city would accelerate the\nearly-phase diffusion of EVs more effectively than financial incentives only."

Two\nexperiments were conducted with two separate sets of students and their\nsolutions were analysed using a combination of simple objective metrics and\nsubjective analysis. The analysis suggested that ACRE by default prevents some\ncommon problems arising that would limit the reliability and extensibility of\nconversation-handling code.\n  As ACRE has to date been integrated only with the Agent Factory multi agent\nframework, it was necessary to verify that the problems identified are not\nunique to that platform.

    "summary": "Intelligent Agents act in open and thus risky environments, hence making the\nappropriate decision about who to trust in order to interact with, could be a\nchallenging process. As intelligent agents are gradually enriched with Semantic\nWeb technology, acting on behalf of their users with limited or no human\nintervention, their ability to perform assigned tasks is scrutinized. Hence,\ntrust and reputation models, based on interaction trust or witness reputation,\nhave been proposed, yet they often presuppose the use of a centralized\nauthority. Although such mechanisms are more popular, they are usually faced\nwith skepticism, since users may question the trustworthiness and the\nrobustness of a central authority. Distributed models, on the other hand, are\nmore complex but they provide personalized estimations based on each agent's\ninterests and preferences. To this end, this article proposes DISARM, a novel\ndistributed reputation model. DISARM deals MASs as social networks, enabling\nagents to establish and maintain relationships, limiting the disadvantages of\nthe common distributed approaches. Additionally, it is based on defeasible\nlogic, modeling the way intelligent agents, like humans, draw reasonable\nconclusions from incomplete and possibly conflicting (thus inconclusive)\ninformation. Finally, we provide an evaluation that illustrates the usability\nof the proposed model."

For\na specific variation of best-response heuristics, they proved initial existence\nand convergence results in the Plurality voting system.\n  In this paper, we extend the model in multiple directions, considering voters\nwith different uncertainty levels, simultaneous strategic decisions, and a more\npermissive notion of best-response. We prove that a voting equilibrium exists\neven in the most general case.

Autonomous agents provide an exacting atomic and local\nmodel for finite spacetime, which quickly reveals the issues of incomplete\ninformation and non-locality. From this we should be able to reconstruct all\nother notions of spacetime.\n  The aim of this exercise is to apply related tools and ideas to an initial\nunification of real and artificial spaces, e.g. databases and information webs\nwith natural spacetime.

A large scale system may have billions of\npossible ways of organization, which makes it impractical to find an optimal\nchoice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this paper, we\npropose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing\nhierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm,\ncalled the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with\na repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic\nhierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array\nrepresentation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operator-literate. A\ncase study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is\nprovided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which\nlead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the\nproposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. Compared with the\ntraditional genetic operators, the newly introduced operators produced better\norganizations of higher utility more consistently in a variety of test cases.\nThe proposed algorithm extends of the search processes of the state-of-the-art\nmulti-agent organization design methodologies, and is more computationally\nefficient in a large search space."

In this\npaper, the effects of failure and noise in the communication between agents are\nanalyzed upon a connectivity maintenance control strategy. The results show\nthat the connectivity strategy is resilient to the negative effects of such\ndisturbances under realistic settings that consider a bandwidth limit for the\ncontrol effort. This opens the perspective of applying the connectivity\nmaintenance strategy in adaptive schemes that consider, for instance,\nautonomous adaptation to constraints other than connectivity itself, e.g.\ncommunication efficiency and energy harvesting."

    "summary": "We examine the behavior of multi-agent networks where information-sharing is\nsubject to a positive communications cost over the edges linking the agents. We\nconsider a general mean-square-error formulation where all agents are\ninterested in estimating the same target vector. We first show that, in the\nabsence of any incentives to cooperate, the optimal strategy for the agents is\nto behave in a selfish manner with each agent seeking the optimal solution\nindependently of the other agents. Pareto inefficiency arises as a result of\nthe fact that agents are not using historical data to predict the behavior of\ntheir neighbors and to know whether they will reciprocate and participate in\nsharing information. Motivated by this observation, we develop a reputation\nprotocol to summarize the opponent's past actions into a reputation score,\nwhich can then be used to form a belief about the opponent's subsequent\nactions. The reputation protocol entices agents to cooperate and turns their\noptimal strategy into an action-choosing strategy that enhances the overall\nsocial benefit of the network. In particular, we show that when the\ncommunications cost becomes large, the expected social benefit of the proposed\nprotocol outperforms the social benefit that is obtained by cooperative agents\nthat always share data. We perform a detailed mean-square-error analysis of the\nevolution of the network over three domains: far field, near-field, and\nmiddle-field, and show that the network behavior is stable for sufficiently\nsmall step-sizes. The various theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nsimulations."

The goal is to ensure that\n$p$ wins by shifting $p$ higher in some voters' preference orders. However,\neach such shift request comes at a price (depending on the voter and on the\nextent of the shift) and we must not exceed the given budget. We study the\nparameterized computational complexity of Shift Bribery with respect to a\nnumber of parameters (pertaining to the nature of the solution sought and the\nsize of the election) and several classes of price functions. When we\nparameterize Shift Bribery by the number of affected voters, then for each of\nour voting rules (Borda, Maximin, Copeland) the problem is W[2]-hard. If,\ninstead, we parameterize by the number of positions by which $p$ is shifted in\ntotal,then the problem is fixed-parameter tractable for Borda and Maximin,and\nis W[1]-hard for Copeland. If we parameterize by the budget, then the results\ndepend on the price function class. We also show that Shift Bribery tends to be\ntractable when parameterized by the number of voters, but that the results for\nthe number of candidates are more enigmatic."

Having an effective reputation\nsystem is critical to this type of internet service because it can assist\nbuyers to evaluate the trustworthiness of sellers, and it can also improve the\nrevenue for reputable sellers and E-commerce operators. We formulate a\nstochastic model to analyze an eBay-like reputation system and propose four\nmeasures to quantify its effectiveness: (1) new seller ramp up time, (2) new\nseller drop out probability, (3) long term profit gains for sellers, and (4)\naverage per seller transaction gains for the E-commerce operator. Through our\nanalysis, we identify key factors which influence these four measures. We\npropose a new insurance mechanism which consists of an insurance protocol and a\ntransaction mechanism to improve the above four measures. We show that our\ninsurance mechanism can reduce the ramp up time by around 87.2%, and guarantee\nnew sellers ramp up before the deadline $T_w$ with a high probability (close to\n1.0). It also increases the long term profit gains and average per seller\ntransaction gains by at least 95.3%."

An activity schedule consists of a sequence of activity instances,\neach with its assigned start time, duration and location, together with\ntransport modes used for travel between subsequent activity locations. A\ncritical step in the development of simulation models is validation. Despite\nthe growing importance of activity-based models in modelling transport and\nmobility, there has been so far no work focusing specifically on statistical\nvalidation of such models. In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation\nFramework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that allows exploiting historical\nreal-world data to assess the validity of activity-based models. The framework\ncompares temporal and spatial properties and the structure of activity\nschedules against real-world travel diaries and origin-destination matrices.

The computation\nof norms by considering agents' playing multiple roles in their social contexts\nhas not been studied before. To make the problem even more realistic for open\nsocieties, we do not assume that agents share knowledge on their common\nresources. So, they have to compute semantic agreements towards performing\ntheir joint actions. %The paper reports on an empirical study of whether and\nhow efficiently societies of agents converge to norms, exploring the proposed\nsocial learning processes w.r.t. different society sizes, and the ways agents\nare connected.

This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic\nmodelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion\ndecays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the\nreliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its\nweight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with\nits opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can\nbe extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse.\nWe illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral\ninformation in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of\nthe uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior.

    "summary": "In a previous study, we considered an information-theoretic model of code\nevolution. In it, agents obtain information about their (common) environment by\nthe perception of messages of other agents, which is determined by an\ninteraction probability (the structure of the population). For an agent to\nunderstand another agent's messages, the former must either know the identity\nof the latter, or the code producing the messages must be universally\ninterpretable. A universal code, however, introduces a vulnerability: a\nparasitic entity can take advantage of it. Here, we investigate this problem.\nIn our specific setting, we consider a parasite to be an agent that tries to\ninflict as much damage as possible in the mutual understanding of the\npopulation (i.e. the parasite acts as a disinformation agent). We show that,\nafter introducing a parasite in the population, the former adopts a code such\nthat it captures the information about the environment that is missing in the\npopulation. Such agent would be of great value, but only if the rest of the\npopulation could understand its messages. However, it is of little use here,\nsince the parasite utilises the most common messages in the population to\nexpress different concepts. Now we let the population respond by updating their\ncodes such that, in this arms race, they again maximise their mutual\nunderstanding. As a result, there is a code drift in the population where the\nutilisation of the messages of the parasite is avoided. A consequence of this\nis that the information that the parasite possesses but the agents lack becomes\nunderstandable and readily available."

    "summary": "Cooperative ITS is enabling vehicles to communicate with the infrastructure\nto provide improvements in traffic control. A promising approach consists in\nanticipating the road profile and the upcoming dynamic events like traffic\nlights. This topic has been addressed in the French public project Co-Drive\nthrough functions developed by Valeo named Green Light Optimal Speed Advisor\n(GLOSA). The system advises the optimal speed to pass the next traffic light\nwithout stopping. This paper presents results of its performance in different\nscenarios through simulations and real driving measurements. A scaling is done\nin an urban area, with different penetration rates in vehicle and\ninfrastructure equipment for vehicular communication. Our simulation results\nindicate that GLOSA can reduce CO2 emissions, waiting time and travel time,\nboth in experimental conditions and in real traffic conditions."

    "summary": "In complex, open, and heterogeneous environments, agents must be able to\nreorganize towards the most appropriate organizations to adapt unpredictable\nenvironment changes within Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Types of reorganization\ncan be seen from two different levels. The individual agents level\n(micro-level) in which an agent changes its behaviors and interactions with\nother agents to adapt its local environment. And the organizational level\n(macro-level) in which the whole system changes it structure by adding or\nremoving agents. This chapter is dedicated to overview different aspects of\nwhat is called MAS Organization including its motivations, paradigms, models,\nand techniques adopted for statically or dynamically organizing agents in MAS."

Various normative architectures have been proposed for designing\nnormative multi-agent systems (NorMAS). Due to human nature of the concept\nnorms, many of these architectures are built based on theories in social\nsciences. Tipping point theory, as is briefly discussed in this paper, seems to\nhave a great potential to be used for designing normative architectures. This\ntheory deals with the factors that affect social epidemics that arise in human\nsocieties. In this paper, we try to apply the main concepts of this theory to\nagent-based normative architectures. We show several ways to implement these\nconcepts, and study their effects in an agent-based normative scenario."

The main objective of such organizations is the exploration of\nthe social energy from the existing societies.

Our goal is to prove and verify the effectiveness of\nthis model by performing various simulations using the NetLogo environment, a\ntool that allows agent-based rapid prototyping. We begin by simulating trivial\nreal life activities that demonstrate the main properties of the core unit of\nthe FSO, namely the SoC. Further, more complex scenarios involving various\nnested SoCs are simulated. Two main simulation models are presented, allowing\nus to obtain preliminary results using the FSO concepts as a potential\nsolution. In the first simulation model we demonstrate that by the use of FSO\nproperties the individuals may benefit by receiving more qualitative healthcare\nservices, while in the second simulation model we show how it might be possible\nto improve the fall detection systems by the use of FSO mechanism."

Macroscopic pedestrian models, which are mainly based on fluid\ndynamics, are often used to simulate huge crowds due to their low computational\ncosts (Columbo & Rosini 2005). Similar approaches are used in the field of\ntraffic simulations (Lighthill & Whitham 1955).

    "summary": "The increased complexity and dynamism of present and future Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) enforce the need for considering both of their static\n(design-time) and the dynamic (run-time) aspects. A type of balance between the\ntwo aspects can definitely give better results related to system stability and\nadaptivity. MAS organization is the research area that is concerned with these\nissues and it is currently a very active and interesting research area.\nDesigning a MAS with an initial organization and giving it the ability to\ndynamically reorganize to adapt the dynamic changes of its unpredictable and\nuncertain environment, is the feasible way to survive and to run effectively.\nNormally, MAS organization is tackled by what is called, MAS organizational\nmodels, which are concerned with the description (formally or informally) of\nthe structural and dynamical aspects of agent organizations. This paper\nproposes a two-dimension space, called MOS-2, for positioning and assessing MAS\norganizational models based on two dimensions: their adopted engineering\nviewpoint (agent-centered or organization-centered) as the vertical dimension\nand the agents awareness/unawareness of the existence of the organizational\nlevel as the horizontal dimension. The MOS-2 space is applied for positioning a\nnumber of familiar organizational models. Its future trends and possible\nimprovements are highlighted. They include the following, (1) adding Time as a\ndimension, (2) increasing the considered dimensions, (3) providing a\nquantitative approach for positioning MAS organizational models."

The aggressiveness is\nunderstood as an ability to win conflicts and push through the crowd.

The influence of the\naggressiveness is studied by means of the dependence of the travel time on the\noccupancy of a room.

    "summary": "Many companies now use crowdsourcing to leverage external (as well as\ninternal) crowds to perform specialized work, and so methods of improving\nefficiency are critical. Tasks in crowdsourcing systems with specialized work\nhave multiple steps and each step requires multiple skills. Steps may have\ndifferent flexibilities in terms of obtaining service from one or multiple\nagents, due to varying levels of dependency among parts of steps. Steps of a\ntask may have precedence constraints among them. Moreover, there are variations\nin loads of different types of tasks requiring different skill-sets and\navailabilities of different types of agents with different skill-sets.\nConsidering these constraints together necessitates the design of novel schemes\nto allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require\nallocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized and offer customers\n(task requesters) the freedom to choose agents. In this work we study the\nperformance limits of such crowdsourcing systems and propose efficient\nallocation schemes that provably meet the performance limits under these\nadditional requirements. We demonstrate our algorithms on data from a\ncrowdsourcing platform run by a non-profit company and show significant\nimprovements over current practice."

    "summary": "Agent technology, a new paradigm in software engineering, has received\nattention from research and industry since 1990s. However, it is still not used\nwidely to date because it requires expertise on both programming and agent\ntechnology; gaps among requirements, agent design, and agent deployment also\npose more difficulties. Goal Net methodology attempts to solve these issues\nwith a goal-oriented approach that resembles human behaviours, and an agent\ndesigner that supports agent development using this philosophy. However, there\nare limitations on existing Goal Net Designer, the design and modelling\ncomponent of the agent designer. Those limitations, including limited access,\ndifficult deployment, inflexibility in user operations, design workflows\nagainst typical Goal Net methodology workflows, and lack of data protection,\nhave inhibited widespread adoption of Goal Net methodology.\n  Motivated by this, this book focuses on improvements on Goal Net Designer. In\nthis project, Goal Net Designer is completely re-implemented using new\ntechnology with optimised software architecture and design. It allows access\nfrom all major desktop operating systems, as well as in web environment via all\nmodern browsers. Enhancements such as refined workflows, model validation tool,\naccess control, team collaboration tool, and link to compiler make Goal Net\nDesigner a fully functional and powerful Integrated Development Environment.\nUser friendliness and usability are greatly enhanced by simplifying user's\nactions to accomplish their tasks. User behaviour logging and quantitative\nfeedback channel are also included to allow Goal Net Designer to continuously\nevolve with the power of big data analytics in future. To evaluate the new Goal\nNet Designer, a teachable agent has been developed with the help of Goal Net\nDesigner and the development process is illustrated in a case study."

    "summary": "Increased stress, fuel consumption, air pollution, accidents and delays are\nsome of the consequences of traffic congestion usually incurring in tremendous\neconomic impacts, which society aims to remedy in order to leverage a\nsustainable development. Recently, unconventional means for modeling and\ncontrolling such complex traffic systems relying on multi-agent systems have\narisen. This paper contributes to the understanding of such complex and highly\ndynamic systems by proposing an open-source tool-chain to implement\nmulti-agent-based solutions in traffic and transportation. The proposed\napproach relies on two very popular tools in both domains, with focus on\ntraffic light control. This tool-chain consists in combining JADE (Java Agent\nDEvelopment Framework), for the implementation of multi-agent systems, with\nSUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), for the microscopic simulation of traffic\ninteractions. TraSMAPI (Traffic Simulation Manager Application Programming\nInterface) is used to combine JADE and SUMO allowing communication between\nthem. A demonstration of the concept is presented to illustrate the main\nfeatures of this tool-chain, using Q-Learning as the reinforcement learning\nmethod for each traffic light agent in a simulated network. Results demonstrate\nthe feasibility of the proposed framework as a practical means to experiment\nwith different agent-based designs of intelligent transportation solutions."

    "summary": "Robots playing games that humans are adept in is a challenge. We studied\nrobotic agents playing Chain Catch game as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Our game\nstarts with a traditional Catch game similar to Pursuit evasion, and further\nextends it to form a growing chain of predator agents to chase remaining preys.\nHence Chain Catch is a combination of two challenges - pursuit domain and\nrobotic chain formation. These are games that require team of robotic agents to\ncooperate among themselves and to compete with other group of agents through\nquick decision making. In this paper, we present a Chain Catch simulator that\nallows us to incorporate game rules, design strategies and simulate the game\nplay. We developed cost model driven strategies for each of Escapee, Catcher\nand Chain. Our results show that Sliding slope strategy is the best strategy\nfor Escapees whereas Tagging method is the best method for chain s movement in\nChain Catch. We also use production quality robots to implement the game play\nin a physical environment and analyze game strategies on real robots. Our real\nrobots implementation in different scenarios shows that game strategies work as\nexpected and a complete chain formation takes place successfully in each game."

Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our\ntheoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms\nstate-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the\nroad.

    "summary": "Reaching some form of consensus is often necessary for autonomous agents that\nwant to coordinate their actions or otherwise engage in joint activities. One\nway to reach a consensus is by aggregating individual information, such as\ndecisions, beliefs, preferences and constraints. Judgment aggregation is a\nsocial choice method, which generalises voting, that studies the aggregation of\nindividual judgments regarding the truth-value of logically related\npropositions. As such, judgment aggregation is applicable for consensus\nreaching problems in multi agent systems. As other social choice theory,\njudgment aggregation research is abundant with impossibility results. However,\nthe aim of this tutorial is to give an introduction to the methods of judgment\naggregation, not the impossibility results. In particular, the tutorial will\nintroduce the basic frameworks that model judgment aggregation problems and\ngive an overview of the judgment aggregation functions so far developed as well\nas their social theoretic and computational complexity properties. The focus of\nthe tutorial are consensus reaching problems in multi agent systems that can be\nmodelled as judgment aggregation problems. The desirable properties of a\njudgment aggregation method applied to these problems are not necessarily the\nsame as properties desirable in legal or political contexts, which is\nconsidered to be the native domain of judgment aggregation. After this tutorial\nthe participants are expected to be able to read and understand judgment\naggregation literature and have a grasp on the state-of-the-art and open\nquestions in judgment aggregation research of interest to multi agent systems."

    "summary": "This paper addresses the issues concerning the rescheduling of a static\ntimetable in case of a disaster encountered in a large and complex railway\nnetwork system. The proposed approach tries to modify the schedule so as to\nminimise the overall delay of trains. This is achieved by representing the\nrescheduling problem in the form of a Petri-Net and the highly uncertain\ndisaster recovery times in such a model is handled as Markov Decision Processes\n(MDP ). For solving the rescheduling problem, a istributed Constraint\nOptimisation (DCOP ) based strategy involving the use of autonomous agents is\nused to generate the desired schedule. The proposed approach is evaluated on\nthe actual schedule of the Eastern Railways, India by constructing vari- ous\ndisaster scenarios using the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE). When\ncompared to the existing approaches, the proposed framework substantially\nreduces the delay of trains after rescheduling."

    "summary": "This paper studies how the communication network affects the power\nutilization and fairness in a simplified power system model, composed by three\ncoupled layers: physical, communication and regulatory. Using an agent-based\napproach, we build a scenario where individuals may cooperate (by removing a\nload) or not (by keeping their loads or adding one more). The agent decision\nreflects its desire of maximizing the delivered power based on its internal\nstate, its global state perception, a randomized selfishness related to its\nwillingness to follow demand-side control requests, and the state information\nreceived from its neighbors in the communication network. Our focus is to\nunderstand how the network topology and errors in the communication layer\naffect the agents' behavior, reflected in the power utilization and fairness\nfor different demand-side policies. Our results show that for optimal power\nutilization and fairness a global knowledge about the system is needed. We show\nthat close to optimal results can be archived with either a demand control\nsignal or a global pricing for energy."

    "summary": "A team of identical and oblivious ant-like agents - a(ge)nts - leaving\npheromone traces, are programmed to jointly patrol an area modeled as a graph.\nThey perform this task using simple local interactions, while also achieving\nthe important byproduct of partitioning the graph into roughly equal-sized\ndisjoint sub-graphs. Each a(ge)nt begins to operate at an arbitrary initial\nlocation, and throughout its work does not acquire any information on either\nthe shape or size of the graph, or the number or whereabouts of other a(ge)nts.\nGraph partitioning occurs spontaneously, as each of the a(ge)nts patrols and\nexpands its own pheromone-marked sub-graph, or region. This graph partitioning\nalgorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic\nballoons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region\nmore frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent\nvertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding\nits region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a\nregion ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely\nproportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller\nregion will effectively exert higher \"pressure\" at its borders, and conquer\nadjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region\nand shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes\nof the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical\nballoons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.\nThe pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to\nevolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the\ngraph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the\nsystem settles into a stable and balanced partition."

    "summary": "This paper introduces a demand-side distributed and secured energy commitment\nframework and operations for a Power Producer and Supplier (PPS) in deregulated\nenvironment. Due to the diversity of geographical location as well as\ncustomers' energy profile coupled with high number of customers, managing\nenergy transactions and resulting energy exchanges are challenging for a PPS.\nThe envisioned PPS maintains several aggregators (e.g. Microgrids), named as\nSub Service Provider (SSP) that manage customers/subscribers under their\ndomains. The SSPs act as agents that perform local energy matching (inside\ntheir domains) and distributed energy matching within SSPs to determine the\nenergy commitment. The goal of the distributed energy matching is to reduce the\ninvolvement of External Energy Supplier (e.g. Utility) while providing a\nplatform to demand side players to be a part of energy transaction. A\ndistributed assignment problem is designed that requires minimum and aggregated\ninformation exchange (hence, secured) and solved by Linear Programming (LP)\nthat provides the distributed matching decision. The communicative burden among\nSSPs due to the exchange of energy information is reduced by applying an\nadaptive coalition formation method. The simulations are conducted by\nimplementing a synchronous distributed matching algorithm while showing the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "summary": "Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be\nchallenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's\nintent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time\nefficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring\nagents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work\npresents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a\nnovel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads\nthe online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline\nlearning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value\nnetwork that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint\nconfiguration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value\nnetwork not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for\nfinding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in\nthe other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26 percent\nimprovement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with\noptimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision\navoidance strategy."

    "summary": "Autonomous Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems can utilize fleet management\nstrategies in order to provide a high customer quality of service (QoS).\nPrevious works on autonomous MOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing\nsingle capacity vehicles, where QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing.\nThis work focuses on MOD systems utilizing a small number of vehicles, such as\nthose found on a campus, where additional vehicles cannot be introduced as\ndemand for rides increases. A predictive positioning method is presented for\nimproving customer QoS by identifying key locations to position the fleet in\norder to minimize expected customer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a\nmeans for improving customer QoS as arrival rates increase. However, with\nridesharing perceived QoS is dependent on an often unknown customer preference.\nTo address this challenge, a customer ratings model, which learns customer\npreference from a 5-star rating, is developed and incorporated directly into a\nridesharing algorithm. The predictive positioning and ridesharing methods are\napplied to simulation of a real-world campus MOD system.A combined predictive\npositioning and ridesharing approach is shown to reduce customer service times\nby up to 29% and the customer ratings model is shown to provide the best\noverall MOD fleet management performance over a range of customer preferences."

    "summary": "We consider distributed multitask learning problems over a network of agents\nwhere each agent is interested in estimating its own parameter vector, also\ncalled task, and where the tasks at neighboring agents are related according to\na set of linear equality constraints. Each agent possesses its own convex cost\nfunction of its parameter vector and a set of linear equality constraints\ninvolving its own parameter vector and the parameter vectors of its neighboring\nagents. We propose an adaptive stochastic algorithm based on the projection\ngradient method and diffusion strategies in order to allow the network to\noptimize the individual costs subject to all constraints. Although the\nderivation is carried out for linear equality constraints, the technique can be\napplied to other forms of convex constraints. We conduct a detailed\nmean-square-error analysis of the proposed algorithm and derive closed-form\nexpressions to predict its learning behavior. We provide simulations to\nillustrate the theoretical findings. Finally, the algorithm is employed for\nsolving two problems in a distributed manner: a minimum-cost flow problem over\na network and a space-time varying field reconstruction problem."

    "summary": "The modelling and simulation of the interaction among vehicles and\npedestrians during cross-walking is an open challenge for both research and\npractical computational solutions supporting urban/traffic decision makers and\nmanagers. The social cost of pedestrians' risky behaviour pushes the\ndevelopment of a new generation of computational models integrating analytical\nknowledge, data and experience about the complex dynamics occurring in\npedestrian/vehicle interactions, which are not completely understood despite\nrecent efforts. This paper presents the results of a significant data gathering\ncampaign realised at an unsignalized zebra crossing. The selected area of the\ncity of Milan (Italy) is characterised by a significant presence of elderly\ninhabitants and pedestrian-vehicle risky interactions, testified by a high\nnumber of accidents involving pedestrians in the past years. The results\nconcern the analysis of: (i) vehicular and pedestrian traffic volumes; (ii)\nlevel of service; (iii) pedestrian-vehicle interactions, considering the impact\nof ageing on crossing behaviour. Results showed that the phenomenon is\ncharacterised by three main phases: approaching, appraising (evaluation of the\ndistance and speed of oncoming vehicles) and crossing. The final objective of\nthe research is to support the development of a microscopic agent-based tool\nfor simulating pedestrian behaviour at unsignalized crosswalks, focusing on the\nspecific needs of the elderly pedestrians."

    "summary": "Computer-based simulation of pedestrian dynamics reached meaningful results\nin the last decade, thanks to empirical evidences and acquired knowledge\nfitting fundamental diagram constraints and space utilization. Moreover,\ncomputational models for pedestrian wayfinding often neglect extensive\nempirical evidences supporting the calibration and validation phase of\nsimulations. The paper presents the results of a set of controlled experiments\n(with human volunteers) designed and performed to understand pedestrian's route\nchoice. The setting offers alternative paths to final destinations, at\ndifferent crowding conditions. Results show that the length of paths and level\nof congestion influence decisions (negative feedback), as well as imitative\nbehaviour of \"emergent leaders\" choosing a new path (positive feedback). A\nnovel here illustrated model for the simulation of pedestrian route choice\ncaptures such evidences, encompassing both the tendency to avoid congestion and\nto follow emerging leaders. The found conflicting tendencies are modelled with\nthe introduction of a utility function allowing a consistent calibration over\nthe achieved results. A demonstration of the simulated dynamics on a larger\nscenario will be also illustrated in the paper."

The approach presented can be seen as part of the\n\\emph{Belief Desire Intention} (BDI) framework, also can address the problem of\ncooperative, legal, safe, considerate and emphatic decisions by robots if their\nindividual and group rewards are suitably defined. After theoretical analysis\nthe performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on four simulation\nscenarios.

    "summary": "Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important and\nurgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace\nin the near future. Although this problem has been studied in the past, there\nhas not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for\nvehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances\nand potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and\nsafety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many\nsmall-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most\ncases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the\nexponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system\ndimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability\nprovides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority\nordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path\nplanning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve \"space-time\" portions in the airspace,\nand the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,\nand optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation\ncomplexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and\nan intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can\ntractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with\ngeneral nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in\nrepresentative simulations."

The concept of serial processing in the graph has\nbeen successfully applied in sum-product based algorithms and here provides\ninspiration for an algorithm which makes use of the most up-to-date information\nin the graph in combination with the diffusion approach to offer improved\nperformance."

    "summary": "We review disruptive innovations introduced in the RoboCup 2D Soccer\nSimulation League over the twenty years since its inception, and trace the\nprogress of our champion team (Gliders). We conjecture that the League has been\ndeveloping as an ecosystem shaped by diverse approaches taken by participating\nteams, increasing in its overall complexity. A common feature is that different\nchampion teams succeeded in finding a way to decompose the enormous\nsearch-space of possible single- and multi-agent behaviours, by automating the\nexploration of the problem space with various techniques which accelerated the\nsoftware development efforts. These methods included interactive debugging,\nmachine learning, automated planning, and opponent modelling. The winning\napproach developed by Gliders is centred on human-based evolutionary\ncomputation which optimised several components such as an action-dependent\nevaluation function, dynamic tactics with Voronoi diagrams, information\ndynamics, and bio-inspired collective behaviour."

    "summary": "Advancement in intelligent transportation systems with complex operations\nrequires autonomous planning and management to avoid collisions in day-to-day\ntraffic. As failure and/or inadequacy in traffic safety system are\nlife-critical, such collisions must be detected and resolved in an efficient\nway to manage continuously rising traffic. In this paper, we address different\ntypes of collision scenarios along with their early detection and resolution\ntechniques in a complex railway system. In order to handle collisions\ndynamically in distributed manner, a novel agent based solution approach is\nproposed using the idea of max-sum algorithm, where each agent (train agent,\nstation agent, and junction agent) communicates and cooperates with others to\ngenerate a good feasible solution that keeps the system in a safe state, i.e.,\ncollision free. We implement the proposed mechanism in Java Agent DEvelopment\nFramework (JADE). The results are evaluated with exhaustive experiments and\ncompared with different existing collision handling methods to show the\nefficiency of our proposed approach."

    "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) is able to characterize the behavior of individual\nagent and the interaction between agents. Thus, it motivates us to leverage the\ndistributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling\nMAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).\nTwo issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet\nincluding: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the\nnegtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which\nkind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the\nquality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with\nan ECAV-$\\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\\eta$\nwith an adequate assignment ($\\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the\nscale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed\non the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the\nsolution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the\nMax-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method\n(LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to\ntransform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition, it is also\napparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the\nnumber of users increases but the available resource at base stations are\nlimited."

We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems\nwhenadding and deleting voters have a \\emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add\n(resp.\\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\\ delete) a bundle~$\\kappa(v) $\nof voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\\kappa(v)$ may have\nmore than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.\nWe analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for\nthe Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is\ncomputationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling\nrelation is symmetric (i.e.\\ $\\forall w\\colon w \\in \\kappa(v) \\Leftrightarrow v\n\\in \\kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,\nthen destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive\nvariant remains $\\NP$-hard.

ACT provides an empirically derived mathematical\nmodel of culturally shared sentiments as heuristic guides for human decision\nmaking. BayesACT, a variant on classical ACT, combines affective reasoning with\ncognitive (denotative or logical) reasoning as is traditionally found in AI.\nBayes\\-ACT allows for the creation of agents that are both emotionally guided\nand goal-directed. In this work, we simulate BayesACT agents in the Iterated\nNetworked Prisoner's Dilemma (INPD), and we show four out of five known\nproperties of human play in INPD are replicated by these socio-affective\nagents. In particular, we show how the observed human behaviours of network\nstructure invariance, anti-correlation of cooperation and reward, and player\ntype stratification are all clearly emergent properties of the networked\nBayesACT agents. We further show that decision hyteresis (Moody Conditional\nCooperation) is replicated by BayesACT agents in over $2/3$ of the cases we\nhave considered. In contrast, previously used imitation-based agents are only\nable to replicate one of the five properties.

In this\npaper, we introduce a technique for speeding up multi-agent learning by\nexploiting concurrent and incremental experience sharing. This solution\nadaptively identifies opportunities to transfer experiences between agents and\nallows for the rapid acquisition of appropriate policies in large-scale,\nstochastic, homogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce an online,\ndistributed, supervisor-directed transfer technique for constructing high-level\ncharacterizations of an agent's dynamic learning environment---called\ncontexts---which are used to identify groups of agents operating under\napproximately similar dynamics within a short temporal window. A set of\nsupervisory agents computes contextual information for groups of subordinate\nagents, thereby identifying candidates for experience sharing. Our method uses\na tiered architecture to propagate, with low communication overhead, state,\naction, and reward data amongst the members of each dynamically-identified\ninformation-sharing group. We applied this method to a large-scale distributed\ntask allocation problem with hundreds of information-sharing agents operating\nin an unknown, non-stationary environment. We demonstrate that our approach\nresults in significant performance gains, that it is robust to noise-corrupted\nor suboptimal context features, and that communication costs scale linearly\nwith the supervisor-to-subordinate ratio."

The individual decisions are based on different local\ninformation generated by the agents with a finite lifetime and disseminated in\nthe system with a finite velocity. We derive critical parameters for the\nemergence of minorities and majorities of agents making opposite decisions and\ninvestigate their spatial organization. We find that dependent on two essential\nparameters describing the local impact and the spatial dissemination of\ninformation, either a definite stable minority/majority relation\n(single-attractor regime) or a broad range of possible values (multi-attractor\nregime) occurs. In the latter case, the outcome of the decision process becomes\nrather diverse and hard to predict, both with respect to the share of the\nmajority and their spatial distribution. We further investigate how a\ndissemination of information on different time scales affects the outcome of\nthe decision process. We find that a more ``efficient'' information exchange\nwithin a subpopulation provides a suitable way to stabilize their majority\nstatus and to reduce ``diversity'' and uncertainty in the decision process."

But then, can the coalition structure found via a\npartial search be guaranteed to be within a bound from optimum? We show that\nnone of the previous coalition structure generation algorithms can establish\nany bound because they search fewer nodes than a threshold that we show\nnecessary for establishing a bound. We present an algorithm that establishes a\ntight bound within this minimal amount of search, and show that any other\nalgorithm would have to search strictly more. The fraction of nodes needed to\nbe searched approaches zero as the number of agents grows. If additional time\nremains, our anytime algorithm searches further, and establishes a\nprogressively lower tight bound. Surprisingly, just searching one more node\ndrops the bound in half. As desired, our algorithm lowers the bound rapidly\nearly on, and exhibits diminishing returns to computation. It also drastically\noutperforms its obvious contenders.

    "summary": "We describe a framework and equations used to model and predict the behavior\nof multi-agent systems (MASs) with learning agents. A difference equation is\nused for calculating the progression of an agent's error in its decision\nfunction, thereby telling us how the agent is expected to fare in the MAS. The\nequation relies on parameters which capture the agent's learning abilities,\nsuch as its change rate, learning rate and retention rate, as well as relevant\naspects of the MAS such as the impact that agents have on each other. We\nvalidate the framework with experimental results using reinforcement learning\nagents in a market system, as well as with other experimental results gathered\nfrom the AI literature. Finally, we use PAC-theory to show how to calculate\nbounds on the values of the learning parameters."

    "summary": "Learning and adaptation is a fundamental property of intelligent agents. In\nthe context of adaptive information filtering, a filtering agent's beliefs\nabout a user's information needs have to be revised regularly with reference to\nthe user's most current information preferences. This learning and adaptation\nprocess is essential for maintaining the agent's filtering performance. The AGM\nbelief revision paradigm provides a rigorous foundation for modelling rational\nand minimal changes to an agent's beliefs. In particular, the maxi-adjustment\nmethod, which follows the AGM rationale of belief change, offers a sound and\nrobust computational mechanism to develop adaptive agents so that learning\nautonomy of these agents can be enhanced. This paper describes how the\nmaxi-adjustment method is applied to develop the learning components of\nadaptive information filtering agents, and discusses possible difficulties of\napplying such a framework to these agents."

    "summary": "With the increase in agent-based applications, there are now agent systems\nthat support \\emph{concurrent} client accesses. The ability to process large\nvolumes of simultaneous requests is critical in many such applications. In such\na setting, the traditional approach of serving these requests one at a time via\nqueues (e.g. \\textsf{FIFO} queues, priority queues) is insufficient.\nAlternative models are essential to improve the performance of such\n\\emph{heavily loaded} agents. In this paper, we propose a set of\n\\emph{cost-based algorithms} to \\emph{optimize} and \\emph{merge} multiple\nrequests submitted to an agent. In order to merge a set of requests, one first\nneeds to identify commonalities among such requests. First, we provide an\n\\emph{application independent framework} within which an agent developer may\nspecify relationships (called \\emph{invariants}) between requests. Second, we\nprovide two algorithms (and various accompanying heuristics) which allow an\nagent to automatically rewrite requests so as to avoid redundant work---these\nalgorithms take invariants associated with the agent into account. Our\nalgorithms are independent of any specific agent framework. For an\nimplementation, we implemented both these algorithms on top of the \\impact\nagent development platform, and on top of a (non-\\impact) geographic database\nagent. Based on these implementations, we conducted experiments and show that\nour algorithms are considerably more efficient than methods that use the $A^*$\nalgorithm."

A promising approach is the use of\nmulti-agent systems of information agents, which cooperatively solve advanced\ninformation-retrieval problems. This requires capabilities to address complex\ntasks, such as search and assessment of sources, query planning, information\nmerging and fusion, dealing with incomplete information, and handling of\ninconsistency. In this paper, our interest is in the role which some methods\nfrom the field of declarative logic programming can play in the realization of\nreasoning capabilities for information agents. In particular, we are interested\nin how they can be used and further developed for the specific needs of this\napplication domain. We review some existing systems and current projects, which\naddress information-integration problems. We then focus on declarative\nknowledge-representation methods, and review and evaluate approaches from logic\nprogramming and nonmonotonic reasoning for information agents.

The advice-exchange\ntechnique, discussed here, uses supervised learning (backpropagation), where\nreinforcement is not directly coming from the environment but is based on\nadvice given by peers with better performance score (higher confidence), to\nenhance the performance of a heterogeneous group of Learning Agents (LAs). The\nLAs are facing similar problems, in an environment where only reinforcement\ninformation is available. Each LA applies a different, well known, learning\ntechnique: Random Walk (hill-climbing), Simulated Annealing, Evolutionary\nAlgorithms and Q-Learning. The problem used for evaluation is a simplified\ntraffic-control simulation. Initial results indicate that advice-exchange can\nimprove learning speed, although bad advice and/or blind reliance can disturb\nthe learning performance."

The primary purpose\nof our work is to design a model that describes the different aspects a user\nmight be interested in considering when involved in a musical activity. The\napproach we suggest in this work enables the musician to encode his knowledge,\nintuitions, and aesthetic taste into different modules. The system captures\nthese aspects by computing and applying three distinct functions: rules, fuzzy\nconcepts, and learning.\n  As a case study, we began experimenting with first species two-part\ncounterpoint melodies.

Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start\nproblems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base\nrecommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide\nvaluable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such\nknowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests\nare particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the\nsynergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology\ncontaining information automatically extracted from departmental databases\navailable on the web.

    "summary": "Combinatorial auctions where agents can bid on bundles of items are desirable\nbecause they allow the agents to express complementarity and substitutability\nbetween the items. However, expressing one's preferences can require bidding on\nall bundles. Selective incremental preference elicitation by the auctioneer was\nrecently proposed to address this problem (Conen & Sandholm 2001), but the idea\nwas not evaluated. In this paper we show, experimentally and theoretically,\nthat automated elicitation provides a drastic benefit. In all of the\nelicitation schemes under study, as the number of items for sale increases, the\namount of information elicited is a vanishing fraction of the information\ncollected in traditional ``direct revelation mechanisms'' where bidders reveal\nall their valuation information. Most of the elicitation schemes also maintain\nthe benefit as the number of agents increases. We develop more effective\nelicitation policies for existing query types. We also present a new query type\nthat takes the incremental nature of elicitation to a new level by allowing\nagents to give approximate answers that are refined only on an as-needed basis.\nIn the process, we present methods for evaluating different types of\nelicitation policies."

    "summary": "Combining two or more items and selling them as one good, a practice called\nbundling, can be a very effective strategy for reducing the costs of producing,\nmarketing, and selling goods. In this paper, we consider a form of multi-issue\nnegotiation where a shop negotiates both the contents and the price of bundles\nof goods with his customers. We present some key insights about, as well as a\ntechnique for, locating mutually beneficial alternatives to the bundle\ncurrently under negotiation. The essence of our approach lies in combining\nhistorical sales data, condensed into aggregate knowledge, with current data\nabout the ongoing negotiation process, to exploit these insights. In\nparticular, when negotiating a given bundle of goods with a customer, the shop\nanalyzes the sequence of the customer's offers to determine the progress in the\nnegotiation process. In addition, it uses aggregate knowledge concerning\ncustomers' valuations of goods in general. We show how the shop can use these\ntwo sources of data to locate promising alternatives to the current bundle.\nWhen the current negotiation's progress slows down, the shop may suggest the\nmost promising of those alternatives and, depending on the customer's response,\ncontinue negotiating about the alternative bundle, or propose another\nalternative. Extensive computer simulation experiments show that our approach\nincreases the speed with which deals are reached, as well as the number and\nquality of the deals reached, as compared to a benchmark. In addition, we show\nthat the performance of our system is robust to a variety of changes in the\nnegotiation strategies employed by the customers."

This\ncoordination mechanism is interleaved with the motion strategy computation to\nreduce detections of the same target by more than one sensor. To avoid an\nexhaustive search in the joint space of all sensors the coordination mechanism\nconstraints the search by assigning priorities to the sensors.

A lot of interest has surfaced recently around self-*\n(self-organizing, self-managing, self-optimizing, self-protecting) agents. This\npaper presents polymorphic self-* agents that evolve a core set of roles and\nbehavior based on environmental cues. The agents adapt these roles based on the\nchanging demands of the environment, and are directly implementable in computer\nsystems applications. The design combines strategies from game theory,\nstigmergy, and other biologically inspired models to address fault mitigation\nin large-scale, real-time, distributed systems. The agents are embedded within\nthe individual digital signal processors of BTeV, a High Energy Physics\nexperiment consisting of 2500 such processors. Results obtained using a SWARM\nsimulation of the BTeV environment demonstrate the polymorphic character of the\nagents, and show how this design exceeds performance and reliability metrics\nobtained from comparable centralized, and even traditional decentralized\napproaches."

    "summary": "Simulations of artificial stock markets were considered as early as 1964 and\nmulti-agent ones were introduced as early as 1989. Starting the early 90's,\ncollaborations of economists and physicists produced increasingly realistic\nsimulation platforms. Currently, the market stylized facts are easily\nreproduced and one has now to address the realistic details of the Market\nMicrostructure and of the Traders Behaviour. This calls for new methods and\ntools capable of bridging smoothly between simulations and experiments in\neconomics.\n  We propose here the following Avatar-Based Method (ABM). The subjects\nimplement and maintain their Avatars (programs encoding their personal decision\nmaking procedures) on NatLab, a market simulation platform. Once these\nprocedures are fed in a computer edible format, they can be operationally used\nas such without the need for belabouring, interpreting or conceptualising them.\nThus ABM short-circuits the usual behavioural economics experiments that search\nfor the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjects behaviour. Finally,\nABM maintains a level of objectivity close to the classical behaviourism while\nextending its scope to subjects' decision making mechanisms.\n  We report on experiments where Avatars designed and maintained by humans from\ndifferent backgrounds (including real traders) compete in a continuous\ndouble-auction market. We hope this unbiased way of capturing the adaptive\nevolution of real subjects behaviour may lead to a new kind of behavioural\neconomics experiments with a high degree of reliability, analysability and\nreproducibility."

However, standard propositional logics for knowledge and\nawareness cannot express the fact that an agent knows that there are facts of\nwhich he is unaware without there being an explicit fact that the agent knows\nhe is unaware of. We propose a logic for reasoning about knowledge of\nunawareness, by extending Fagin and Halpern's \\emph{Logic of General\nAwareness}. The logic allows quantification over variables, so that there is a\nformula in the language that can express the fact that ``an agent explicitly\nknows that there exists a fact of which he is unaware''. Moreover, that formula\ncan be true without the agent explicitly knowing that he is unaware of any\nparticular formula. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization of the\nlogic, using standard axioms from the literature to capture the quantification\noperator. Finally, we show that the validity problem for the logic is\nrecursively enumerable, but not decidable."

    "summary": "Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems\noperating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their\nbehavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in\norder to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms\nfor task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication\nbetween robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a\nlack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult\nto design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic\ntask allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between\ntwo types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the\nabsence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the\nstate of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task\nto choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as\nstochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.\nSpecifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the\nchoice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The\nmathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The\nmodel's predictions agree very closely with experimental results from\nsensor-based simulations."

There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a\nstrand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an\nunfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which\nthe bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of\nmachine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes.\nA simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of\nunbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in\nthe soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the\npolygons drift together and bond to form a mesh.

These rules have\nbeen evaluated in several different situations (maps with different degree of\ndifficulty), and we have found that they yield better results than a greedy\nalgorithm (taken as baseline) in addition to a military behaviour that is also\nbetter in the tactical sense. The aggregative function, in general, yields\nbetter results than the one based on dominance."

    "summary": "Community structure identification has been one of the most popular research\nareas in recent years due to its applicability to the wide scale of\ndisciplines. To detect communities in varied topics, there have been many\nalgorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks to\nbe addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based community\ndetection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agents\nby forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the information\ncollected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the network\nstructure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining the\nnumber of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge about\nthe network such as number of the communities or any threshold values.\nFurthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result instead\nof giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, the\ncomputational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like working\nagents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types and\nsizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For all\nthree networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run."

Such microscopic machines, of sizes\ncomparable to bacteria, could simultaneously monitor entire populations of\ncells individually in vivo. This paper reviews plausible capabilities for\nmicroscopic robots and the physical constraints due to operation in fluids at\nlow Reynolds number, diffusion-limited sensing and thermal noise from Brownian\nmotion. Simple distributed controls are then presented in the context of\nprototypical biomedical tasks, which require control decisions on millisecond\ntime scales. The resulting behaviors illustrate trade-offs among speed,\naccuracy and resource use. A specific example is monitoring for patterns of\nchemicals in a flowing fluid released at chemically distinctive sites.\nInformation collected from a large number of such devices allows estimating\nproperties of cell-sized chemical sources in a macroscopic volume. The\nmicroscopic devices moving with the fluid flow in small blood vessels can\ndetect chemicals released by tissues in response to localized injury or\ninfection. We find the devices can readily discriminate a single cell-sized\nchemical source from the background chemical concentration, providing\nhigh-resolution sensing in both time and space. By contrast, such a source\nwould be difficult to distinguish from background when diluted throughout the\nblood volume as obtained with a blood sample."

    "summary": "This paper develops and compares two simple asynchronous distributed\nsearchlight scheduling algorithms for multiple robotic agents in nonconvex\npolygonal environments. A searchlight is a ray emitted by an agent which cannot\npenetrate the boundary of the environment. A point is detected by a searchlight\nif and only if the point is on the ray at some instant. Targets are points\nwhich can move continuously with unbounded speed. The objective of the proposed\nalgorithms is for the agents to coordinate the slewing (rotation about a point)\nof their searchlights in a distributed manner, i.e., using only local sensing\nand limited communication, such that any target will necessarily be detected in\nfinite time. The first algorithm we develop, called the DOWSS (Distributed One\nWay Sweep Strategy), is a distributed version of a known algorithm described\noriginally in 1990 by Sugihara et al \\cite{KS-IS-MY:90}, but it can be very\nslow in clearing the entire environment because only one searchlight may slew\nat a time. In an effort to reduce the time to clear the environment, we develop\na second algorithm, called the PTSS (Parallel Tree Sweep Strategy), in which\nsearchlights sweep in parallel if guards are placed according to an environment\npartition belonging to a class we call PTSS partitions. Finally, we discuss how\nDOWSS and PTSS could be combined with with deployment, or extended to\nenvironments with holes."

We provide direct evidence that\nfor five human activity patterns the timing of individual human actions follow\nnon-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events\nseparated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of\nhuman behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when\nindividuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the\ntasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few\nexperiencing very long waiting times. We discuss two queueing models that\ncapture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations\non the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the\nwaiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution with\nexponent alpha=3/2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length,\nresulting in alpha=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of\nthese two models to human activity patterns.

The objective is to minimize the power expenditure of each user\nsubject to satisfying individual user delay. We make the practical assumption\nthat the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of\nthe user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure\nof a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy\nunder for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown\nsystem statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest\ndetermining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on\nits channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm\nfor a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer\noccupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus\naddresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is\ndetermined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our\nsimulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is\nindeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the\nperformance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite\nlow."

AGGs, introduced by Bhat and Leyton-Brown, is a succinct representation\nof games that encapsulates both \"local\" dependencies as in graphical games, and\npartial indifference to other agents' identities as in anonymous games, which\noccur in many natural settings. This is achieved by specifying a graph on the\nset of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends\nonly on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the\naction graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing\nmixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of\nagent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness\nresults for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is\nunconstrained. In particular, we show that even if the action graph is a tree,\nbut the number of agent-types is unconstrained, it is NP-complete to decide the\nexistence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a\nmixed Nash equilibrium (even an approximate one); similarly for symmetric AGGs\n(all agents belong to a single type), if we allow arbitrary treewidth.

This provides an insight into system dynamics\nrather than just predicting the output of a system based on specific inputs.\nSimulation is not a decision making tool but a decision support tool, allowing\nbetter informed decisions to be made.

An optimization in terms of symmetry can be combined with the\nimplementation of higher and heterogeniously distributed walking speeds by\nrepresenting different walking speeds via different amounts of cells an agent\nmay move during one round. Therefore all different possible neighborhoods for\nspeeds up to v = 10 (cells per round) will be examined for the amount of\ndeviation from radial symmetry.

    "summary": "Several simulation environments exist for the simulation of large-scale\nevacuations of buildings, ships, or other enclosed spaces. These offer\nsophisticated tools for the study of human behaviour, the recreation of\nenvironmental factors such as fire or smoke, and the inclusion of architectural\nor structural features, such as elevators, pillars and exits. Although such\nsimulation environments can provide insights into crowd behaviour, they lack\nthe ability to examine potentially dangerous forces building up within a crowd.\nThese are commonly referred to as crush conditions, and are a common cause of\ndeath in emergency evacuations.\n  In this paper, we describe a methodology for the prediction and mitigation of\ncrush conditions. The paper is organised as follows. We first establish the\nneed for such a model, defining the main factors that lead to crush conditions,\nand describing several exemplar case studies. We then examine current methods\nfor studying crush, and describe their limitations. From this, we develop a\nthree-stage hybrid approach, using a combination of techniques. We conclude\nwith a brief discussion of the potential benefits of our approach."

Even when\nwe consider friendly environments and benevolent agents, cooperation involves\nseveral issues: with whom to cooperate, reciprocation, how to address credit\nassignment and complex division of gains, etc. We propose a model where\nheterogeneous agents cooperate by forming groups and formation of larger groups\nis promoted. Benefit of agents is proportional to the performance and the size\nof the group. There is a time pressure to form a group. We investigate how\npreferring similar or complement agents in group formation affects an agent's\nsuccess. Preferring complement in group formation is found to be better, yet\nthere is no need to push the strategy to the extreme since the effect of\ncomplementing partners is saturated."

The training of agents in a social context instead of a\nself-play environment is investigated. Agents that use the reinforcement\nlearning algorithms are trained in social settings. This mimics the way in\nwhich players of board games such as scrabble and chess mentor each other in\ntheir clubs. A Round Robin tournament and a modified Swiss tournament setting\nare used for the training. The agents trained using social settings are\ncompared to self play agents and results indicate that more robust agents\nemerge from the social training setting. Higher state space games can benefit\nfrom such settings as diverse set of agents will have multiple strategies that\nincrease the chances of obtaining more experienced players at the end of\ntraining. The Social Learning trained agents exhibit better playing experience\nthan self play agents. The modified Swiss playing style spawns a larger number\nof better playing agents as the population size increases."

    "summary": "This paper considers a non-cooperative game in which competing users sharing\na frequency-selective interference channel selfishly optimize their power\nallocation in order to improve their achievable rates. Previously, it was shown\nthat a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state information\ncan make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performance\ncompared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterative\nwater-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. This paper\ndiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its\nexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To\ncharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural\nequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the\ninvestigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash\nequilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of\nthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms\nto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.\nNumerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori\nknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the\nrequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that\nimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other\nparticipants in the water-filling game."

    "summary": "Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are funda- mental tasks for a\nset of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in distinguishing a unique\nrobot, called the leader. The latter aims in arranging the robots in the plane\nto form any given pattern. The solv- ability of both these tasks turns out to\nbe necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. In this paper, we study\nthe relationship between these two tasks in a model, called CORDA, wherein the\nrobots are weak in several aspects. In particular, they are fully asynchronous\nand they have no direct means of communication. They cannot remember any\nprevious observation nor computation performed in any previous step. Such\nrobots are said to be oblivious. The robots are also uniform and anonymous,\ni.e, they all have the same program using no global parameter (such as an\nidentity) allowing to differentiate any of them. Moreover, we assume that none\nof them share any kind of common coordinate mechanism or common sense of\ndirection and we discuss the influence of a common handedness (i.e.,\nchirality). In such a system, Flochini et al. proved in [11] that it is\npossible to elect a leader for n \\geq 3 robots if it is possible to form any\npattern for n \\geq 3. In this paper, we show that the converse is true for n\n\\geq 4 when the robots share a common handedness and for n \\geq 5 when they do\nnot. Thus, we deduce that with chirality (resp. without chirality) both\nproblems are equivalent for n \\geq 4 (resp. n \\geq 5) in CORDA."

We introduce the use\nof movement-signals (analogously to flight signals and bees waggle) as a mean\nto transfer messages, enabling the use of distributed algorithms among the\nrobots. We propose one-to-one deterministic movement protocols that implement\nexplicit communication. We first present protocols for synchronous robots. We\nbegin with a very simple coding protocol for two robots. Based on on this\nprotocol, we provide one-to-one communication for any system of n \\geq 2 robots\nequipped with observable IDs that agree on a common direction (sense of\ndirection). We then propose two solutions enabling one-to-one communication\namong anonymous robots. Since the robots are devoid of observable IDs, both\nprotocols build recognition mechanisms using the (weak) capabilities offered to\nthe robots. The first protocol assumes that the robots agree on a common\ndirection and a common handedness (chirality), while the second protocol\nassumes chirality only. Next, we show how the movements of robots can provide\nimplicit acknowledgments in asynchronous systems. We use this result to design\nasynchronous one-to-one communication with two robots only. Finally, we combine\nthis solution with the schemes developed in synchronous settings to fit the\ngeneral case of asynchronous one-to-one communication among any number of\nrobots. Our protocols enable the use of distributing algorithms based on\nmessage exchanges among swarms of Stigmergic robots. Furthermore, they provides\nrobots equipped with means of communication to overcome faults of their\ncommunication device."

There\nare many reasons for constructing such an agent, called general game management\nagent. This agent manages strategic interactions between other agents -\nplayers, natural or also artificial. The agent records the interaction for\nfurther benchmarking and analysis. He can also be used for a kind of restricted\ncommunications. His behavior is defined by a game description written in a\nlogic-based language. The language, we present for this application, is more\nexpressive than the language GDL, which is already used for such purposes. Our\nlanguage can represent imperfect information and time dependent elements of a\ngame. Time dependent elements like delays and timeouts are of crucial\nimportance for interactions between players with bounded processing power like\nhumans. We provide examples to show the feasibility of our approach. A way for\ngame theoretical solving of an interaction description in our language is\nconsidered as future work."

    "summary": "In a society of completely selfish individuals where everybody is only\ninterested in maximizing his own payoff, does any equilibrium exist for the\nsociety? John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always\nexists such that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy.\nNash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers a\nmathematical foundation for social science and economy. However, it is\nimportant from both a theoretical and a practical point of view to understand\ngame playing where individuals are less selfish. This paper offers a\nconstructive generalization of Nash equilibrium to study n-person games where\nthe selfishness of individuals can be defined at any level, including the\nextreme of complete selfishness. The generalization is constructive since it\noffers a protocol for individuals in a society to reach an equilibrium. Most\nimportantly, this paper presents experimental results and theoretical\ninvestigation to show that the individuals in a society can reduce their\nselfishness level together to reach a new equilibrium where they can have\nbetter payoffs and the society is more stable at the same time. This study\nsuggests that, for the benefit of everyone in a society (including the\nfinancial market), the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be\ncontrolled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed\nregulations."

Economists traditionally use mathematical methods,\nmainly game theory, to analyze auctions and design new auction forms. However,\ndue to the high complexity of auctions, the mathematical models are typically\nsimplified to obtain results, and this makes it difficult to apply results\nderived from such models to market environments in the real world.

    "summary": "Experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the\nstability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm as the\nnumber of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex.\nFor cooperative agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global\nmetric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the\nglobal performance metric over time. If the global metric improves and\neventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the\nsystem's stability.\n  The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better\nexperimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale\nadaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the\nstability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an\nunderlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in\nperformance. We then propose an alternative metric that relies on agents' local\npolicies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective\n(than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of\nMARL algorithms."

Our research work comes in this framework and aims to\ndevelop a DSS that must be generic as much as possible and independent from the\ncase study."

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of designing incentive compatible\nauctions for multiple (homogeneous) units of a good, when bidders have private\nvaluations and private budget constraints. When only the valuations are private\nand the budgets are public, Dobzinski {\\em et al} show that the {\\em adaptive\nclinching} auction is the unique incentive-compatible auction achieving\nPareto-optimality. They further show thatthere is no deterministic\nPareto-optimal auction with private budgets. Our main contribution is to show\nthe following Budget Monotonicity property of this auction: When there is only\none infinitely divisible good, a bidder cannot improve her utility by reporting\na budget smaller than the truth. This implies that a randomized modification to\nthe adaptive clinching auction is incentive compatible and Pareto-optimal with\nprivate budgets.\n  The Budget Monotonicity property also implies other improved results in this\ncontext. For revenue maximization, the same auction improves the best-known\ncompetitive ratio due to Abrams by a factor of 4, and asymptotically approaches\nthe performance of the optimal single-price auction.\n  Finally, we consider the problem of revenue maximization (or social welfare)\nin a Bayesian setting. We allow the bidders have public size constraints (on\nthe amount of good they are willing to buy) in addition to private budget\nconstraints. We show a simple poly-time computable 5.83-approximation to the\noptimal Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism, that is implementable in\ndominant strategies. Our technique again crucially needs the ability to prevent\nbidders from over-reporting budgets via randomization."

    "summary": "Requirement volatility is an issue in software engineering in general, and in\nWeb-based clinical applications in particular, which often originates from an\nincomplete knowledge of the domain of interest. With advances in the health\nscience, many features and functionalities need to be added to, or removed\nfrom, existing software applications in the biomedical domain. At the same\ntime, the increasing complexity of biomedical systems makes them more difficult\nto understand, and consequently it is more difficult to define their\nrequirements, which contributes considerably to their volatility. In this\npaper, we present a novel agent-based approach for analyzing and managing\nvolatile and dynamic requirements in an ontology-driven laboratory information\nmanagement system (LIMS) designed for Web-based case reporting in medical\nmycology. The proposed framework is empowered with ontologies and formalized\nusing category theory to provide a deep and common understanding of the\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirement hierarchies and their interrelations,\nand to trace the effects of a change on the conceptual framework."

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a bid optimizer for sponsored keyword search\nauctions which leads to better retention of advertisers by yielding attractive\nutilities to the advertisers without decreasing the revenue to the search\nengine. The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search\nengine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm\ntransforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a\ncorrelated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The\nalgorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine\nand the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating\nthe characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the\nplayers involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the\ncharacteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of\nallocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the\nadvertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid\nprofile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a\nstandard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the\nallocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The\ncorrelated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and\nalso a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game. Through detailed\nsimulation experiments, we show that the proposed bid optimizer retains more\ncustomers than a plain GSP mechanism and also yields better long-run utilities\nto the search engine and the advertisers."

We wish to design mechanisms that are\nstrategyproof, in the sense that agents can never benefit by lying, or, even\nbetter, group strategyproof, in the sense that a coalition of agents cannot all\nbenefit by lying. At the same time, our mechanisms must provide a small\napproximation ratio with respect to one of two optimization targets: the social\ncost or the maximum cost.\n  We give an almost complete characterization of the feasible truthful\napproximation ratio under both target functions, deterministic and randomized\nmechanisms, and with respect to different network topologies. Our main results\nare: We show that a simple randomized mechanism is group strategyproof and\ngives a (2-2/n)-approximation for the social cost, where n is the number of\nagents, when the network is a circle (known as a ring in the case of computer\nnetworks); we design a novel \"hybrid\" strategyproof randomized mechanism that\nprovides a tight approximation ratio of 3/2 for the maximum cost when the\nnetwork is a circle; and we show that no randomized SP mechanism can provide an\napproximation ratio better than 2-o(1) to the maximum cost even when the\nnetwork is a tree, thereby matching a trivial upper bound of two."

We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted\nmigration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent\noptimisation of the agent migration patterns.

However, as spot markets for display ads, such as the\nRightMedia Exchange, have grown in prominence, the selection of advertisements\nto show on a given page is increasingly being chosen based on price, using an\nauction. As the number of participants in the exchange grows, the price of an\nimpressions becomes a signal of its value. This correlation between price and\nvalue means that a seller implementing the contract through bidding should\noffer the contract buyer a range of prices, and not just the cheapest\nimpressions necessary to fulfill its demand.\n  Implementing a contract using a range of prices, is akin to creating a mutual\nfund of advertising impressions, and requires {\\em randomized bidding}. We\ncharacterize what allocations can be implemented with randomized bidding,\nnamely those where the desired share obtained at each price is a non-increasing\nfunction of price.

On the other hand, this class of games does not model well the\ncongestion or resource sharing in a wireless context, a prominent feature of\nwhich is spatial reuse. What this translates to in the context of a congestion\ngame is that a users payoff for using a resource (interpreted as a channel) is\na function of the its number of its interfering users sharing that channel,\nrather than the total number among all users.

    "summary": "Submodular functions are an important class of functions in combinatorial\noptimization which satisfy the natural properties of decreasing marginal costs.\nThe study of these functions has led to strong structural properties with\napplications in many areas. Recently, there has been significant interest in\nextending the theory of algorithms for optimizing combinatorial problems (such\nas network design problem of spanning tree) over submodular functions.\nUnfortunately, the lower bounds under the general class of submodular functions\nare known to be very high for many of the classical problems.\n  In this paper, we introduce and study an important subclass of submodular\nfunctions, which we call discounted price functions. These functions are\nsuccinctly representable and generalize linear cost functions. In this paper we\nstudy the following fundamental combinatorial optimization problems: Edge\nCover, Spanning Tree, Perfect Matching and Shortest Path, and obtain tight\nupper and lower bounds for these problems.\n  The main technical contribution of this paper is designing novel adaptive\ngreedy algorithms for the above problems. These algorithms greedily build the\nsolution whist rectifying mistakes made in the previous steps."

    "summary": "Urban transportation is a complex phenomenon. Since many agents are\nconstantly interacting in parallel, it is difficult to predict the future state\nof a transportation system. Because of this, optimization techniques tend to\ngive obsolete solutions, as the problem changes before it can be optimized. An\nalternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved\nwith self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the\nelements of the system follow local rules to achieve a global solution. Like\nthis, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new\nconfiguration.\n  In this chapter, I will review recent, current, and future work on\nself-organizing transportation systems. Self-organizing traffic lights have\nproven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public\ntransportation systems, simple rules are being explored to prevent the \"equal\nheadway instability\" phenomenon. The methods we have used can be also applied\nto other urban transportation systems and their generality is discussed."

    "summary": "Background: Many different simulation frameworks, in different topics, need\nto treat realistic datasets to initialize and calibrate the system. A precise\nreproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable\nforecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by\ntheir age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical\nconstraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head,\ndifference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a\npopulation is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)\nindividual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often\nvery important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic\nevolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different\nsources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number\nof combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants)\nmakes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we\ndeveloped a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable.\nConclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot\nmunicipalities in Auvergne region (France), to illustrate the approach. The\ngenerated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical\ndatasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable\ncomputational time."

    "summary": "Using mobile robots for autonomous patrolling of environments to prevent\nintrusions is a topic of increasing practical relevance. One of the most\nchallenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling\nstrategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers\nin order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this\nproblem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly\nconsidering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that\nof modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the\nintruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective\npatrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal\nframework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends\nthe previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments\nwith arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main\noriginal contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game\nfor generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic\nequilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,\nand an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is\na set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph. Both\nthe algorithms are analytically studied and experimentally validated, to assess\ntheir properties and efficiency."

The goal of\nthe game is to reach a consensus about naming these objects. Originally used to\ninvestigate language formation and self-organizing vocabularies, we extend the\nclassical naming game with a globally shared memory accessible by all agents.\nThis shared memory can be interpreted as an external source of knowledge like a\nbook or an Internet site. The extended naming game models an environment\nsimilar to one that can be found in the context of social bookmarking and\ncollaborative tagging sites where users tag sites using appropriate labels, but\nalso mimics an important aspect in the field of human-based image labeling.\nAlthough the extended naming game is non-deterministic in its word selection,\nwe show that consensus towards a common vocabulary is reached. More\nimportantly, we show the qualitative and quantitative influence of the external\nsource of information, i.e. the shared memory, on the consensus dynamics\nbetween the agents."

As a case study we have chosen the retail\nsector, and here in particular the operations of the fitting room in the women\nwear department of a large UK department store. In our case study we looked at\nways of determining the efficiency of implementing new management policies for\nthe fitting room operation through modelling the reactive behaviour of staff\nand customers of the department. First, we have carried out a validation\nexperiment in which we compared the results from our models to the performance\nof the real system. This experiment also allowed us to establish differences in\noutput accuracy between the two modelling methids. In a second step a\nmulti-scenario experiment was carried out to study the behaviour of the models\nwhen they are used for the purpose of operational improvement.

In this paper, we propose a\nfully decentralized algorithm that iteratively modifies the structure of a\nnetwork of agents in order to control the moments of the Laplacian eigenvalue\nspectrum. Although the individual agents have knowledge of their local network\nstructure only (i.e., myopic information), they are collectively able to\naggregate this local information and decide on what links are most beneficial\nto be added or removed at each time step. Our approach relies on gossip\nalgorithms to distributively compute the spectral moments of the Laplacian\nmatrix, as well as ensure network connectivity in the presence of link\ndeletions. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations and\nshow that a good final approximation of the spectral moments of the target\nLaplacian matrix is achieved for many cases of interest."

At each step, an individual can decide if it\nchanges groups or interact on its opinion with one of its internal or external\nneighbour. If it decides to look at the group level, it changes groups if its\nopinion is far from the average of its group from more than a threshold. If it\nis the case, it joins the group which has proportionally the closest average\nopinion from its. If it decides to interact with one of its neighbour, it\nbecomes closer in opinion to it when its opinion and the one of the\nselected-to-interact neighbour are less distant from the threshold. From the\nstudy of this coupled model, we discover some surprising behaviours compared to\nthe known behaviour of the Deffuant bounded confidence model(BC): The coupled\nmodel exhibits a total consensus for an threshold value lower than the BC\nmodel; the distribution of sizes of the groups changes: some groups become\nlarger while other decrease in size, sometimes until containing only one\nindividual; from the point of view of the groups, the consensus remains for a\nlarge set of threshold values while, looking at the population level, there are\na lot of opinion clusters."

We give an algorithm to\nensure fairness in a CAS using a Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). We use an\nalgorithm of Sandholm to achieve optimality. Basic and extended fairness are\nthen analyzed according to the dominant strategy solution concept."

    "summary": "A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a cooperative engagement of a collection of\nmobile nodes without any centralized access point or infrastructure to\ncoordinate among the peers. The underlying concept of coordination among nodes\nin a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to\nissues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network\ntopology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management\npoint, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed\napproach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that\ncombines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a\nMANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior,\nhence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture\nas the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally\nnor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self\nobservation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need\nof a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense\nthat it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path\nManager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our\nsystem outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing\noverhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious.\nVarious parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update\nvalues, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over\nseveral simulation test runs of the system. By combining the semi-distributed\narchitecture and other design essentials like path manager, monitor module,\nredemption and fading concepts; Our system proves to be robust enough to\ncounter most common attacks in MANETs."

Our framework is general enough to\ncover a wide range of application scenarios, and it has advantages over\nexisting approaches such as Stackelberg strategies and pricing.

    "summary": "Bargaining networks model social or economic situations in which agents seek\nto form the most lucrative partnership with another agent from among several\nalternatives. There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash\nbargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,\nso that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be\ncomputed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced\nin [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)\nsolutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a\ncertain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the\nbound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network\nsize for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a\ngraph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly\nbounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \\eps-UD solution in time\npoly(|V|,1/\\eps). We also provide a fast local algorithm for finding \\eps-UD\nsolution, providing further justification that a market can find such a\nsolution."

    "summary": "In our previous work [1], a divide-and-conquer approach was proposed for\ncooperative tasking among multi-agent systems. The basic idea is to decompose a\nrequested global specification into subtasks for individual agents such that\nthe fulfillment of these subtasks by each individual agent leads to the\nsatisfaction of the global specification as a team. It was shown that not all\ntasks can be decomposed. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition was\nproposed for the decomposability of a task automaton between two cooperative\nagents. The current paper continues the results in [1] and proposes necessary\nand sufficient conditions for task decomposability with respect to arbitrary\nfinite number of agents. It is further shown that the fulfillment of local\nspecifications can guarantee the satisfaction of the global specification. This\nwork provides hints for the designers on how to rule out the indecomposable\ntask automata and enforce the decomposability conditions. The result therefore\nmay pave the way towards a new perspective for decentralized cooperative\ncontrol of multi-agent systems."

As a population-based\nalgorithm, its computation is intrinsically massively parallel, and it is\nthere- fore theoretically well-suited for implementation on Graphics Processing\nUnits (GPUs). The ACO algorithm comprises two main stages: Tour construction\nand Pheromone update. The former has been previously implemented on the GPU,\nusing a task-based parallelism approach. However, up until now, the latter has\nalways been implemented on the CPU. In this paper, we discuss several\nparallelisation strategies for both stages of the ACO algorithm on the GPU. We\npropose an alternative data-based parallelism scheme for Tour construction,\nwhich fits better on the GPU architecture. We also describe novel GPU\nprogramming strategies for the Pheromone update stage. Our results show a total\nspeed-up exceeding 28x for the Tour construction stage, and 20x for Pheromone\nupdate, and suggest that ACO is a potentially fruitful area for future research\nin the GPU domain."

To protect\nelections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been\ninvestigated and the corresponding NP-hardness results are termed \"resistance.\"\nIt has been a long-running project of research in this area to classify the\nmajor voting systems in terms of their resistance properties. We show that\nfallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to\ncombine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types\nof control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters.\nThus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known\nto hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem.\nWe also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it\nperforms at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control\nresistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each\nresistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance\nfor fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an\nindication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In\npractice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical\ninstances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and\nfallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be\nsmall for typical instances. Our results, though still in the worst-case\ncomplexity model, can be interpreted as significant strengthenings of the\nresistance demonstrations based on NP-hardness."

We\ncharacterize the domain-independent challenges posed by this problem, and\ndescribe how properties of domains influence the challenges and their\nsolutions. We will concentrate on dynamic, data-rich domains where humans are\nultimately responsible for team behavior. Thus, the automated aid should\ninteractively support effective and timely decision making by the human. We\npresent a domain-independent categorization of the types of alerts a plan-based\nmonitoring system might issue to a user, where each type generally requires\ndifferent monitoring techniques. We describe a monitoring framework for\nintegrating many domain-specific and task-specific monitoring techniques and\nthen using the concept of value of an alert to avoid operator overload. We use\nthis framework to describe an execution monitoring approach we have used to\nimplement Execution Assistants (EAs) in two different dynamic, data-rich,\nreal-world domains to assist a human in monitoring team behavior. One domain\n(Army small unit operations) has hundreds of mobile, geographically distributed\nagents, a combination of humans, robots, and vehicles. The other domain (teams\nof unmanned ground and air vehicles) has a handful of cooperating robots. Both\ndomains involve unpredictable adversaries in the vicinity. Our approach\ncustomizes monitoring behavior for each specific task, plan, and situation, as\nwell as for user preferences. Our EAs alert the human controller when reported\nevents threaten plan execution or physically threaten team members. Alerts were\ngenerated in a timely manner without inundating the user with too many alerts\n(less than 10 percent of alerts are unwanted, as judged by domain experts)."

    "summary": "Multiagent learning is a necessary yet challenging problem as multiagent\nsystems become more prevalent and environments become more dynamic. Much of the\ngroundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory, in\nparticular, the concept of Nash equilibria. Learners that directly learn an\nequilibrium obviously rely on their existence. Learners that instead seek to\nplay optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria\nsince equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,\nagents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical\nlimitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction\nand approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article\nexplores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and\nlimitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria\ncontinue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects\nlimitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of\nequilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we\nmake three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence\nof equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that\npreserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations\nthat satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a\nspecific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of\nlimited agents. These results demonstrate that learning with limitations is\nfeasible, when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold."

In this work, we study the\ndissemination of a \\emph{single} content (e.g., an item of news, a song or a\nvideo clip) among a population of mobile nodes. Each node in the population is\neither a \\emph{destination} (interested in the content) or a potential\n\\emph{relay} (not yet interested in the content). There is an interest\nevolution process by which nodes not yet interested in the content (i.e.,\nrelays) can become interested (i.e., become destinations) on learning about the\npopularity of the content (i.e., the number of already interested nodes). In\nour work, the interest in the content evolves under the \\emph{linear threshold\nmodel}. The content is copied between nodes when they make random contact. For\nthis we employ a controlled epidemic spread model. We model the joint evolution\nof the copying process and the interest evolution process, and derive the joint\nfluid limit ordinary differential equations.

There is an inherent tradeoff between how general a\nlanguage is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is\ncomputationally to optimize and solve such games. One prominent such language\nis the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation [14],\nwhich maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge\nweighted graph.\n  We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs.\nThe agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition\nis the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The\noptimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that\nmaximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding\nthe optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is\nalso intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are\namenable for many other combinatorial problems.

    "summary": "The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was one of the first great civilizations\nin prehistory. This bronze age civilization flourished from the end of the\nfourth millennium BC. It disintegrated during the second millennium BC; despite\nmuch research effort, this decline is not well understood. Less research has\nbeen devoted to the emergence of the IVC, which shows continuous cultural\nprecursors since at least the seventh millennium BC. To understand the decline,\nwe believe it is necessary to investigate the rise of the IVC, i.e., the\nestablishment of agriculture and livestock, dense populations and technological\ndevelopments 7000--3000 BC. Although much archaeological information is\navailable, our capability to investigate the system is hindered by poorly\nresolved chronology, and by a lack of field work in the intermediate areas\nbetween the Indus valley and Mesopotamia. We thus employ a complementary\nnumerical simulation to develop a consistent picture of technology,\nagropastoralism and population developments in the IVC domain. Results from\nthis Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator show that there is\n(1) fair agreement between the simulated timing of the agricultural transition\nand radiocarbon dates from early agricultural sites, but the transition is\nsimulated first in India then Pakistan; (2) an independent agropastoralism\ndeveloping on the Indian subcontinent; and (3) a positive relationship between\narcheological artifact richness and simulated population density which remains\nto be quantified."

Now, there are a number of different procedures that can be\nused for this process; the three main ones being the package deal procedure in\nwhich all the issues are bundled and discussed together, the simultaneous\nprocedure in which the issues are discussed simultaneously but independently of\neach other, and the sequential procedure in which the issues are discussed one\nafter another. Since each of them yields a different outcome, a key problem is\nto decide which one to use in which circumstances. Specifically, we consider\nthis question for a model in which the agents have time constraints (in the\nform of both deadlines and discount factors) and information uncertainty (in\nthat the agents do not know the opponents utility function). For this model, we\nconsider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and\ndetermine equilibria for each case for each procedure. In so doing, we show\nthat the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then\ngo on to show that, although the package deal may be computationally more\ncomplex than the other two procedures, it generates Pareto optimal outcomes\n(unlike the other two), it has similar earliest and latest possible times of\nagreement to the simultaneous procedure (which is better than the sequential\nprocedure), and that it (like the other two procedures) generates a unique\noutcome only under certain conditions (which we define)."

    "summary": "A Multi-Agent System is a distributed system where the agents or nodes\nperform complex functions that cannot be written down in analytic form.\nMulti-Agent Systems are highly connected, and the information they contain is\nmostly stored in the connections. When agents update their state, they take\ninto account the state of the other agents, and they have access to those\nstates via the connections. There is also external, user-generated input into\nthe Multi-Agent System. As so much information is stored in the connections,\nagents are often memory-less. This memory-less property, together with the\nrandomness of the external input, has allowed us to model Multi-Agent Systems\nusing Markov chains. In this paper, we look at Multi-Agent Systems that evolve,\ni.e. the number of agents varies according to the fitness of the individual\nagents. We extend our Markov chain model, and define stability. This is the\nstart of a methodology to control Multi-Agent Systems. We then build upon this\nto construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability (entropy\nof the limit probabilities), which we used to perform a stability analysis. We\nthen investigated the stability of evolving agent populations through\nsimulation, and show that the results are consistent with the original\ndefinition of stability in non-evolving Multi-Agent Systems, proposed by Chli\nand De Wilde. This paper forms the theoretical basis for the construction of\nDigital Business Ecosystems, and applications have been reported elsewhere."

On the other side, it is predicted\nthat using multimedia applications will be more public in these network. As it\nis known, in contrary to best-effort flows, the transmission of multimedia\nflows in any network need support from QoS. However, the wireless ad hoc\nnetworks are severely affected by bandwidth, and establishing a QoS in these\nnetworks face problems. In this paper, we have proposed a thoroughly\ndistributed algorithm to support the QoS in ad hoc networks. This algorithm\nguarantees the QoS of the real-time applications vis-a-vis each other and\nbest-effort flows as well. The algorithm suggested in this paper dynamically\nregulates the Contention Window of the flows and serves the flows in terms of\ntheir requests QoS choosing the smallest CW in every node. This algorithm also\nuses the fixed and/or less stationary nodes for the transmission of real-time\nflows by increasing the QoS of the multimedia flows. This algorithm is\npreferred because it prioritizes the flows that are of the same class but have\nnot obtained favorite QoS compared to other flows of the same class in addition\nto classifying the flows in the network and offering better services to the\nclasses of higher priority. All this occur without the controlled packets\nforwarding and resource reserving and freeing method. We have proved the\ncorrectness of this algorithm using Markov's mathematical model."

    "summary": "This article presents a new algorithm which is a modified version of the\nelite ant system (EAS) algorithm. The new version utilizes an effective\ncriterion for escaping from the local optimum points. In contrast to the\nclassical EAC algorithms, the proposed algorithm uses only a global updating,\nwhich will increase pheromone on the edges of the best (i.e. the shortest)\nroute and will at the same time decrease the amount of pheromone on the edges\nof the worst (i.e. the longest) route. In order to assess the efficiency of the\nnew algorithm, some standard traveling salesman problems (TSPs) were studied\nand their results were compared with classical EAC and other well-known\nmeta-heuristic algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has\nbeen able to improve the efficiency of the algorithms in all instances and it\nis competitive with other algorithms."

    "summary": "Achieving joint objectives by teams of cooperative planning agents requires\nsignificant coordination and communication efforts. For a single-agent system\nfacing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair\nthe failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms\nof time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication\ncomplexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication\noverhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in\ndecentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint\nobjectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower\ncommunication overhead than replanning from scratch.\n  The contribution of the presented paper is threefold. Firstly, we formally\nintroduce the multi-agent plan repair problem and formally present the core\nhypothesis underlying our work. Secondly, we propose three algorithms for\nmulti-agent plan repair reducing the problem to specialized instances of the\nmulti-agent planning problem. Finally, we present results of experimental\nvalidation confirming the core hypothesis of the paper."

In\nthis paper, assuming n > 1 disoriented anonymous sensors, we provide a complete\ncharac- terization on the sensors positions to deterministically elect a\nleader, provided that all the sensors' positions are known by every sensor.\nMore precisely, our contribution is twofold: First, assuming n anonymous\nsensors agreeing on a common handedness (chirality) of their own coordinate\nsystem, we provide a complete characterization on the sensors positions to\ndeterministically elect a leader. Second, we also provide such a complete\nchararacterization for sensors devoided of a common handedness.

    "summary": "Model checking verifies that a model of a system satisfies a given property,\nand otherwise produces a counter-example explaining the violation. The verified\nproperties are formally expressed in temporal logics. Some temporal logics,\nsuch as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole\ncomputation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.\nThis branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal\nlogics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition\nrelations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and\nepistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce\nlinear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation\npath of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially\nexplained by a linear counter-example.\n  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like\nannotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL\n(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions\nlabeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching\nstructure that supports more complete description of property violations.\nElements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to\ngive a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of\nthese richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of\nbranches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties.\n  This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate\ncounter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation\nalgorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples\nin CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been\nimplemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export\nbranching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical\ninterface to visualize and browse them."

Therefore we require a\nsystem which changes as per the changing requirements. Multi agent system\ntechnology in recent times has emerged as a possible way of efficient solution\nimplementation for many such complex problems. Our research here focuses on\nbuilding a Multi Agent System (MAS), which implements a modified version of\nGravitational Search swarm intelligence Algorithm (GSA) to find out an optimal\nstrategy in managing the demand supply chain. We target the grains distribution\nsystem among various centers of Food Corporation of India (FCI) as application\ndomain. We assume centers with larger stocks as objects of greater mass and\nvice versa. Applying Newtonian law of gravity as suggested in GSA, larger\nobjects attract objects of smaller mass towards itself, creating a virtual\ngrain supply source. As heavier object sheds its mass by supplying some to the\none in demand, it loses its gravitational pull and thus keeps the whole system\nof supply chain per-fectly in balance. The multi agent system helps in\ncontinuous updation of the whole system with the help of autonomous agents\nwhich react to the change in environment and act accordingly.

We study stationary routing policy (the probability vector\nis constant) as well as adaptive routing policies (the probability vector\nvaries in time as a function of the likelihood of regional anomalies). In the\ncontext of stationary policies, we design a performance metric and minimize it\nto design an efficient stationary routing policy. Our adaptive policy improves\nupon the stationary counterpart by adaptively increasing the selection\nprobability of regions with high likelihood of anomaly. Finally, we show the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations and a\npersistent surveillance experiment."

    "summary": "Classical approaches for asymptotic convergence to the global average in a\ndistributed fashion typically assume timely and reliable exchange of\ninformation between neighboring components of a given multi-component system.\nThese assumptions are not necessarily valid in practical settings due to\nvarying delays that might affect transmissions at different times, as well as\npossible changes in the underlying interconnection topology (e.g., due to\ncomponent mobility). In this work, we propose protocols to overcome these\nlimitations. We first consider a fixed interconnection topology (captured by a\n- possibly directed - graph) and propose a discrete-time protocol that can\nreach asymptotic average consensus in a distributed fashion, despite the\npresence of arbitrary (but bounded) delays in the communication links. The\nprotocol requires that each component has knowledge of the number of its\noutgoing links (i.e., the number of components to which it sends information).\nWe subsequently extend the protocol to also handle changes in the underlying\ninterconnection topology and describe a variety of rather loose conditions\nunder which the modified protocol allows the components to reach asymptotic\naverage consensus. The proposed algorithms are illustrated via examples."

    "summary": "Congestion games model a wide variety of real-world resource congestion\nproblems, such as selfish network routing, traffic route guidance in congested\nareas, taxi fleet optimization and crowd movement in busy areas. However,\nexisting research in congestion games assumes: (a) deterministic movement of\nagents between resources; and (b) perfect rationality (i.e. maximizing their\nown expected value) of all agents. Such assumptions are not reasonable in\ndynamic domains where decision support has to be provided to humans. For\ninstance, in optimizing the performance of a taxi fleet serving a city,\nmovement of taxis can be involuntary or nondeterministic (decided by the\nspecific customer who hires the taxi) and more importantly, taxi drivers may\nnot follow advice provided by the decision support system (due to bounded\nrationality of humans). To that end, we contribute: (a) a general framework for\nrepresenting congestion games under uncertainty for populations with assorted\nnotions of rationality. (b) a scalable approach for solving the decision\nproblem for perfectly rational agents which are in the mix with boundedly\nrational agents; and (c) a detailed evaluation on a synthetic and realworld\ndata set to illustrate the usefulness of our new approach with respect to key\nsocial welfare metrics in the context of an assorted human-agent population. An\ninteresting result from our experiments on a real-world taxi fleet optimization\nproblem is that it is better (in terms of revenue and operational efficiency)\nfor taxi drivers to follow perfectly rational strategies irrespective of the\npercentage of drivers not following the advice."

Due to the\nvulnerable nature of wireless communication against interference and\nintentional jamming, ITS face new challenges to ensure the reliability and the\nsafety of the overall system. In this paper, we expose a class of stealthy\nattacks -- Stuck in Traffic (SiT) attacks -- that aim to cause congestion by\nexploiting how drivers make decisions based on smart traffic signs. An attacker\nmounting a SiT attack solves a Markov Decision Process problem to find\noptimal/suboptimal attack policies in which he/she interferes with a\nwell-chosen subset of signals that are based on the state of the system. We\napply Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms to derive potent attack\npolicies. We evaluate their performance on a number of systems and compare them\nto other attack policies including random, myopic and DoS attack policies. The\ngenerated policies, albeit suboptimal, are shown to significantly outperform\nother attack policies as they maximize the expected cumulative reward from the\nstandpoint of the attacker."

No central machine governs the behaviors of the various\nprincipals.\n  We introduce Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering (IOSE) as an approach\nexpressly suited to the needs of open sociotechnical systems. In IOSE,\nspecifying a system amounts to specifying the interactions among the principals\nas protocols.

Swarm computation\nhas previously been used to explore how spatiotemporal complexity can emerge\nfrom, and be distributed within, simple component parts and their interactions.\nUsing a particle based swarm approach we explore the question of how to\ngenerate collective amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component\nparts in a model of P. polycephalum. The model collective behaves as a cohesive\nand deformable virtual material, approximating the local coupling within the\nplasmodium matrix. The collective generates de-novo and complex oscillatory\npatterns from simple local interactions. The origin of this motor behaviour is\ndistributed within the collective rendering is morphologically adaptive,\namenable to external influence, and robust to simulated environmental insult.\nWe show how to gain external influence over the collective movement by\nsimulated chemo-attraction (pulling towards nutrient stimuli) and simulated\nlight irradiation hazards (pushing from stimuli). The amorphous and distributed\nproperties of the collective are demonstrated by cleaving it into two\nindependent entities and fusing two separate entities to form a single device,\nthus enabling it to traverse narrow, separate or tortuous paths. We conclude by\nsummarising the contribution of the model to swarm based robotics and\nsoft-bodied modular robotics and discuss the future potential of such material\napproaches to the field."

These are usually done by comparing measured\nproperties of the dynamics found in observation, experiments and simulation in\ncertain scenarios. For this the scenarios first need to be sensitive to\nparameter changes of a particular model or - if models are compared -\ndifferences between models. Second it is helpful if the exhibited differences\ncan be expressed in quantities which are as simple as possible ideally a single\nnumber. Such a scenario is proposed in this contribution together with\nevaluation measures. In an example evaluation of a particular model it is shown\nthat the proposed evaluation measures are very sensitive to parameter changes\nand therefore summarize differences effects of parameter changes and\ndifferences between models efficiently, sometimes in a single number. It is\nshown how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed\nexample scenario is broken in particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral\ndynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there is a symmetry\nbetween left- and right-chiral dynamics. In the course of the symmetry breaking\ndifferences between models and parameter settings are amplified which is the\norigin of the high sensitivity of the scenario against parameter changes."

It is assumed\nthat there is a central agent that solicits recommendations or plans from other\nagents. That agent the n determines the consensus of the other agents, and\nchooses the resultant consensus recommendation or plan. Voting schemes such as\nthis have been used in a variety of domains, including air traffic control.\nThis paper uses an analytic model to study the use of consensus in multiple\nagent systems. The binomial model is used to study the probability that the\nconsensus judgment is correct or incorrect. That basic model is extended to\naccount for both different levels of agent competence and unequal prior odds.\nThe analysis of that model is critical in the investigation of multiple agent\nsystems, since the model leads us to conclude that in some cases consensus\njudgment is not appropriate. In addition, the results allow us to determine how\nmany agents should be used to develop consensus decisions, which agents should\nbe used to develop consensus decisions and under which conditions the consensus\nmodel should be used."

We formulate and solve\nthree problems representing three different Q-learning algorithms: namely,\ncentralized, distributed and partially distributed power control using\nQ-learning (CPC-Q, DPC-Q and PDPC-Q). CPCQ, although not of practical interest,\ncharacterizes the global optimum. Each of DPC-Q and PDPC-Q works in two\ndifferent learning paradigms: Independent (IL) and Cooperative (CL). The former\nis considered the simplest form for applying Qlearning in multi-agent\nscenarios, where all the femtocells learn independently. The latter is the\nproposed scheme in which femtocells share partial information during the\nlearning process in order to strike a balance between practical relevance and\nperformance. In terms of performance, the simulation results showed that the CL\nparadigm outperforms the IL paradigm and achieves an aggregate femtocells\ncapacity that is very close to the optimal one. For the practical relevance\nissue, we evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in real time, by\ndeploying new femtocells in the system during the learning process, where we\nshowed that DPC-Q in the CL paradigm is scalable to large number of femtocells\nand more robust to the network dynamics compared to the IL paradigm"

    "summary": "Studies related to crowds of pedestrians, both those of theoretical nature\nand application oriented ones, have generally focused on either the analysis or\nthe synthesis of the phenomena related to the interplay between individual\npedestrians, each characterised by goals, preferences and potentially relevant\nrelationships with others, and the environment in which they are situated. The\ncases in which these activities have been systematically integrated for a\nmutual benefit are still very few compared to the corpus of crowd related\nliterature. This paper presents a case study of an integrated approach to the\ndefinition of an innovative model for pedestrian and crowd simulation (on the\nside of synthesis) that was actually motivated and supported by the analyses of\nempirical data acquired from both experimental settings and observations in\nreal world scenarios. In particular, we will introduce a model for the adaptive\nbehaviour of pedestrians that are also members of groups, that strive to\nmaintain their cohesion even in difficult (e.g. high density) situations. The\npaper will show how the synthesis phase also provided inputs to the analysis of\nempirical data, in a virtuous circle."

We propose\na distributed online data classification framework where data is gathered by\ndistributed data sources and processed by a heterogeneous set of distributed\nlearners which learn online, at run-time, how to classify the different data\nstreams either by using their locally available classification functions or by\nhelping each other by classifying each other's data. Importantly, since the\ndata is gathered at different locations, sending the data to another learner to\nprocess incurs additional costs such as delays, and hence this will be only\nbeneficial if the benefits obtained from a better classification will exceed\nthe costs. We assume that the classification functions available to each\nprocessing element are fixed, but their prediction accuracy for various types\nof incoming data are unknown and can change dynamically over time, and thus\nthey need to be learned online. We model the problem of joint classification by\nthe distributed and heterogeneous learners from multiple data sources as a\ndistributed contextual bandit problem where each data is characterized by a\nspecific context.

Further on, this\nmethodology has a strong theoretical and formal basis realizing distributed\nsystems; any process is defined as a network of independent and distributed\nagents - i.e. instances of subjects - which coordinate work through the\nexchange of messages.

    "summary": "In a multi-agent system, agents coordinate to achieve global tasks through\nlocal communications. Coordination usually requires sufficient information\nflow, which is usually depicted by the connectivity of the communication\nnetwork. In a networked system, removal of some agents may cause a\ndisconnection. In order to maintain connectivity in agent removal, one can\ndesign a robust network topology that tolerates a finite number of agent\nlosses, and/or develop a control strategy that recovers connectivity. This\npaper proposes a decentralized control scheme based on a sequence of\nreplacements, each of which occurs between an agent and one of its immediate\nneighbors. The replacements always end with an agent, whose relocation does not\ncause a disconnection. We show that such an agent can be reached by a local\nrule utilizing only some local information available in agents' immediate\nneighborhoods. As such, the proposed message passing strategy guarantees the\nconnectivity maintenance in arbitrary agent removal. Furthermore, we\nsignificantly improve the optimality of the proposed scheme by incorporating\n$\\delta$-criticality (i.e. the criticality of an agent in its\n$\\delta$-neighborhood)."

    "summary": "To achieve an optimal outcome in many situations, agents need to choose\ndistinct actions from one another. This is the case notably in many resource\nallocation problems, where a single resource can only be used by one agent at a\ntime. How shall a designer of a multi-agent system program its identical agents\nto behave each in a different way? From a game theoretic perspective, such\nsituations lead to undesirable Nash equilibria. For example consider a resource\nallocation game in that two players compete for an exclusive access to a single\nresource. It has three Nash equilibria. The two pure-strategy NE are efficient,\nbut not fair. The one mixed-strategy NE is fair, but not efficient. Aumanns\nnotion of correlated equilibrium fixes this problem: It assumes a correlation\ndevice that suggests each agent an action to take. However, such a \"smart\"\ncoordination device might not be available. We propose using a randomly chosen,\n\"stupid\" integer coordination signal. \"Smart\" agents learn which action they\nshould use for each value of the coordination signal.

We show that the agents learn to play for each coordination signal value\na randomly chosen pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, the\noutcome is an efficient correlated equilibrium. This CE becomes more fair as\nthe number of the available coordination signal values increases."

    "summary": "Learning by observation can be of key importance whenever agents sharing\nsimilar features want to learn from each other. This paper presents an agent\narchitecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the\nactions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task. This is\npossible because the proposed architecture displays information that is\nessential for observation, making it possible for software agents to observe\neach other. The agent architecture supports a learning process that covers all\naspects of learning by observation, such as discovering and observing experts,\nlearning from the observed data, applying the acquired knowledge and evaluating\nthe agents progress. The evaluation provides control over the decision to\nobtain new knowledge or apply the acquired knowledge to new problems. We\ncombine two methods for learning from the observed information. The first one,\nthe recall method, uses the sequence on which the actions were observed to\nsolve new problems. The second one, the classification method, categorizes the\ninformation in the observed data and determines to which set of categories the\nnew problems belong. Results show that agents are able to learn in conditions\nwhere common supervised learning algorithms fail, such as when agents do not\nknow the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the\nactions are visible. The results also show that our approach provides better\nresults than other learning methods since it requires shorter learning periods."

For inference, we assume that a network of agents\nmonitors certain nodes in the social digraph and no agent may be able to\nperform inference within its neighborhood; the agents must rely on inter-agent\ncommunication. The key contributions of this paper include: (i) a novel\nconstruction of the distributed estimator and distributed observability from\nthe first principles; (ii) a graph-theoretic agent classification that\nestablishes the importance and role of each agent towards inference; (iii)\ncharacterizing the necessary conditions, based on the classification in (ii),\non the agent network to achieve distributed observability. Our results are\nbased on structured systems theory and are applicable to any parameter choice\nof the underlying system matrix as long as the social digraph remains fixed. In\nother words, any social phenomena that evolves (linearly) over a\nstructure-invariant social digraph may be considered--we refer to such systems\nas Liner Structure-Invariant (LSI). The aforementioned contributions,\n(i)--(iii), thus, only require the knowledge of the social digraph (topology)\nand are independent of the social phenomena.

By decentralized and\nautonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic\ninformation received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central\ndata processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried\nout by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system\nexploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share\nthis positional information with other flock members locally. Collective\nbehavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration\nfrom statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is\noptimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and\nerror-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented\nseveral fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved\nself-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance\ncapabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation\nflights (grid, rotating ring, straight line).

Here, we integrate information from travel\nsmart card data, a mathematical model of route choice, and a full-scale\nagent-based model of the Singapore RTS to provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the congestion dynamics than can be obtained through\nanalytical modelling alone. Our model is empirically validated, and allows for\nclose inspection of the dynamics including station crowdedness, average travel\nduration, and frequency of missed trains---all highly pertinent factors in\nservice quality. Using current data, the crowdedness in all 121 stations\nappears to be distributed log-normally. In our preliminary scenarios, we\ninvestigate the effect of population growth on service quality. We find that\nthe current population (2 million) lies below a critical point; and increasing\nit beyond a factor of $\\sim10\\%$ leads to an exponential deterioration in\nservice quality. We also predict that incentivizing commuters to avoid the most\ncongested hours can bring modest improvements to the service quality provided\nthe population remains under the critical point. Finally, our model can be used\nto generate simulated data for analytical modelling when such data are not\nempirically available, as is often the case."

    "summary": "Manipulation is a problem of fundamental importance in the context of voting\nin which the voters exercise their votes strategically instead of voting\nhonestly to prevent selection of an alternative that is less preferred. The\nGibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that there is no strategy-proof voting rule\nthat simultaneously satisfies certain combinations of desirable properties.\nResearchers have attempted to get around the impossibility results in several\nways such as domain restriction and computational hardness of manipulation.\nHowever these approaches have been shown to have limitations. Since prevention\nof manipulation seems to be elusive, an interesting research direction\ntherefore is detection of manipulation. Motivated by this, we initiate the\nstudy of detection of possible manipulators in an election.\n  We formulate two pertinent computational problems - Coalitional Possible\nManipulators (CPM) and Coalitional Possible Manipulators given Winner (CPMW),\nwhere a suspect group of voters is provided as input to compute whether they\ncan be a potential coalition of possible manipulators. In the absence of any\nsuspect group, we formulate two more computational problems namely Coalitional\nPossible Manipulators Search (CPMS), and Coalitional Possible Manipulators\nSearch given Winner (CPMSW). We provide polynomial time algorithms for these\nproblems, for several popular voting rules. For a few other voting rules, we\nshow that these problems are in NP-complete. We observe that detecting\nmanipulation maybe easy even when manipulation is hard, as seen for example, in\nthe case of the Borda voting rule."

However, in the actual election, the members of\nsome \"instable\" parties often leave their own party to join other parties. We\nintroduce two parameters to measure the credibility of the prediction based on\nparty preferences: Min is the minimum number of voters leaving the instable\nparties such that the prediction is no longer true, while Max is the maximum\nnumber of voters leaving the instable parties such that the prediction remains\nvalid. Concerning the complexity of computing Min and Max, we consider both\npositional scoring rules (Plurality, Veto, r-Approval and Borda) and\nCondorcet-consistent rules (Copeland and Maximin). We show that for all\nconsidered scoring rules, Min is polynomial-time computable, while it is\nNP-hard to compute Min for Copeland and Maximin.

    "summary": "Research on multi-agent planning has been popular in recent years. While\nprevious research has been motivated by the understanding that, through\ncooperation, multi-agent systems can achieve tasks that are unachievable by\nsingle-agent systems, there are no formal characterizations of situations where\ncooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of\nmulti-agent systems. In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from\nthe planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required\ncooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that\nrequire cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems\nwith heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the\nconditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none\nof these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.\nFurthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum\nnumber of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study\nnot only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many\napplications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve\na task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be\ninformed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a\nsolution."

We prepared two types of tokens,\ncorresponding to the left and right arm of the maze. After training the network\nof the agent to successfully choose the corresponding arm, we presented two\ntokens simultaneously to the agent and observed its behavior. As a result, we\nfound several behaviors, which are difficult to speculate on from a case in\nwhich only a single token is presented to the agent. Detailed analyses and the\nimplications of the model are discussed."

    "summary": "The increasingly sophisticated sensors supported by modern smartphones open\nup novel research opportunities, such as mobile phone sensing. One of the most\nchallenging of these research areas is context-aware and activity recognition.\nThe SmartRescue project takes advantage of smartphone sensing, processing and\ncommunication capabilities to monitor hazards and track people in a disaster.\nThe goal is to help crisis managers and members of the public in early hazard\ndetection, prediction, and in devising risk-minimizing evacuation plans when\ndisaster strikes. In this paper we suggest a novel smartphone-based\ncommunication framework. It uses specific machine learning techniques that\nintelligently process sensor readings into useful information for the crisis\nresponders. Core to the framework is a content-based publish-subscribe\nmechanism that allows flexible sharing of sensor data and computation results.\nWe also evaluate a preliminary implementation of the platform, involving a\nsmartphone app that reads and shares mobile phone sensor data for activity\nrecognition."

This has several disadvantages such as: (1) incoherence of artificial\nsystems exploitation where humans' roles are not clear and (2) vain research of\na user's universal model. In this paper, we adopted a cooperative approach\nwhere the system's components are regarded as being of the same level and they\ncooperate for the service of the global system. We concretized such approach by\nconsidering humans, robots and software systems as autonomous agents assuming\nroles in an organization.

    "summary": "Social intelligence in natural and artificial systems is usually measured by\nthe evaluation of associated traits or tasks that are deemed to represent some\nfacets of social behaviour. The amalgamation of these traits is then used to\nconfigure the intuitive notion of social intelligence. Instead, in this paper\nwe start from a parametrised definition of social intelligence as the expected\nperformance in a set of environments with several agents, and we assess and\nderive tests from it. This definition makes several dependencies explicit: (1)\nthe definition depends on the choice (and weight) of environments and agents,\n(2) the definition may include both competitive and cooperative behaviours\ndepending on how agents and rewards are arranged into teams, (3) the definition\nmostly depends on the abilities of other agents, and (4) the actual difference\nbetween social intelligence and general intelligence (or other abilities)\ndepends on these choices. As a result, we address the problem of converting\nthis definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties\nensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and\nanticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some\nother more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry,\nvalidity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the\ndefinition into a practical test. From the definition and the formalised\nproperties, we take a look at several representative multi-agent environments,\ntests and games to see whether they meet these properties."

    "summary": "Planning for ad hoc teamwork is challenging because it involves agents\ncollaborating without any prior coordination or communication. The focus is on\nprincipled methods for a single agent to cooperate with others. This motivates\ninvestigating the ad hoc teamwork problem in the context of individual decision\nmaking frameworks. However, individual decision making in multiagent settings\nfaces the task of having to reason about other agents' actions, which in turn\ninvolves reasoning about others. An established approximation that\noperationalizes this approach is to bound the infinite nesting from below by\nintroducing level 0 models. We show that a consequence of the finitely-nested\nmodeling is that we may not obtain optimal team solutions in cooperative\nsettings. We address this limitation by including models at level 0 whose\nsolutions involve learning. We demonstrate that the learning integrated into\nplanning in the context of interactive dynamic influence diagrams facilitates\noptimal team behavior, and is applicable to ad hoc teamwork."

    "summary": "There is great potential to be explored regarding the use of agent-based\nmodelling and simulation as an alternative paradigm to investigate early-stage\ncancer interactions with the immune system. It does not suffer from some\nlimitations of ordinary differential equation models, such as the lack of\nstochasticity, representation of individual behaviours rather than aggregates\nand individual memory. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution\nof agent-based modelling and simulation when contrasted with stochastic\nversions of ODE models using early-stage cancer examples. We seek answers to\nthe following questions: (1) Does this new stochastic formulation produce\nsimilar results to the agent-based version? (2) Can these methods be used\ninterchangeably? (3) Do agent-based models outcomes reveal any benefit when\ncompared to the Gillespie results? To answer these research questions we\ninvestigate three well-established mathematical models describing interactions\nbetween tumour cells and immune elements. These case studies were\nre-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and also converted to the\nGillespie algorithm formulation. Our interest in this work, therefore, is to\nestablish a methodological discussion regarding the usability of different\nsimulation approaches, rather than provide further biological insights into the\ninvestigated case studies. Our results show that it is possible to obtain\nequivalent models that implement the same mechanisms; however, the incapacity\nof the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects\nthe similarity of some results. Furthermore, the emergent behaviour of ABMS\nproduces extra patters of behaviour in the system, which was not obtained by\nthe Gillespie algorithm."

In this paper, we\nshow the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for\nNash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in\nimperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original\n(perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes\nthe only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions where any\nresults had been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each\nof which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error\nbound.\n  We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties,\nthe problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of\nthe game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is\nthe distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall\nabstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide\nin the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all\ninformation sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space.\nConversely, if this condition is not satisfied, we show that the input does not\nform a metric space.

To do this, the nodes must use the network connections of\nthe non-participating nodes, which act as bridges for information and ignore\nthe initial values of the non-participating nodes. The solution to this problem\nis made by merging the ideas from estimation theory and consensus theory.

    "summary": "One of the most challenging tasks in software specifications engineering for\na multi-agent system is to ensure correctness. As these systems have high\nconcurrency, often have dynamic environments, the formal specification and\nverification of these systems along with step-wise refinement from abstract to\nconcrete concepts play major role in system correctness. Our objectives are the\nformal specification, analysis with respect to functional as well as\nnon-functional properties by step-wise refinement from abstract to concrete\nspecifications and then formal verification of these specifications. A\nmulti-agent system is concurrent system with processes working in parallel with\nsynchronization between them. We have worked on Gaia multi-agent method along\nwith finite state process based finite automata techniques and as a result we\nhave defined the formal specifications of our system, checked the correctness\nand verified all possible flow of concurrent executions of these\nspecifications. Our contribution consists in transforming requirement\nspecifications based on organizational abstractions into executable formal\nverification specifications based on finite automata. We have considered a case\nstudy of our multi-agent system to exemplify formal specifications and\nverification."

The quantized edge agreement problem of\nsecond-order nonlinear multi-agent system is studied, in which both uniform and\nlogarithmic quantizers are considered. We do not only guarantee the stability\nof the proposed quantized control law, but also reveal the explicit\nmathematical connection of the quantized interval and the convergence\nproperties for both uniform and logarithmic quantizers, which has not been\naddressed before. Particularly, for uniform quantizers, we provide the upper\nbound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood and indicate that the radius\nincreases with the quantization interval. While for logarithmic quantizers, the\nagents converge exponentially to the desired agreement equilibrium. In\naddition, we figure out the relationship of the quantization interval and the\nconvergence speed and also provide the estimates of the convergence rate.\nFinally, simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis."

    "summary": "Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and\nsocieties. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale\ndifference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed\nmicro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This\npaper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local\nspread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease\nbetween regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the\nspread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the\nspread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global\nspread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the\nlocal spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a\nsimulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available\ndata on population, population density, and traffic networks between different\nregions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global\ntraffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results\nshow that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly\nimprove the results of modeling disease spread."

    "summary": "Farming and herding were introduced to Europe from the Near East and\nAnatolia; there are, however, considerable arguments about the mechanisms of\nthis transition. Were it people who moved and outplaced the indigenous hunter-\ngatherer groups or admixed with them? Or was it just material and information\nthat moved-the Neolithic Package-consisting of domesticated plants and animals\nand the knowledge of its use? The latter process is commonly referred to as\ncultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and\npartly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists,\npaleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet\nbeen reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global\nLand Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model\nfor regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian\ngeoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is\nable to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous\nspace-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in\ncontrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also\ndescribes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the\nmodel analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information\nexchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well\nhave arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and\nCentral Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both\ndemic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the\nwestern European transition equally well, (3) [...]"

    "summary": "This paper extends the framework of partially observable Markov decision\nprocesses (POMDPs) to multi-agent settings by incorporating the notion of agent\nmodels into the state space. Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of\nthe environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates\nto maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the\nagents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable\nor observable by other agents. We show that important properties of POMDPs,\nsuch as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise\nlinearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework. Our\napproach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which\nuses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm. We seek to avoid some of the\ndrawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture\noff-equilibrium behaviors. We do so at the cost of having to represent, process\nand continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agents beliefs may be\narbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only\nasymptotically computable. However, approximate belief updates and\napproximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a\nsimple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value\nfunctions."

This has become all the more\nimportant given that we have overburdened and overstressed air traffic\ncontrollers managing hundreds of airports and thousands of aircrafts per day.\n  We propose a multiagent system based distributed approach to handle air\ntraffic ensuring complete human (passenger) safety without removing any humans\n(ground controllers) from the loop thereby also retaining the earlier\nadvantages in the new solution. The detailed design of the agent system, which\nwill be easily interfacable with the existing environment, is described.

Each player is a node in a social network and strives to form a good\nmatch with a neighboring player. We consider the existence, computation, and\ninefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players wants to\ndeviate. When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show\nthat incorporating the well-being of other players into their matching\ndecisions significantly decreases the price of stability, while the price of\nanarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching achieving the\nprice of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time.\nWe extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched\nto each other may receive different utilities from the match. For this more\ngeneral case, we show that incorporating social context (i.e., \"caring about\nyour friends\") can make an even larger difference, and greatly reduce the price\nof anarchy. We show a variety of existence results, and present upper and lower\nbounds on the prices of anarchy and stability for various matching utility\nstructures.

Through modern technologies these\ncoalitions may form across company, organization and system borders. Therefor\nquestions of access control and security are of vital significance for the\narchitectures supporting these coalitions.\n  In this paper, we present our first steps to reach a formal framework for\nmodeling and verifying the design of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalition\ninfrastructures and their processes. In order to do so we extend existing\ndynamic coalition modeling approaches with an access-control-concept, which\nmanages access to information through policies. Furthermore we regard the\nprocesses underlying these coalitions and present first works in formalizing\nthese processes. As a result of the present paper we illustrate the usefulness\nof the Abstract State Machine (ASM) method for this task. We demonstrate a\nformal treatment of privacy-sensitive dynamic coalitions by two example ASMs\nwhich model certain access control situations. A logical consideration of these\nASMs can lead to a better understanding and a verification of the ASMs\naccording to the aspired specification."

For\nthis we introduce inter-agent channels modeled as 2-state automata, compute the\noverall system behavior, and present an effective computational test for\ndelay-robustness. From the test it typically results that the given delay-free\ndistributed control is delay-robust with respect to certain communicated\nevents, but not for all, thus distinguishing events which are not\ndelay-critical from those that are. The approach is illustrated by a workcell\nmodel with three communicating agents."

The performance of the algorithm is analyzed with respect to the\nconvergence to a stable solution.\n  Our results are as follows. For any network, the proposed algorithm is shown\nto converge to an approximate stable solution in polynomial time, namely the\nleaders quickly form teams in which the total number of additional followers\nrequired to satisfy all team size constraints is an arbitrarily small fraction\nof the entire population. In contrast, for general graphs there can be an\nexponential time gap between convergence to an approximate solution and to a\nstable solution."

    "summary": "User cooperation although improves performance of wireless systems, it\nrequires incentives for the potential cooperating nodes to spend their energy\nacting as relays. Moreover, these potential relays are better informed than the\nsource about their transmission costs, which depend on the exact channel\nconditions on their relay-destination links. This results in asymmetry of\navailable information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we use\ncontract theory to tackle the problem of relay selection under asymmetric\ninformation in OFDM-based cooperative wireless system that employs\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We first design incentive compatible\noffers/contracts, consisting of a menu of payments and desired\nsignal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)s at the destination and then the source broadcasts\nthis menu to nearby mobile nodes. The nearby mobile nodes who are willing to\nrelay notify back the source with the contracts they are willing to accept in\neach subcarrier. We show that when the source is under a budget constraint, the\nproblem of relay selection in each subcarrier in order to maximize the capacity\nis a nonlinear non-separable knapsack problem. We propose a heuristic relay\nselection scheme to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our\noverall mechanism and the heuristic solution with a simple relay selection\nscheme and selected numerical results showed that our solution performs better\nand is close to optimal. The overall mechanism introduced in this paper is\nsimple to implement, requires limited interaction with potential relays and\nhence requires minimal signalling overhead."

In this paper we put\nforward a technique to establish a cutoff result, thereby showing that all\nsystems of arbitrary number of agents can be verified by model checking a\nsingle system containing a number of agents equal to the cutoff of the system.\nWhile this problem is undecidable in general, we here define a class of\nparameterised interpreted systems and a parameterised temporal-epistemic logic\nfor which the result can be shown. We exemplify the theoretical results on a\nrobotic example and present an implementation of the technique on top of mcmas,\nan open-source model checker for multi-agent systems."

    "summary": "A key challenge in non-cooperative multi-agent systems is that of developing\nefficient planning algorithms for intelligent agents to interact and perform\neffectively among boundedly rational, self-interested agents (e.g., humans).\nThe practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is being\nundermined due to either the restrictive assumptions of the other agents'\nbehavior, the failure in accounting for their rationality, or the prohibitively\nexpensive cost of modeling and predicting their intentions. To boost the\npracticality of research in this field, we investigate how intention prediction\ncan be efficiently exploited and made practical in planning, thereby leading to\nefficient intention-aware planning frameworks capable of predicting the\nintentions of other agents and acting optimally with respect to their predicted\nintentions. We show that the performance losses incurred by the resulting\nplanning policies are linearly bounded by the error of intention prediction.\nEmpirical evaluations through a series of stochastic games demonstrate that our\npolicies can achieve better and more robust performance than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms."

    "summary": "We abstractly formulate an analytic problem that arises naturally in the\nstudy of coordination in multi-agent systems. Let I be a set of arbitrary\ncardinality (the set of actions) and assume that for each pair of distinct\nactions (i,j), we are given a number \\delta(i,j). We say that a function t,\nspecifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\\delta} if\nfor every pair of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \\delta(i,j) (and\nthus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\\delta(j,i)). While the approach that first comes to\nmind for analysing these definitions is an analytic/geometric one, it turns out\nthat graph-theoretic tools yield powerful results when applied to these\ndefinitions. Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely\nconstraints, and reduce the problem of satisfiability of a timely constraint to\nthe all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite I, furthermore to the\nnegative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that every\nsatisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key\nmilestone on the way to optimally solving a large class of coordination\nproblems - and reduce the problem of finding this minimal satisfying function,\nas well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints, to the\nall-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the\nconstructive definition of a \"nicely-behaved\" representative for each class of\ntimely constraints sharing the same set of satisfying functions. We show that\nthis canonical representative, as well as the map from such canonical\nrepresentatives to the the sets of functions satisfying the classes of timely\nconstraints they represent, has many desired properties, which provide deep\ninsights into the structure underlying the above definitions."

The goal is to make distributed decisions over time to maximize time\naverage utility subject to time average constraints on the penalties. An\nexample is a collection of power constrained sensor nodes that repeatedly\nreport their own observations to a fusion center. Maximum time average utility\nis fundamentally reduced because users do not know the events observed by\nothers. Optimality is characterized for this distributed context.

    "summary": "In two-player zero-sum games, if both players minimize their average external\nregret, then the average of the strategy profiles converges to a Nash\nequilibrium. For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of\ntheoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games\nby proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally\ndefine \\emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids\niteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that\nremoving iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a\nsmall poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the\nworst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield\nstrategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a\nnew modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more\nefficient and may be used to generate stronger strategies than previously\npossible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent\nthat was built using CFR and a novel game decomposition method. Our new agent\nwins the three-player events of the 2012 ACPC and defeats the winning\nthree-player programs from previous competitions while requiring less resources\nto generate than the 2011 winner. Finally, we show that our CFR modification\ncomputes a strategy of equal quality to our new agent in a quarter of the time\nof standard CFR using half the memory."

The centralized system also\nidentifies the traffic intensity thereby prioritizing the roads that need quick\naction to be taken upon. Moreover, the system helps the driver to detect the\nlevel of damage to the road stretch and route the vehicle from an alternative\npath to its destination. The system sends a feedback to the concerned\nauthorities for a quick response to the condition of the roads. The system we\nuse comprises a laser sensor and pressure sensors in shock absorbers to detect\nand quantify the intensity of the pothole, a centralized server which maintains\na database of locations of all the potholes which can be accessed by another\nunit inside the vehicle. A point to point connection device is also installed\nin vehicles so that, when a vehicle detects a pothole which is not in the\ndatabase, all the vehicles within a range of 20 meters are warned about the\npothole. The system computes a route with least number of potholes which is\nnearest to the desired destination . If the destination is unknown, then the\nsystem will check for potholes in the current road and displays the level of\ndamage. The system is flexible enough that the destination can be added,\nremoved or changed any time during the travel. The best possible route is\nsuggested by the system upon the alteration. We prove that the algorithm\nreturns an efficient path with least number of potholes."

    "summary": "Accurate location information is essential for many wireless sensor network\n(WSN) applications. A location-aware WSN generally includes two types of nodes:\nsensors whose locations to be determined and anchors whose locations are known\na priori. For range-based localization, sensors' locations are deduced from\nanchor-to-sensor and sensor-to-sensor range measurements. Localization accuracy\ndepends on the network parameters such as network connectivity and size. This\npaper provides a generalized theory that quantitatively characterizes such\nrelation between network parameters and localization accuracy. We use the\naverage degree as a connectivity metric and use geometric dilution of precision\n(DOP), equivalent to the Cramer-Rao bound, to quantify localization accuracy.\nWe prove a novel lower bound on expectation of average geometric DOP\n(LB-E-AGDOP) and derives a closed-form formula that relates LB-E-AGDOP to only\nthree parameters: average anchor degree, average sensor degree, and number of\nsensor nodes. The formula shows that localization accuracy is approximately\ninversely proportional to the average degree, and a higher ratio of average\nanchor degree to average sensor degree yields better localization accuracy.\nFurthermore, the paper demonstrates a strong connection between LB-E-AGDOP and\nthe best achievable accuracy. Finally, we validate the theory via numerical\nsimulations with three different random graph models."

    "summary": "Human culture is uniquely cumulative and open-ended. Using a computational\nmodel of cultural evolution in which neural network based agents evolve ideas\nfor actions through invention and imitation, we tested the hypothesis that this\nis due to the capacity for recursive recall. We compared runs in which agents\nwere limited to single-step actions to runs in which they used recursive recall\nto chain simple actions into complex ones. Chaining resulted in higher cultural\ndiversity, open-ended generation of novelty, and no ceiling on the mean fitness\nof actions. Both chaining and no-chaining runs exhibited convergence on optimal\nactions, but without chaining this set was static while with chaining it was\never-changing. Chaining increased the ability to capitalize on the capacity for\nlearning. These findings show that the recursive recall hypothesis provides a\ncomputationally plausible explanation of why humans alone have evolved the\ncultural means to transform this planet."

    "summary": "In a society, a proportion of the individuals can benefit from creativity\nwithout being creative themselves by copying the creators. This paper uses an\nagent-based model of cultural evolution to investigate how society is affected\nby different levels of individual creativity. We performed a time series\nanalysis of the mean fitness of ideas across the artificial society varying\nboth the percentage of creators, C, and how creative they are, p using two\ndiscounting methods. Both analyses revealed a valley in the adaptive landscape,\nindicating a tradeoff between C and p. The results suggest that excess\ncreativity at the individual level can be detrimental at the level of the\nsociety because creators invest in unproven ideas at the expense of propagating\nproven ideas."

We extend the\nexisting literature on agent-based models of political economy in the following\nmanner: (1) by introducing a new class of agents- oligarchs - that represent\nleaders of firms in a common industry who lobby for beneficial subsidies\nthrough campaign donations; and (2) by investigating the effects of ideological\npreferences of the oligarchs on legislative action. We test hypotheses from the\nliterature in political economics on the behavior of oligarchs and political\nparties as they interact, under conditions of imperfect information and bounded\nrationality. Our key results indicate that (1) oligarchs tend to donate less to\npolitical campaigns when the parties are more resistant to changing their\npolicies, or when voters are more informed; and (2) if Oligarchs donate to\nparties based on a combination of ideological and profit motivations, Oligarchs\nwill tend to donate at a lower equilibrium level, due to the influence of lost\nprofits.

    "summary": "Crowd simulation is rapidly becoming a standard tool for evacuation planning\nand evaluation. However, the many crowd models in the literature are\nstructurally different, and few have been rigorously calibrated against\nreal-world egress data, especially in emergency situations. In this paper we\ndescribe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or\nbetween models and real-world data. We simulated three models: (1) the lattice\ngas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the\ndistributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation\ntime, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and\n(6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise\nmatrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three\nmodels onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we\nfind the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation\ntime, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models\nare similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find\nthat the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from\neach other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the\nkey test between different models, and also between models and the real world.\nFinally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency\nevacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force\nmodel agrees best with this real data."

    "summary": "Several multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been\nproposed to optimize agents decisions. Due to the complexity of the problem,\nthe majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either\nhad some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or\nobserved other agents actions and the rewards they received.\n  We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL),\nwhich allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark\n2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an\nagent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents\nactions or rewards). Furthermore, WPL does not assume that agents know the\nunderlying game or the corresponding Nash Equilibrium a priori. We\nexperimentally show that our algorithm converges in benchmark\ntwo-player-two-action games. We also show that our algorithm converges in the\nchallenging Shapleys game where previous MARL algorithms failed to converge\nwithout knowing the underlying game or the NE. Furthermore, we show that WPL\noutperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100\nagents interacting and learning concurrently.\n  An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is\nanalyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning\nagents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis\nnot only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually\nconverge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to\nconvergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show\nthat symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the\nnon-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had\neither linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs\ndynamics differential equations and compare the solution to the dynamics of\nprevious MARL algorithms."

    "summary": "Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the\ncreation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to\nefficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective\ncoalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.\nCentral to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many\npossible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually\nrequires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the\ncoalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it\nwas formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a\ncombination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one\ncoalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.\nHowever, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging\ndue to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows\nexponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many\nalgorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques\nranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search\nall of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution\nquality, and memory requirements.\n  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition\nstructure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel\nrepresentation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible\nsolutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower\nbounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are\nthen used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the\noptimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches\nthrough the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound\ntechnique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).\nIn this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition\nstructures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions\nautomatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop\na new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable\nbenchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.\nGiven this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able\nto find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the\nfastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if\ninterrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a\nsolution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.\nMoreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are\nsignificantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art\nalgorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case\ndistribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient\nsolution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution."

    "summary": "Because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take, it\nshould plan which resources it holds over time carefully, considering its\ninherent limitations (such as power or payload restrictions), the competing\nneeds of other agents for the same resources, and the stochastic nature of the\nenvironment. Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if\nthey can use --- and even create --- opportunities to change which resources\nthey hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could\nbreak their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally\nreconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned\nresources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.\nIn this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential\noptimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We\npresent a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of\nthis problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined)\naccounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our\nformulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at\neach phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each\nphase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them\nto find solutions significantly faster(orders of magnitude faster in larger\nproblems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically."

In such games, each player has a weight, and a\ncoalition of players wins the game if its total weight meets or exceeds a given\nquota. A players power in such games is usually not directly proportional to\nhis weight, and is measured by a power index, the most prominent among which\nare the Shapley-Shubik index and the Banzhaf index.In this paper, we\ninvestigate by how much a player can change his power, as measured by the\nShapley-Shubik index or the Banzhaf index, by means of a false-name\nmanipulation, i.e., splitting his weight among two or more identities. For both\nindices, we provide upper and lower bounds on the effect of weight-splitting.\nWe then show that checking whether a beneficial split exists is NP-hard, and\ndiscuss efficient algorithms for restricted cases of this problem, as well as\nrandomized algorithms for the general case. We also provide an experimental\nevaluation of these algorithms. Finally, we examine related forms of\nmanipulative behavior, such as annexation, where a player subsumes other\nplayers, or merging, where several players unite into one.

However, in some cases it is impractical for an agent to give a linear\norder over all the alternatives. It has been suggested to let agents submit\npartial orders instead. Then, given a voting rule, a profile of partial orders,\nand an alternative (candidate) c, two important questions arise: first, is it\nstill possible for c to win, and second, is c guaranteed to win? These are the\npossible winner and necessary winner problems, respectively. Each of these two\nproblems is further divided into two sub-problems: determining whether c is a\nunique winner (that is, c is the only winner), or determining whether c is a\nco-winner (that is, c is in the set of winners). We consider the setting where\nthe number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes are unweighted.

    "summary": "The problem of adversarial multi-robot patrol has gained interest in recent\nyears, mainly due to its immediate relevance to various security applications.\nIn this problem, robots are required to repeatedly visit a target area in a way\nthat maximizes their chances of detecting an adversary trying to penetrate\nthrough the patrol path. When facing a strong adversary that knows the patrol\nstrategy of the robots, if the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm,\nthen in many cases it is easy for the adversary to penetrate undetected (in\nfact, in some of those cases the adversary can guarantee penetration).\nTherefore this paper presents a non-deterministic patrol framework for the\nrobots. Assuming that the strong adversary will take advantage of its knowledge\nand try to penetrate through the patrols weakest spot, hence an optimal\nalgorithm is one that maximizes the chances of detection in that point. We\ntherefore present a polynomial-time algorithm for determining an optimal patrol\nunder the Markovian strategy assumption for the robots, such that the\nprobability of detecting the adversary in the patrols weakest spot is\nmaximized. We build upon this framework and describe an optimal patrol strategy\nfor several robotic models based on their movement abilities (directed or\nundirected) and sensing abilities (perfect or imperfect), and in different\nenvironment models - either patrol around a perimeter (closed polygon) or an\nopen fence (open polyline)."

    "summary": "Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human activity can\nbe learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort to date has\nconcentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groups\nof people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on modeling actual successful\nexecutions (and not failed or attempted executions) of the activities of\ninterest. We, in contrast, take on the task of understanding human\ninteractions, attempted interactions, and intentions from noisy sensor data in\na fully relational multi-agent setting. We use a real-world game of capture the\nflag to illustrate our approach in a well-defined domain that involves many\ndistinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain\nusing Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that\njointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such\nas a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposed\nby the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the\nrules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound\nfashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a\nmulti-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the\nactivity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future\nbehaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded\nit. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent\nactivities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same\nactivities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable\nof recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions with\nhigh accuracy. We compare our approach with other alternatives and show that\nour unified model, which takes into account not only relationships among\nindividual players, but also relationships among activities over the entire\nlength of a game, although more computationally costly, is significantly more\naccurate. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful\nattempts boosts performance on other important recognition tasks."

We formalize what\nit means for a cloning manipulation to be successful (which turns out to be a\nsurprisingly delicate issue), and, for a number of common voting rules,\ncharacterize the preference profiles for which a successful cloning\nmanipulation exists. We also consider the model where there is a cost\nassociated with producing each clone, and study the complexity of finding a\nminimum-cost cloning manipulation. Finally, we compare cloning with two related\nproblems: the problem of control by adding candidates and the problem of\npossible (co)winners when new alternatives can join."

    "summary": "Traffic congestion in urban road networks is a costly problem that affects\nall major cities in developed countries. To tackle this problem, it is possible\n(i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a\nnetwork, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at\nspecific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of\nthe existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart\ntransportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising\nfield of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular,\nmultiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and\nimplementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous\nagents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby\ngenerating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system\nand maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms\nfor the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.\n  In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the\nmanagement of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous\nvehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact\nwith the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the\nroad network. Building on the reservation-based intersection control model\nproposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a\nsingle intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we\nanalyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for\nthe allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a\ntraffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers\nroute choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that\nintegrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive\ntraffic assignment strategy."

    "summary": "Agent technology is a software paradigm that permits to implement large and\ncomplex distributed applications. In order to assist the development of\nmulti-agent systems, agent-oriented methodologies (AOM) have been created in\nthe last years to support modeling more and more complex applications in many\ndifferent domains. By defining in a non-ambiguous way concepts used in a\nspecific domain, Meta modeling may represent a step towards such\ninteroperability. In the Transport domain, this paper propose an agent-oriented\nmeta-model that provides rigorous concepts for conducting transportation system\nproblem modeling. The aim is to allow analysts to produce a transportation\nsystem model that precisely captures the knowledge of an organization so that\nan agent-oriented requirements specification of the system-to-be and its\noperational corporate environment can be derived from it. To this end, we\nextend and adapt an existing meta-model, Extended Gaia, to build a meta-model\nand an adequate model for transportation problems. Our new agent-oriented\nmeta-model aims to allow the analyst to model and specify any transportation\nsystem as a multi-agent system. Based on the proposed meta-model, we proposes\nan approach for modeling and evaluating the Transportation System based on\nStochastic Activity Network (SAN) components. The proposed process is based on\nseven steps from Recognition phase to Quantitative Analysis phase. These\nanalyzes are based on the Dependability models which are built using the\nformalism Stochastic Activity Network. A real case study of Urban Public\nTransportation System has been conducted to show the benefits of the approach."

The\nstate of the art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures\nand ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an\ninfrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming\ntechnologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint\nsolver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the\nagent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic\nprogramming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of\nperformance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced\ntechnology (e.g., search strategies and complex constraints) for solving DCOPs."

Furthermore, the agents are\nsubject to communication constraints. The presented solution follows the\nautomata-theoretic approach to LTL model checking, however, it avoids the\ncomputationally demanding construction of synchronized product system between\nthe agents. We suggest a decentralized coordination among the agents through a\ndynamic leader-follower scheme, to guarantee the low-level connectivity\nmaintenance at all times and a progress towards the satisfaction of the\nleader's task. By a systematic leader switching, we ensure that each agent's\ntask will be accomplished."

    "summary": "When autonomous agents are executing in the real world, the state of the\nworld as well as the objectives of the agent may change from the agent's\noriginal model. In such cases, the agent's planning process must modify the\nplan under execution to make it amenable to the new conditions, and to resume\nexecution. This brings up the replanning problem, and the various techniques\nthat have been proposed to solve it. In all, three main techniques -- based on\nthree different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work.\nAn open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this\nrequires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In\nthis paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by\ncompiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this\nnovel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not\ninterchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other. Thus we\nfocus attention on the incompatibility of the various replanning flavors with\neach other, founded in the differences between the metrics that they\nrespectively seek to optimize."

Such network-centric environments are\ncommon in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most\nresearch (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among\ndistributed agents as a given.

In this paper, we investigate if\nand how novelty search, an evolutionary technique driven by behavioural\nnovelty, can overcome convergence in coevolution. We propose three methods for\napplying novelty search to coevolutionary systems with two species: (i) score\nboth populations according to behavioural novelty; (ii) score one population\naccording to novelty, and the other according to fitness; and (iii) score both\npopulations with a combination of novelty and fitness.

    "summary": "We consider approval-based committee voting, i.e. the setting where each\nvoter approves a subset of candidates, and these votes are then used to select\na fixed-size set of winners (committee). We propose a natural axiom for this\nsetting, which we call justified representation (JR). This axiom requires that\nif a large enough group of voters exhibits agreement by supporting the same\ncandidate, then at least one voter in this group has an approved candidate in\nthe winning committee. We show that for every list of ballots it is possible to\nselect a committee that provides JR. However, it turns out that several\nprominent approval-based voting rules may fail to output such a committee. In\nparticular, while Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) always outputs a committee\nthat provides JR, Reweighted Approval Voting (RAV), a tractable approximation\nto PAV, does not have this property. We then introduce a stronger version of\nthe JR axiom, which we call extended justified representation (EJR), and show\nthat PAV satisfies EJR, while other rules we consider do not; indeed, EJR can\nbe used to characterize PAV within the class of weighted PAV rules. We also\nconsider several other questions related to JR and EJR, including the\nrelationship between JR/EJR and core stability, and the complexity of the\nassociated algorithmic problems."

    "summary": "This paper details the implementation of a software framework that aids the\ndevelopment of distributed and self-configurable software systems. This\nframework is an instance of a novel integration strategy called SoSAA (SOcially\nSituated Agent Architecture), which combines Component-Based Software\nEngineering and Agent-Oriented Software Engineering, drawing its inspiration\nfrom hybrid agent control architectures. The framework defines a complete\nconstruction process by enhancing a simple component-based framework with\nreasoning and self-awareness capabilities through a standardized interface.\n  The capabilities of the resulting framework are demonstrated through its\napplication to a non-trivial Multi Agent System (MAS). The system in question\nis a pre-existing Information Retrieval (IR) system that has not previously\ntaken advantage of CBSE principles. In this paper we contrast these two systems\nso as to highlight the benefits of using this new hybrid approach. We also\noutline how component-based elements may be integrated into the Agent Factory\nagent-oriented application framework."

The algorithm solves a sequence of (separable) strongly convex\nproblems and mantains feasibility at each iteration. Convergence to a\nstationary solution of the original nonconvex optimization is established. Our\nframework is very general and flexible; it unifies several existing Successive\nConvex Approximation (SCA)-based algorithms such as (proximal) gradient or\nNewton type methods, block coordinate (parallel) descent schemes, difference of\nconvex functions methods, and improves on their convergence properties. More\nimportantly, and differently from current SCA approaches, it naturally leads to\ndistributed and parallelizable implementations for a large class of nonconvex\nproblems.\n  This Part I is devoted to the description of the framework in its generality.\nIn Part II we customize our general methods to several multi-agent optimization\nproblems, mainly in communications and networking; the result is a new class of\n(distributed) algorithms that compare favorably to existing ad-hoc\n(centralized) schemes (when they exist)."

    "summary": "Consider the problem of minimizing the expected value of a (possibly\nnonconvex) cost function parameterized by a random (vector) variable, when the\nexpectation cannot be computed accurately (e.g., because the statistics of the\nrandom variables are unknown and/or the computational complexity is\nprohibitive). Classical sample stochastic gradient methods for solving this\nproblem may empirically suffer from slow convergence. In this paper, we propose\nfor the first time a stochastic parallel Successive Convex Approximation-based\n(best-response) algorithmic framework for general nonconvex stochastic\nsum-utility optimization problems, which arise naturally in the design of\nmulti-agent systems. The proposed novel decomposition enables all users to\nupdate their optimization variables in parallel by solving a sequence of\nstrongly convex subproblems, one for each user. Almost surely convergence to\nstationary points is proved. We then customize our algorithmic framework to\nsolve the stochastic sum rate maximization problem over\nSingle-Input-Single-Output (SISO) frequency-selective interference channels,\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels, and MIMO\nmultiple-access channels. Numerical results show that our algorithms are much\nfaster than state-of-the-art stochastic gradient schemes while achieving the\nsame (or better) sum-rates."

    "summary": "One important challenge for a set of agents to achieve more efficient\ncollaboration is for these agents to maintain proper models of each other. An\nimportant aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial\nand incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models:\nMDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many\napplications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt.\nWhile it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for\nlearning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability\nmodels, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning\ncapability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning,\nand the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan\nexecution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of\nincompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP\nbased and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\\em\nabstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability\nmodels are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g.,\nrobot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore,\nwhen used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately),\ncapability models provide flexible abstraction of actions. The limitation,\nhowever, is that the synthesized plan is incomplete and abstract."

    "summary": "In many situations a player may act so as to maximize a perceived utility\nthat does not coincide with the objective of the system analyst or designer.\nSuch discrepancies may arise due to rational factors (such as tolls or\nrestricted budgets), or due to cognitive biases such as those that are common\nin behavioral economics: risk attitudes, altruism, present-bias and so on. When\nanalyzing a game, one may ask how inefficiency, as measured by the Price of\nAnarchy (PoA), is affected by the perceived utilities. This question is\nespecially challenging in the presence of heterogeneous biases, where each\nplayer essentially plays a different game. The smoothness method [Roughgarden\n'04,'09] naturally extends to games with homogeneous perceived utilities or\ncosts, regardless of the game or the behavioral bias. We show that such\nbiased-smoothness is broadly applicable in the context of nonatomic congestion\ngames: In games with arbitrary heterogeneous biases, we bound the agents'\nequilibrium costs purely based on their own biased-smoothness parameters, as\nwell as on structural parameters of the underlying network. For symmetric\nheterogeneous games, we provide a {\\em biased PoA} bound that depends on the\naverage biased-smoothness of all participating types. We complement our\npositive results with examples showing tightness or almost-tightness of the\nupper bounds. We also identify various classes of cost functions and biases\nthat are biased-smooth, thereby substantially improving some recent results\nfrom the literature."

The direct solution of this problem by\nsolving a single-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality\n(VI) is numerically intractable due to the exponential scaling of computation\ncomplexity with problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the single-obstacle HJI VI\ncannot directly handle situations in which vehicles do not have a common\nscheduled arrival time. Instead, we perform sequential path planning by\nconsidering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as\ntime-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a\ndouble-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined\nas the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying\nwithin a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the\ndouble-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the\noptimal control for each vehicle.

Since it is often\ninfeasible to elicit the preferences of all the voters in a typical prediction\nscenario, a common algorithm used for winner prediction is to run the election\non a small sample of randomly chosen votes and output the winner as the\nprediction. We analyze the performance of this algorithm for many common voting\nrules.\n  More formally, we introduce the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-winner determination\nproblem, where given an election on $n$ voters and $m$ candidates in which the\nmargin of victory is at least $\\epsilon n$ votes, the goal is to determine the\nwinner with probability at least $1-\\delta$. The margin of victory of an\nelection is the smallest number of votes that need to be modified in order to\nchange the election winner. We show interesting lower and upper bounds on the\nnumber of samples needed to solve the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-winner determination\nproblem for many common voting rules, including scoring rules, approval,\nmaximin, Copeland, Bucklin, plurality with runoff, and single transferable\nvote. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds match for many common voting rules\nin a wide range of practically appealing scenarios."

    "summary": "By an undirected rigid formation of mobile autonomous agents is meant a\nformation based on graph rigidity in which each pair of \"neighboring\" agents is\nresponsible for maintaining a prescribed target distance between them. In a\nrecent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control\nlaws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected\nformations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by\nkinematic point models. The aim of this paper is to explain what happens to\nsuch formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of\nwhat the desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if\nneighboring agents have differing estimates of what the actual distance between\nthem is. In either case, what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of\nthe formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed\ndistances increase. While this is observed for the gradient laws in question,\nsomething else quite unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for\nany rigidity-based, undirected formation of this type which is comprised of\nthree or more agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different\nunderstandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to be,\nthen almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid\nformation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in\ntwo-dimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular\nspeed."

Here we investigate the performance of a group of\nagents in locating the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes with varying\ndegrees of ruggedness. Cooperation is taken into account through imitative\nlearning and the broadcasting of messages informing on the fitness of each\nagent. We find a trade-off between the group size and the frequency of\nimitation: for rugged landscapes, too much imitation or too large a group yield\na performance poorer than that of independent agents. By decreasing the\ndiversity of the group, imitative learning may lead to duplication of work and\nhence to a decrease of its effective size. However, when the parameters are set\nto optimal values the cooperative group substantially outperforms the\nindependent agents."

Money transfer is forbidden. Distinct\nfrom the standard literature, which assumes the amount of resources brought by\nan individual to be public information, we consider this amount as an agent's\nprivate, possibly multi-dimensional type. Our goal is to design truthful\nmechanisms that achieve two objectives: max-min and Pareto efficiency. For each\nobjective, we provide a reduction that converts any optimal algorithm into a\nstrategy-proof mechanism that achieves the same objective. Our reductions do\nnot inspect the input algorithms but only query these algorithms as oracles.\nApplying the reductions, we produce strategy-proof mechanisms in a non-trivial\napplication: network route allocation. Our models and result in the application\nare valuable on their own rights."

    "summary": "Interacting systems are increasingly common. Many examples pervade our\neveryday lives: automobiles, aircraft, defense systems, telephone switching\nsystems, financial systems, national governments, and so on. Closer to computer\nscience, embedded systems and Systems of Systems are further examples of\ninteracting systems. Common to all of these is that some \"whole\" is made up of\nconstituent parts, and these parts interact with each other. By design, these\ninteractions are intentional, but it is the unintended interactions that are\nproblematic. The Systems of Systems literature uses the terms \"constituent\nsystems\" and \"constituents\" to refer to systems that interact with each other.\nThat practice is followed here. This paper presents a visual formalism, Swim\nLane Event-Driven Petri Nets, that is proposed as a basis for Model-Based\nTesting (MBT) of interacting systems. In the absence of available tools, this\nmodel can only support the offline form of Model-Based Testing."

We show that the\nparameters can be chosen so that the platoon behaves as a wave equation with\ndifferent wave velocities.

    "summary": "Bribery in elections is an important problem in computational social choice\ntheory. However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent\ncomputational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to\ncapture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber\nis frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a\ncertain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the\ngoal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only\nvulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes\nhave prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by\nchanging only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber.\nWe further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem\nnamely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery\nwhere the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or\ndifferent.\n  We study the computational complexity of the above problems for unweighted\nand weighted elections for several commonly used voting rules. We observe that,\neven if we have only a small number of candidates, the problems are intractable\nfor all voting rules studied here for weighted elections, with the sole\nexception of the Frugal-bribery problem for the plurality voting rule. In\ncontrast, we have polynomial time algorithms for the Frugal-bribery problem for\nplurality, veto, k-approval, k-veto, and plurality with runoff voting rules for\nunweighted elections. However, the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem is\nintractable for all the voting rules studied here barring the plurality and the\nveto voting rules for unweighted elections."

The CM problem, however, has been studied\nonly in the complete information setting, that is, when the manipulators know\nthe votes of the non-manipulators. A more realistic scenario is an incomplete\ninformation setting where the manipulators do not know the exact votes of the\nnon- manipulators but may have some partial knowledge of the votes. In this\npaper, we study a setting where the manipulators know a partial order for each\nvoter that is consistent with the vote of that voter. In this setting, we\nintroduce and study two natural computational problems - (1) Weak Manipulation\n(WM) problem where the manipulators wish to vote in a way that makes their\npreferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of the\nnon-manipulators; (2) Strong Manipulation (SM) problem where the manipulators\nwish to vote in a way that makes their preferred candidate win in all possible\nextensions of the partial votes of the non-manipulators. We study the\ncomputational complexity of the WM and the SM problems for commonly used voting\nrules such as plurality, veto, k-approval, k-veto, maximin, Copeland, and\nBucklin.

    "summary": "It has been argued that the speed-density digram of pedestrian movement has\nan inflection point. This inflection point was found empirically in\ninvestigations of closed-loop single-file pedestrian movement. The reduced\ncomplexity of single-file movement does not only allow a higher precision for\nthe evaluation of empirical data, but it occasionally also allows analytical\nconsiderations for micosimulation models. In this way it will be shown that\ncertain (common) variants of the Social Force Model (SFM) do not produce an\ninflection point in the speed-density diagram if infinitely many pedestrians\ncontribute to the force computed for one pedestrian. We propose a modified\nSocial Force Model that produces the inflection point."

    "summary": "Crowdsourcing of jobs to online freelance markets is rapidly gaining\npopularity. Most crowdsourcing platforms are uncontrolled and offer freedom to\ncustomers and freelancers to choose each other. This works well for unskilled\njobs (e.g., image classification) with no specific quality requirement since\nfreelancers are functionally identical. For skilled jobs (e.g., software\ndevelopment) with specific quality requirements, however, this does not ensure\nthat the maximum number of job requests is satisfied. In this work we determine\nthe capacity of freelance markets, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests,\nand propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized\noperation and freedom of choice for customers and freelancers, we propose\nsimple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowdsourcing platforms\nthat approximately achieve capacity. Further, for settings where the number of\njob requests exceeds capacity, we propose a scheme that is agnostic of that\ninformation, but is optimal and fair in declining jobs without wait."

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multi-agent systems,\nespecially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as\nexponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes\nit difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a\nnovel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)\nis presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL\nalgorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for\nagents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile\n(non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented\nNegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for\nsparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum\nvariance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of\nlocal Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared\nvalue functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to\nachieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational\ncomplexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI\nalgorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:\nsteps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime\n(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games\nand shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.\nThen in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent\nwarehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms."

Cooperation among\nclusters is beneficial when the optimal models of adjacent clusters have a good\nnumber of similar entries. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for solving\nthis problem. The approach relies on minimizing a global mean-square error\ncriterion regularized by non-differentiable terms to promote cooperation among\nneighboring clusters. A general diffusion forward-backward splitting strategy\nis introduced. Then, it is specialized to the case of sparsity promoting\nregularizers. A closed-form expression for the proximal operator of a weighted\nsum of $\\ell_1$-norms is derived to achieve higher efficiency.

As a result, engineering modern SCADA is a challenging issue and\nconventional engineering approaches are no longer suitable for them because of\ntheir increasing complexity and highly distribution. In this research,\nMulti-Agent Systems (MAS) are used to enable building adaptive agent-based\nSCADA system by modeling system components as agents in the micro level and as\norganizations or societies of agents in the macro level.

    "summary": "This study simulates the evolution of artificial economies in order to\nunderstand the tax relevance of administrative boundaries in the quality of\nlife of its citizens. The modeling involves the construction of a computational\nalgorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and\ngovernments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real\nestate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher\nquality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods\nmarket allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by\nprice and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms\n(location) and candidates (qualification). The government may be configured\ninto one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments. The role of\ngovernment is to collect taxes on the value added of firms in its territory and\ninvest the taxes into higher levels of quality of life for residents. The model\ndoes not have a credit market. The results suggest that the configuration of\nadministrative boundaries is relevant to the levels of quality of life arising\nfrom the reversal of taxes. The model with seven regions is more dynamic, with\nhigher GDP values, but more unequal and heterogeneous across regions. The\nsimulation with only one region is more homogeneously poor. The study seeks to\ncontribute to a theoretical and methodological framework as well as to\ndescribe, operationalize and test computer models of public finance analysis,\nwith explicitly spatial and dynamic emphasis. Several alternatives of expansion\nof the model for future research are described. Moreover, this study adds to\nthe existing literature in the realm of simple microeconomic computational\nmodels, specifying structural relationships between local governments and\nfirms, consumers and dwellings mediated by distance."

    "summary": "We consider the following variant of the two dimensional gathering problem\nfor swarms of robots: Given a swarm of $n$ indistinguishable, point shaped\nrobots on a two dimensional grid. Initially, the robots form a closed chain on\nthe grid and must keep this connectivity during the whole process of their\ngathering. Connectivity means, that neighboring robots of the chain need to be\npositioned at the same or neighboring points of the grid. In our model,\ngathering means to keep shortening the chain until the robots are located\ninside a $2\\times 2$ subgrid. Our model is completely local (no global control,\nno global coordinates, no compass, no global communication or vision, \\ldots).\nEach robot can only see its next constant number of left and right neighbors on\nthe chain. This fixed constant is called the \\emph{viewing path length}. All\nits operations and detections are restricted to this constant number of robots.\nOther robots, even if located at neighboring or the same grid point cannot be\ndetected. Only based on the relative positions of its detectable chain\nneighbors, a robot can decide to obtain a certain state. Based on this state\nand their local knowledge, the robots do local modifications to the chain by\nmoving to neighboring grid points without breaking the chain. These\nmodifications are performed without the knowledge whether they lead to a global\nprogress or not. We assume the fully synchronous $\\mathcal{FSYNC}$ model. For\nthis problem, we present a gathering algorithm which needs linear time. This\nresult generalizes the result from \\cite{hopper}, where an open chain with\nspecified distinguishable (and fixed) endpoints is considered."

The problem is\nalso hard in practice, as evidenced by several recent attempts to tackle it. On\nthe other hand, model checking of alternating epistemic mu-calculus can have a\ndistinctly lower computational complexity.\n  In this work, we look at the idea of approximating the former problem by the\nverification of its \"naive\" translations to the latter.

We consider a central controller and a number of\nresources, where each resource is either a load, a generator, or a combination\nthereof, like a battery. The controller periodically computes power setpoints\nfor the resources based on the estimated state of the grid and an overall\nobjective, and subject to safety constraints. Each resource is augmented with a\nresource agent that a) implements the setpoint requests sent by the controller\non the resource, and b) translates device-specific information about the\nresource into a device-independent representation and transmits this to the\ncontroller.\n  We focus on the resource agents and their impact on the overall system's\nbehavior. Intuitively, for the system to converge to the objective, the\nresource agents should be obedient to the requests from the controller, in the\nsense that the actually implemented setpoint should be close to the requested\nsetpoint, at least on average. This can be important especially when a\ncontroller that performs continuous optimization is used (for the sake of\nperformance) to control discrete resources (which have a discrete set of\nimplementable setpoints).\n  We formalize obedience by defining the notion of $c$-bounded\naccumulated-error. We then demonstrate its usefulness, by presenting\ntheoretical results (for a simple scenario) and simulation results (for a more\nrealistic setting) that indicate that, if all resource agents in the system\nhave bounded accumulated-error, the closed-loop system converges on average to\nthe objective. Finally, we show how to design resource agents that provably\nhave bounded accumulated-error for various types of resources, such as\nresources with uncertainty (e.g., PV panels) and resources with a discrete set\nof implementable setpoints (e.g., on-off heating systems)."

We present an\napproach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems,\nexploiting a property that can be thought of as \"anonymous influence\" in the\nfactored MDP. Anonymous influence summarizes joint variable effects efficiently\nwhenever the explicit representation of variable identity in the problem can be\navoided. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into\ncomputational efficiencies, both for general variable elimination in a factor\ngraph but in particular also for the approximate linear programming solution to\nfactored MDPs. The latter allows to scale linear programming to factored MDPs\nthat were previously unsolvable. Our results are shown for the control of a\nstochastic disease process over a densely connected graph with 50 nodes and 25\nagents."

In these catchment areas, 90% of agents are\nwithin $5.4$ km of their designated exit node. We establish a characteristic\nflow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node and\nexit node width) and a mean flow rate in free-flow regime by simulating total\nevacuations using an agent based `queuing network' model. We use these\nvariables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and\nresultant ETE.

In this case, we obtain several\ncounterintuitive results. First of all, a player might help improve the payoff\nof its team, even if it is dominated by the entire other team.

Given an arbitrarily distributed (yet connected)\nswarm of robots, the gathering problem on the grid is to locate all robots\nwithin a $2\\times 2$-sized area that is not known beforehand. Two robots are\nconnected if they are vertical or horizontal neighbors on the grid. The\nlocality constraint means that no global control, no compass, no global\ncommunication and only local vision is available; hence, a robot can only see\nits grid neighbors up to a constant $L_1$-distance, which also limits its\nmovements. A robot can move to one of its eight neighboring grid cells and if\ntwo or more robots move to the same location they are \\emph{merged} to be only\none robot. The locality constraint is the significant challenging issue here,\nsince robot movements must not harm the (only globally checkable) swarm\nconnectivity. For solving the gathering problem, we provide a synchronous\nalgorithm -- executed by every robot -- which ensures that robots merge without\nbreaking the swarm connectivity. In our model, robots can obtain a special\nstate, which marks such a robot to be performing specific connectivity\npreserving movements in order to allow later merge operations of the swarm.\nCompared to the grid, for gathering in the Euclidean plane for the same robot\nand time model the best known upper bound is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$."

The cost of providing the\nincentives is not borne by the MAS and does not come from fines charged for\nnorm violations (fines may be impossible to levy in a system where agents are\nfree to leave and rejoin again under a different identity). Instead, monitoring\nincentives come from (scrip) fees for accessing the services provided by the\nMAS.

This work investigates the causes of group formation when these\nexternal factors are not present and individuals compete for the same\nresources, i.e. within-group competition.\n  A motivating example for our research is a recent anthropological study that\nfound evidence for an increase in social tolerance among Homo Sapiens starting\nfrom the Middle Pleistocene. Social tolerance is a prerequisite for the\ncreation of large social groups that include unrelated individuals, but at the\nsame time it becomes evolutionarily successful only if interactions with\nunrelated individuals are frequent.\n  We argue that lack of information about resource location could have induced\nfrequent interactions between unrelated individuals, as it would enable\ncollective sensing and provide an evolutionary advantage. Collective sensing\nrefers to the ability of a group to sense what is beyond the capabilities of\nthe individual. Collective sensing is present in nature but its role in group\nformation has never been studied.\n  We test our hypothesis by means of an agent-based evolutionary model of a\nforaging task, with which we compare the fitness individuals using different\nnavigation strategies: random walk and herding behavior, i.e. moving towards\ncrowded areas. Although agents are unable to perceive resources at the\nindividual level, interactions between them allow the group of herding agents\nto collectively locate resources.\n  Our findings suggest that evolution favors the spontaneous formation of\ngroups, if resources become scarce and information about their location is not\navailable at the individual level but can be inferred from the dynamics of the\npopulation."

For the air highway placement problem, the fast marching method is\nused to produce a sequence of air highways that minimizes the cost of flying\nfrom an origin to any destination. The placement of air highways can be updated\nin real-time to accommodate sudden airspace changes. Within platoons traveling\non air highways, each vehicle is modeled as a hybrid system.

The Stochastic Collection and Replenishment (SCAR) scenario is\nmotivated by mining and agricultural scenarios where a dedicated replenishment\nagent transports a resource between a centralised replenishment point to agents\nusing the resource in the field. The agents in the field typically operate\nwithin fixed areas (for example, benches in mining applications, and fields or\norchards in agricultural scenarios), and the motion of the replenishment agent\nmay be restricted by a road network. Existing research has typically approached\nthe problem of scheduling the actions of the dedicated replenishment agent from\na short-term and deterministic angle. This paper introduces a method of\nincorporating uncertainty in the schedule optimisation through a novel\nprediction framework, and a branch and bound optimisation method which uses the\nprediction framework to minimise the downtime of the agents. The prediction\nframework makes use of several Gaussian approximations to quickly calculate the\nrisk-weighted cost of a schedule.

Of the two objective functions, one uses a\nMonte Carlo method, while the other uses a significantly faster analytical\nmethod. Approximations to multiplication, division and inversion of Gaussian\ndistributed variables are used to facilitate propagation of probability\ndistributions in the analytical method when Gaussian distributed parameters are\nused.

Furthermore, our method is scalable\nbeyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics than\nan extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collision\navoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations."

    "summary": "Multi-UAV systems are safety-critical, and guarantees must be made to ensure\nno undesirable configurations such as collisions occur. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)\nreachability is ideal for analyzing such safety-critical systems because it\nprovides safety guarantees and is flexible in terms of system dynamics,\nhowever, its direct application is limited to small-scale systems typically of\nno more than two vehicles because of the exponentially-scaling computation\ncomplexity. Previously, the sequential path planning (SPP) method, which\nassigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, SPP allows multi-vehicle\npath planning to be done with a linearly-scaling computation complexity.\nHowever, the previous SPP formulation assumed that there are no disturbances in\nthe vehicle dynamics, and that every vehicle has perfect knowledge of the\nposition of higher-priority vehicles. In this paper, we make SPP more practical\nby providing three different methods to account for disturbances in dynamics\nand imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' states. Each method has\ndifferent assumptions about information sharing. We demonstrate our proposed\nmethods in simulations."

    "summary": "This article analyzes two classes of job selection policies that control how\na network of autonomous aerial vehicles delivers goods from depots to\ncustomers. Customer requests (jobs) occur according to a spatio-temporal\nstochastic process not known by the system. If job selection uses a policy in\nwhich the first job (FJ) is served first, the system may collapse to\ninstability by removing just one vehicle. Policies that serve the nearest job\n(NJ) first show such threshold behavior only in some settings and can be\nimplemented in a distributed manner. The timing of job selection has\nsignificant impact on delivery time and stability for NJ while it has no impact\nfor FJ. Based on these findings we introduce a methodological approach for\ndecision- making support to set up and operate such a system, taking into\naccount the trade-off between monetary cost and service quality. In particular,\nwe compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve\na certain expected delivery time. The approach includes three time horizons:\nlong-term decisions on the number of depots to deploy in the service area, mid-\nterm decisions on the number of vehicles to use, and short-term decisions on\nthe policy to operate the vehicles."

These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of\nglobally common strategies. Prior work shows that the problem of determining\nthe existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for these games is NP-complete already\nfor graphs with all weights equal to one and no bonuses. However, for several\nclasses of graphs (e.g. DAGs and cliques) pure Nash equilibria or even strong\nequilibria always exist and can be found by simply following a particular\nimprovement or coalition-improvement path, respectively. In this paper we\nidentify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or\ncoalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a\nconsequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in\npolynomial time. We also argue that these results are optimal in the sense that\nin natural generalisations of these classes of graphs, a pure Nash equilibrium\nmay not even exist."

Yet bottom-up approaches that could\ninclude behavior of users have not been well studied so far. We propose an\nagent-based model for the short time evolution of a bike-sharing system, with a\nfocus on two strategical parameters that are the role of the quantity of\ninformation users have on the all system and the propensity of user to walk\nafter having dropped their bike. We implement the model in a general way so it\nis applicable to every system as soon as data are available in a certain\nformat. The model of simulation is parametrized and calibrated on processed\nreal time-series of bike movements for the system of Paris. After showing the\nrobustness of the simulations by validating internally and externally the\nmodel, we are able to test different user-based strategies for an increase of\nthe level of service. In particular, we show that an increase of user\ninformation can have significant impact on the homogeneity of repartition of\nbikes in docking stations, and, what is important for a future implementation\nof the strategy, that an action on only 30% of regular users is enough to\nobtain most of the possible amelioration."

Besides to\nthe specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of\nagents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity\nof such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with\nemergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were\ndefined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was\ncarried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and\necological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development\nof a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger\nset of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in\nquestioning essential issues associated with the DS field.

In particular, we show\nthat (a) under the traditional lexicographic tie-breaking, the game converges\nfor any order of players under a weak restriction on voters' actions; and (b)\nPlurality with randomized tie-breaking is not guaranteed to converge under\narbitrary agent schedulers, but from any initial state there is \\emph{some}\npath of better-replies to a Nash equilibrium.

The\nagents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The\nagents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less\nunits with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is\nprogrammed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on\nthe relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control,\nwhich is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local\ngathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as\nthe visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters\nand a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each\ntime-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and\nall the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of\npairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of\nthe influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete.\nThese results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the\nvisibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient\nconditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show\nthat if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control\nsignal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the\ngraph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology,\ncould not be found."

    "summary": "A framework for consensus modelling is introduced using Kleene's three valued\nlogic as a means to express vagueness in agents' beliefs. Explicitly borderline\ncases are inherent to propositions involving vague concepts where sentences of\na propositional language may be absolutely true, absolutely false or\nborderline. By exploiting these intermediate truth values, we can allow agents\nto adopt a more vague interpretation of underlying concepts in order to weaken\ntheir beliefs and reduce the levels of inconsistency, so as to achieve\nconsensus. We consider a consensus combination operation which results in\nagents adopting the borderline truth value as a shared viewpoint if they are in\ndirect conflict. Simulation experiments are presented which show that applying\nthis operator to agents chosen at random (subject to a consistency threshold)\nfrom a population, with initially diverse opinions, results in convergence to a\nsmaller set of more precise shared beliefs. Furthermore, if the choice of\nagents for combination is dependent on the payoff of their beliefs, this acting\nas a proxy for performance or usefulness, then the system converges to beliefs\nwhich, on average, have higher payoff."

    "summary": "Advances in healthcare and in the quality of life significantly increase\nhuman life expectancy. With the ageing of populations, new un-faced challenges\nare brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be\nwell-functioning until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive.\nHowever, as the lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration\nemerge. There are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment;\ntherefore, the complex ageing phenomena needs further understanding.\nImmunosenescence, the ageing of the immune system, is highly correlated to the\nnegative effects of ageing, such as the increase of auto-inflammatory diseases\nand decrease in responsiveness to new diseases. Besides clinical and\nmathematical tools, we believe there is opportunity to further exploit\nsimulation tools to understand immunosenescence. Compared to real-world\nexperimentation, benefits include time and cost effectiveness due to the\nlaborious, resource-intensiveness of the biological environment and the\npossibility of conducting experiments without ethic restrictions. Contrasted\nwith mathematical models, simulation modelling is more suitable for\nrepresenting complex systems and emergence. In addition, there is the belief\nthat simulation models are easier to communicate in interdisciplinary contexts.\nOur work investigates the usefulness of simulations to understand\nimmunosenescence by employing two different simulation methods, agent-based and\nsystem dynamics simulation, to a case study of immune cells depletion with age."

At the time of assigning resources, each\nagent privately holds information about her distribution on future values for\ndifferent assignments. Subsequently, we allow for payments to be contingent on\nex post utilization decisions. The objective is to maximize expected\nutilization, while insisting on dominant-strategy equilibria, individual\nrationality, and no-deficit. We also consider two additional, natural\nproperties: an agent should not pay if she utilizes a resource, and resources\nshould always be assigned if possible. We show that the natural, contingent\nsecond-price (CSP) mechanism, is unique under these criteria and optimal for a\nlarger class of mechanisms for assigning a single resource. We extend the CSP\nmechanism to assign multiple, heterogeneous resources (making a technical\nconnection with assignment problems under non quasi-linear utility functions),\nshowing that this generalized mechanism outperforms other methods such as\nfirst-come-first-serve and the VCG mechanism."

In order to implement the proposed scheme,\nthe base stations are not required to exchange channel state information (CSI),\nbut will require to exchange interference values once. We show ADMM's tracking\nability in terms of the algorithm's Lyapunov function given that the primal and\ndual solutions to the convex optimization problem at hand can be understood as\na continuous mapping from the problem's parameters. We show that this holds\ntrue even considering that the problem looses strong convexity when it is made\ndistributed.

Convergence happens on a per-player basis, and even in the\npresence of players with cyclic preferences, the players with acyclic\npreferences will stabilize. Thus, we obtain a candidate notion for rationality\nin the presence of irrational agents.

    "summary": "Consider a situation with $n$ agents or players where some of the players\nform a coalition with a certain collective objective. Simple games are used to\nmodel systems that can decide whether coalitions are successful (winning) or\nnot (losing). A simple game can be viewed as a monotone boolean function. The\ndimension of a simple game is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that the\nsimple game can be expressed as the intersection of $d$ threshold functions\nwhere each threshold function uses a threshold and $n$ weights. Taylor and\nZwicker have shown that $d$ is bounded from above by the number of maximal\nlosing coalitions. We present two new upper bounds both containing the\nTaylor/Zwicker-bound as a special case. The Taylor/Zwicker-bound imply an upper\nbound of ${n \\choose n/2}$. We improve this upper bound significantly by\nshowing constructively that $d$ is bounded from above by the cardinality of any\nbinary covering code with length $n$ and covering radius $1$. This result\nsupplements a recent result where Olsen et al. showed how to construct simple\ngames with dimension $|C|$ for any binary constant weight SECDED code $C$ with\nlength $n$. Our result represents a major step in the attempt to close the\ndimensionality gap for simple games."

Recent years have seen an increase of using formal methods in the\nanalysis and design of cooperative adaptive cruise control systems. However,\nmost existing results using formal methods usually assumed an ideal\ninter-vehicle communication, which is far from the real world situation. Hence,\nwe are motivated to close the gap by explicitly considering non-deterministic\ntime delay and packet dropout due to unreliable inter-vehicle communications.\nIn particular, we consider a passive safety property, which requests a vehicle\nto avoid any collisions that can be considered as its fault. Under the\nassumption that the communication delay is bounded and we know the upper bound,\nwe then formally verify the passivity safety of a class of hybrid CACC systems.\nThis result allows us to define a safe control envelope that will guide the\nsynthesis of control signals. Vehicles under the CACC within the safe control\nenvelope are guaranteed to avoid active collisions."

The boundedness of the domain precludes the\nneed to impose assumptions on decaying properties of the scalar field at\ninfinity. Moreover, exponential convergence of the swarm density to the\nequilibrium follows from properties of the spectrum of the semigroup generator.\nIn addition, we use the proposed coverage method to construct a\ntime-inhomogenous diffusion process and apply the observability of the heat\nequation to reconstruct the scalar field over the entire domain from\nobservations of the robots' random motion over a small subset of the domain.

The\nimplementation of a policy without pedestrian analysis might lead to a very\ncostly trial and error due to the implementation cost (i.e. user cost,\nconstruction time and cost, etc.). On the other hand, using good analysis\ntools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once\nthe analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy\nis straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy\nquantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.\nSince the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic\nlevel of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the\nanalytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and\nsimulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the\npolicy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its\nimplementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The\nmodel was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian\ndynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an\nexperimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed. The simulation\nresults showed that the keep right policy or the lane-like segregation policy\nis inclined to be superior to do minimum or mix-lane policy in terms of average\nspeed, average delay and dissipation time."

    "summary": "The calibration and validation of pedestrian simulations require the\nacquisition of empirical evidences of human behaviour. The current work\npresents the results of an experiment focused on the potentially combined\neffect of counter flow and grouping on pedestrian dynamics. In particular, we\nfocused on: (i) four different configurations of flow ratio (the rate between\nthe minor flow and the total flow in bidirectional scenarios); (ii) dyads, as\nthe most frequently observed and basic social groups of crowds. Results showed\nthat the increase of flow ratio negatively impacted the speed of pedestrians.\nDyads walked significantly slower than singletons, due to the difficulty in\nmovement coordination among group members (proxemics) in case of counter flow.\nThe collected results represent an useful contribution towards the validation\nof pedestrian simulations."

    "summary": "The problem of the distributed recovery of jointly sparse signals has\nattracted much attention recently. Let us assume that the nodes of a network\nobserve different sparse signals with common support; starting from linear,\ncompressed measurements, and exploiting network communication, each node aims\nat reconstructing the support and the non-zero values of its observed signal.\nIn the literature, distributed greedy algorithms have been proposed to tackle\nthis problem, among which the most reliable ones require a large amount of\ntransmitted data, which barely adapts to realistic network communication\nconstraints. In this work, we address the problem through a reweighted $\\ell_1$\nsoft thresholding technique, in which the threshold is iteratively tuned based\non the current estimate of the support. The proposed method adapts to\nconstrained networks, as it requires only local communication among neighbors,\nand the transmitted messages are indices from a finite set. We analytically\nprove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we show that it outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art greedy methods in terms of balance between recovery\naccuracy and communication load."

    "summary": "We consider the following problem - a group of mobile agents perform some\ntask on a terrain modeled as a graph. In a given moment of time an adversary\ngets an access to the graph and positions of the agents. Shortly before\nadversary's observation the mobile agents have a chance to relocate themselves\nin order to hide their initial configuration. We assume that the initial\nconfiguration may possibly reveal to the adversary some information about the\ntask they performed. Clearly agents have to change their location in possibly\nshort time using minimal energy. In our paper we introduce a definition of a\n\\emph{well hiding} algorithm in which the starting and final configurations of\nthe agents have small mutual information. Then we discuss the influence of\nvarious features of the model on the running time of the optimal well-hiding\nalgorithm. We show that if the topology of the graph is known to the agents,\nthen the number of steps proportional to the diameter of the graph is\nsufficient and necessary. In the unknown topology scenario we only consider a\nsingle agent case. We first show that the task is impossible in the\ndeterministic case if the agent has no memory. Then we present a polynomial\nrandomized algorithm. Finally in the model with memory we show that the number\nof steps proportional to the number of edges of the graph is sufficient and\nnecessary. In some sense we investigate how complex is the problem of \"losing\"\ninformation about location (both physical and logical) for different settings."

    "summary": "Individual robots are not effective at exploring large unmapped areas. An\nalternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,\nrather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm\n(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.\nRobots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets\nin the area without global localization or central control, and return the\ntargets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large\nnumbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas\nresult in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the\nmultiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed\nthroughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but\nreturn to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging\nbehavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic\nalgorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes\nand the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always\nproduces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search\ntime compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the\nadvantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential\ndisadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic\nalgorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less\ncommunication."

    "summary": "Consensus formation is investigated for multi-agent systems in which agents'\nbeliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth\nstate meaning \\emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of\nuncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits\nborderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a\ncompromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents\napply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence\nrestriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with\neach other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus\noperator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are\ninfluenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the\nformer we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief\nupdating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of\nassuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible\nthey are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus\noperators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which\nis both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus\nformation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is\ncloser to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only\nchanged as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent\ninteractions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true\nstate of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the\npopulation converging to a high quality shared belief."

    "summary": "Coalition formation typically involves the coming together of multiple,\nheterogeneous, agents to achieve both their individual and collective goals. In\nthis paper, we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as\nGraph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the\nagents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem\ngiven that in many real-world applications, agents may be connected by a\ncommunication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We\npropose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge\ncontraction, which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF\nproblem as a rooted tree. Then, we propose an anytime solution algorithm\n(CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of\ncharacteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover, we show how CFSS can\nbe efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of\nthe search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios,\nusing a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large\nnumber of households in the UK. Our results show that, in the best case, the\nserial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the\nart, while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on\na 12-core machine. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime\napproximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents\n(i.e., with more than 2700 agents)."

    "summary": "A major challenge faced in the design of large-scale cyber-physical systems,\nsuch as power systems, the Internet of Things or intelligent transportation\nsystems, is that traditional distributed optimal control methods do not scale\ngracefully, neither in controller synthesis nor in controller implementation,\nto systems composed of millions, billions or even trillions of interacting\nsubsystems. This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by\nleveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller\nsynthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions\nof separability for control objective functions and system constraints such\nthat the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a\ndistributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel\nsubproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity)\nconstraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local\nmodels and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the\nconvexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a\nconsequence, the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to\nthe size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control\nproblems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG, $\\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal\ncontrol with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed\n$\\mathcal{H}_2/\\mathcal{L}_1$ optimal control problems, satisfy these notions\nof separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance,\nactuator and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a\nlarge-scale power inspired system."

While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every\ngame with probability 1, in practice, it is resource-constrained: its maximum\nprediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.\nUnder these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a\nV-formation game.\n  Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical\nmodel checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the\ncontroller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1, the\ncontroller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2,\nthe game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the\ndisplacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker,\ni.e. one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive\ncounterpart that randomly executes its attack."

    "summary": "This paper extends and adapts an existing abstract model into an empirical\nmetropolitan region in Brazil. The model - named SEAL: a Spatial Economic\nAgent-based Lab - comprehends a framework to enable public policy ex-ante\nanalysis. The aim of the model is to use official data and municipalities\nspatial boundaries to allow for policy experimentation. The current version\nconsiders three markets: housing, labor and goods. Families' members age,\nconsume, join the labor market and trade houses. A single consumption tax is\ncollected by municipalities that invest back into quality of life improvements.\nWe test whether a single metropolitan government - which is an aggregation of\nmunicipalities - would be in the best interest of its citizens. Preliminary\nresults for 20 runs indicate that it may be the case. Future developments\ninclude improving performance to enable running of higher percentage of the\npopulation and a number of runs that make the model more robust."

    "summary": "In multi-robot systems where a central decision maker is specifying the\nmovement of each individual robot, a communication failure can severely impair\nthe performance of the system. This paper develops a motion strategy that\nallows robots to safely handle critical communication failures for such\nmulti-robot architectures. For each robot, the proposed algorithm computes a\ntime horizon over which collisions with other robots are guaranteed not to\noccur. These safe time horizons are included in the commands being transmitted\nto the individual robots. In the event of a communication failure, the robots\nexecute the last received velocity commands for the corresponding safe time\nhorizons leading to a provably safe open-loop motion strategy. The resulting\nalgorithm is computationally effective and is agnostic to the task that the\nrobots are performing. The efficacy of the strategy is verified in simulation\nas well as on a team of differential-drive mobile robots."

This topic has been receiving\nconsiderable attention in recent years with emphasis on both single-task and\nmultitask scenarios. In single-task adaptation, agents cooperate to track an\nobjective of common interest, while in multitask adaptation agents track\nmultiple objectives simultaneously. Regularization is one useful technique to\npromote and exploit similarity among tasks in the latter scenario. This work\nexamines an alternative way to model relations among tasks by assuming that\nthey all share a common latent feature representation. As a result, a new\nmultitask learning formulation is presented and algorithms are developed for\nits solution in a distributed online manner. We present a unified framework to\nanalyze the mean-square-error performance of the adaptive strategies, and\nconduct simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings and potential\napplications."

We\nreveal various properties of the equilibrium, such as the lack of influence of\nthe most-likely-to-participate player on the behavior of the other players. We\nperform this analysis with two scenarios: the sum-profit model, where the\nauctioneer obtains the sum of all submitted bids, and the max-profit model of\ncrowdsourcing contests, where the auctioneer can only use the best submissions\nand thus obtains only the winning bid.\n  Furthermore, we examine various methods of influencing the probability of\nparticipation such as the effects of misreporting one's own probability of\nparticipating, and how influencing another player's participation chances\nchanges the player's strategy."

In addition to the\ntraditional \"material\" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced\nin order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in\nengineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff\nvalue depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and\nbeliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium\npayoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes\nequilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic\nempathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering\nincluding resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and\nforwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an\nexperiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The\nbasic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure\nthe empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is\ndeveloped to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants.\nThe experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical\ngame theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and\na significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are\npositively partially empathetic."

In the context of Multi-agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource\nabstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource\nabstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource\nallocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance\nand applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented\nassumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the\nliterature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both\nsettings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource\nand keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can\npromote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a\nreal-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what\nknowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network\nDomain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of\na network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the\nload on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application\nof state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse\ntheir performance. RND allows us to highlight an important limitation of\nresource abstraction and show that the difference rewards approach manages to\nbetter capture and inform the agents about the dynamics of the environment."

    "summary": "Robust environment perception is essential for decision-making on robots\noperating in complex domains. Intelligent task execution requires principled\ntreatment of uncertainty sources in a robot's observation model. This is\nimportant not only for low-level observations (e.g., accelerometer data), but\nalso for high-level observations such as semantic object labels. This paper\nformalizes the concept of macro-observations in Decentralized Partially\nObservable Semi-Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POSMDPs), allowing scalable\nsemantic-level multi-robot decision making. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is\nused to model noise statistics of low-level classifier outputs, while\nsimultaneously allowing sharing of domain noise characteristics between\nclasses. Classification accuracy of the proposed macro-observation scheme,\ncalled Hierarchical Bayesian Noise Inference (HBNI), is shown to exceed\nexisting methods. The macro-observation scheme is then integrated into a\nDec-POSMDP planner, with hardware experiments running onboard a team of dynamic\nquadrotors in a challenging domain where noise-agnostic filtering fails. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a real-time,\nconvolutional neural net-based classification framework running fully onboard a\nteam of quadrotors in a multi-robot decision-making domain."

It also allows different Hamiltonians\nfor each independent distribution, to facilitate Monte Carlo estimation of\nthose distributions. The approach leads to a novel energy-minimization\nalgorithm in which each coordinate Monte Carlo estimates an associated\nspectrum, and then independently sets its state by sampling a Boltzmann\ndistribution across that spectrum. It can also be used for high-dimensional\nnumerical integration, (constrained) combinatorial optimization, and adaptive\ndistributed control. This approach also provides a simple, physics-based\nderivation of the powerful approximate energy-minimization algorithms\nsemi-formally derived in \\cite{wowh00, wotu02c, wolp03a}.

By means of a master equation approach, we analyze the\ninternal agent dynamics of Naming Game in populations embedded on networks,\nfinding that it strongly depends on very general topological properties of the\nsystem (e.g. average and fluctuations of the degree). However, the influence of\ntopological properties on the microscopic individual dynamics is a general\nphenomenon that should characterize all those social interactions that can be\nmodeled by memory-based negotiation processes."

    "summary": "We introduce a model of negotiation dynamics whose aim is that of mimicking\nthe mechanisms leading to opinion and convention formation in a population of\nindividuals. The negotiation process, as opposed to ``herding-like'' or\n``bounded confidence'' driven processes, is based on a microscopic dynamics\nwhere memory and feedback play a central role. Our model displays a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition from an absorbing state in which all agents\nreach a consensus to an active stationary state characterized either by\npolarization or fragmentation in clusters of agents with different opinions. We\nshow the exystence of at least two different universality classes, one for the\ncase with two possible opinions and one for the case with an unlimited number\nof opinions. The phase transition is studied analytically and numerically for\nvarious topologies of the agents' interaction network. In both cases the\nuniversality classes do not seem to depend on the specific interaction\ntopology, the only relevant feature being the total number of different\nopinions ever present in the system."

    "summary": "Adaptivity, both of the individual agents and of the interaction structure\namong the agents, seems indispensable for scaling up multi-agent systems\n(MAS's) in noisy environments. One important consideration in designing\nadaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible\nto machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL)\ntechniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting\nagents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the\nagents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg\ngames. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control\nnetwork packet routing.\n  We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps\nsurprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be\nbetter suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential\nperformance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents\nachieve throughputs up to three and one half times better than that of the\nstandard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol\ntraffic is maintained. We then demonstrate that much of that potential\nimprovement can be realized by having the agents learn their settings when the\nagent interaction structure is itself adaptive."

    "summary": "Preference elicitation is a central problem in AI, and has received\nsignificant attention in single-agent settings. It is also a key problem in\nmultiagent systems, but has received little attention here so far. In this\nsetting, the agents may have different preferences that often must be\naggregated using voting. This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,\ninformation should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have\nrevealed about their preferences so far.\n  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the\nmost common voting protocols. It turns out that in the Single Transferable Vote\nprotocol, even knowing when to terminate elicitation is mathcal NP-complete,\nwhile this is easy for all the other protocols under study. Even for these\nprotocols, determining how to elicit effectively is NP-complete, even with\nperfect suspicions about how the agents will vote. The exception is the\nPlurality protocol where such effective elicitation is easy.\n  We also show that elicitation introduces additional opportunities for\nstrategic manipulation by the voters. We demonstrate how to curtail the space\nof elicitation schemes so that no such additional strategic issues arise."

Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so\nthat the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a\n(socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a\nmechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at\nhand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism\ndesign optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on\nsettings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism\ndesign problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for\ndominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then\nshow that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem\nbecomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational\ncomplexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents' preferences by\nmaking the agents face additional uncertainty. This comes at no loss, and in\nsome cases at a gain, in the (social) objective."

From an augmented Lagrangian which incorporates the\nsynchronization constraints both as soft and hard constraints, a network is\nderived wherein the local minimizers interact and exchange information through\nthe synchronization constraints. From the viewpoint of neural networks, the\narray can be considered as a Lagrange programming network for continuous\noptimization and as a cellular neural network (CNN). The penalty weights\nassociated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the\nsolution to a linear program. This expresses that the energy cost of the\nensemble should maximally decrease. In this way successful local minimizers can\nimplicitly impose their state to the others through a mechanism of master-slave\ndynamics resulting into a cooperative search mechanism.

A coalition of\nagents can sometimes accomplish things that the individual agents cannot, or\ncan do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a\nsolution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in\nthe sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new\ncoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game\ntheory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have\nreceived less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software\nagents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly\nexplicit.\n  In this paper we define a concise general representation for games in\ncharacteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for\nefficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core. We then show that\ndetermining whether the core is nonempty is $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete both with\nand without transferable utility.

We also\npropose methods to integrate this system with insecure channels. This new\nresiliency can be applied to broadcast and peer-to-peer secure communication\nsystems where agents may be traitors or become unreliable due to faults."

    "summary": "The public sector comprises government agencies, ministries, education\ninstitutions, health providers and other types of government, commercial and\nnot-for-profit organisations. Unlike commercial enterprises, this environment\nis highly heterogeneous in all aspects. This forms a complex network which is\nnot always optimised. A lack of optimisation and communication hinders\ninformation sharing between the network nodes limiting the flow of information.\nAnother limiting aspect is privacy of personal information and security of\noperations of some nodes or segments of the network. Attempts to reorganise the\nnetwork or improve communications to make more information available for\nsharing and analysis may be hindered or completely halted by public concerns\nover privacy, political agendas, social and technological barriers. This paper\ndiscusses a technical solution for information sharing while addressing the\nprivacy concerns with no need for reorganisation of the existing public sector\ninfrastructure . The solution is based on imposing an additional layer of\nIntelligent Software Agents and Knowledge Bases for data mining and analysis."

The coupling between the players' mixed strategies,\narising as the system evolves from one instant to the next, is determined by\nthe system designer. Information theory tells us that the most likely joint\nstrategy of the players, given a value of the expectation of the overall\ncontrol objective function, is the minimizer of a Lagrangian function of the\njoint strategy. So the goal of the system designer is to speed evolution of the\njoint strategy to that Lagrangian minimizing point, lower the expectated value\nof the control objective function, and repeat. Here we elaborate the theory of\nalgorithms that do this using local descent procedures, and that thereby\nachieve efficient, adaptive, distributed control."

    "summary": "The development of cost-effective highperformance parallel computing on\nmulti-processor supercomputers makes it attractive to port excessively time\nconsuming simulation software from personal computers (PC) to super computes.\nThe power distribution system simulator (PDSS) takes a bottom-up approach and\nsimulates load at the appliance level, where detailed thermal models for\nappliances are used. This approach works well for a small power distribution\nsystem consisting of a few thousand appliances. When the number of appliances\nincreases, the simulation uses up the PC memory and its runtime increases to a\npoint where the approach is no longer feasible to model a practical large power\ndistribution system. This paper presents an effort made to port a PC-based\npower distribution system simulator to a 128-processor shared-memory\nsupercomputer. The paper offers an overview of the parallel computing\nenvironment and a description of the modification made to the PDSS model. The\nperformance of the PDSS running on a standalone PC and on the supercomputer is\ncompared. Future research direction of utilizing parallel computing in the\npower distribution system simulation is also addressed."

    "summary": "It has been argued that a central objective of nanotechnology is to make\nproducts inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to\nvery low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a\nstep towards this vision. In previous work (JohnnyVon 1.0), we simulated\nmachines that bonded together to form self-replicating strands. There were two\ntypes of machines (called types 0 and 1), which enabled strands to encode\narbitrary bit strings. However, the information encoded in the strands had no\nfunctional role in the simulation. The information was replicated without being\ninterpreted, which was a significant limitation for potential manufacturing\napplications. In the current work (JohnnyVon 2.0), the information in a strand\nis interpreted as instructions for assembling a polygonal mesh. There are now\nfour types of machines and the information encoded in a strand determines how\nit folds. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight\n(although they flex slightly due to virtual forces acting on the machines), or\nin a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By\nchoosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a\nvariety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial\nunfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates\nby bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the\nencoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form\na mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured\nin the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the\nseed."

Stabilization of a system of information\nagents represents a capability of the agents to eventually get correct\ninformation about their surrounding despite unpredictable environment changes\nand the incapability of many agents to sense such changes causing them to have\ntemporary incorrect information. We argue that the stabilization of a system of\ncooperative information agents could be understood as the convergence of the\nbehavior of the whole system toward the behavior of a \"superagent\", who has the\nsensing and computing capabilities of all agents combined. We show that\nunfortunately, stabilization is not guaranteed in general, even if the agents\nare fully cooperative and do not hide any information from each other.

Among the systems we\nstudy--plurality, Condorcet, and approval voting--we find cases where systems\nimmune or computationally resistant to a chair choosing the winner nonetheless\nare vulnerable to the chair blocking a victory. Beyond that, we see that among\nour studied systems no one system offers the best protection against\ndestructive control.

    "summary": "Awerbuch et al.'s approach to distributed recommender systems (DRSs) is to\nhave agents sample products at random while randomly querying one another for\nthe best item they have found; we improve upon this by adding a communication\nnetwork. Agents can only communicate with their immediate neighbors in the\nnetwork, but neighboring agents may or may not represent users with common\ninterests. We define two network structures: in the ``mailing-list model,''\nagents representing similar users form cliques, while in the ``word-of-mouth\nmodel'' the agents are distributed randomly in a scale-free network (SFN). In\nboth models, agents tell their neighbors about satisfactory products as they\nare found. In the word-of-mouth model, knowledge of items propagates only\nthrough interested agents, and the SFN parameters affect the system's\nperformance. We include a summary of our new results on the character and\nparameters of random subgraphs of SFNs, in particular SFNs with power-law\ndegree distributions down to minimum degree 1. These networks are not as\nresilient as Cohen et al. originally suggested. In the case of the widely-cited\n``Internet resilience'' result, high failure rates actually lead to the\norphaning of half of the surviving nodes after 60% of the network has failed\nand the complete disintegration of the network at 90%. We show that given an\nappropriate network, the communication network reduces the number of sampled\nitems, the number of messages sent, and the amount of ``spam.'' We conclude\nthat in many cases DRSs will be useful for sharing information in a multi-agent\nlearning system."

For example, Cohen et al. study scale-free\nnetworks including some which approximate the measured degree distribution of\nthe Internet. Their results suggest that if each node in this network failed\nindependently with probability 0.99, the remaining network would continue to\nhave a giant component. In this paper, we show that a large and important\nsubclass of scale-free networks are not robust to massive numbers of random\nnode deletions for practical purposes. In particular, we study finite\nscale-free networks which have minimum node degree of 1 and a power-law degree\ndistribution beginning with nodes of degree 1 (power-law networks). We show\nthat, in a power-law network approximating the Internet's reported\ndistribution, when the probability of deletion of each node is 0.5 only about\n25% of the surviving nodes in the network remain connected in a giant\ncomponent, and the giant component does not persist beyond a critical failure\nrate of 0.9. The new result is partially due to improved analytical\naccommodation of the large number of degree-0 nodes that result after node\ndeletions. Our results apply to finite power-law networks with a wide range of\npower-law exponents, including Internet-like networks. We give both analytical\nand empirical evidence that such networks are not generally robust to massive\nrandom node deletions."

We obtain both\npolynomial-time bribery algorithms and proofs of the intractability of bribery,\nand indeed our results show that the complexity of bribery is extremely\nsensitive to the setting. For example, we find settings in which bribery is\nNP-complete but manipulation (by voters) is in P, and we find settings in which\nbribing weighted voters is NP-complete but bribing voters with individual bribe\nthresholds is in P. For the broad class of elections (including plurality,\nBorda, k-approval, and veto) known as scoring protocols, we prove a dichotomy\nresult for bribery of weighted voters: We find a simple-to-evaluate condition\nthat classifies every case as either NP-complete or in P."

We derive necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a consensus on\nglobally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results proved in this\nwork is that a consensus is achieved for any bounded delay condition if and\nonly if the directed graph is quasi-strongly connected. We also provide a\nclosed form expression for the global consensus, showing that the effect of\ndelays is, in general, to introduce a bias in the final decision.

In this paper, we study how social news aggregator Digg exploits\nsocial information processing to solve the problems of document recommendation\nand rating. First, we show, by tracking stories over time, that social networks\nplay an important role in document recommendation. The second contribution of\nthis paper consists of two mathematical models.

Another attractive solution concept is a\nNash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare. We show that, while exactly\ncomputing the latter is infeasible (we prove that solving this problem may\ninvolve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree), there exists an FPTAS\nfor finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has\npolynomial size.

Each agent is\ncharacterized by a set of parameters that serve to make iterated predictions of\ntwo successive returns. The future price is determined according to the offer\nand the demand of all agents. The system evolves by redistributing the capital\namong the agents in each trading cycle. Without noise the dynamics of this\nsystem is nearly regular and thereby fails to reproduce the stochastic return\nfluctuations observed in real markets. However, when in each cycle a small\namount of noise is introduced we find the typical features of real financial\ntime series like fat-tails of the return distribution and large temporal\ncorrelations in the volatility without significant correlations in the price\nreturns. Introducing the noise by an evolutionary process leads to different\nscalings of the return distributions that depend on the definition of fitness.\nBecause our realistic model has only very few parameters, and the results\nappear to be robust with respect to the noise level and the number of agents we\nexpect that our framework may serve as new paradigm for modeling self generated\nreturn fluctuations in markets."

    "summary": "Imitation is fundamental in the understanding of social system dynamics. But\nthe diversity of imitation rules employed by modelers proves that the modeling\nof mimetic processes cannot avoid the traditional problem of endogenization of\nall the choices, including the one of the mimetic rules. Starting from the\nremark that human reflexive capacities are the ground for a new class of\nmimetic rules, I propose a formal framework, metamimetic games, that enable to\nendogenize the distribution of imitation rules while being human specific. The\ncorresponding concepts of equilibrium - counterfactually stable state - and\nattractor are introduced. Finally, I give an interpretation of social\ndifferentiation in terms of cultural co-evolution among a set of possible\nmotivations, which departs from the traditional view of optimization indexed to\ncriteria that exist prior to the activity of agents."

As three basic relationships between two species are present in\nNature, namely symbiosis, predator-prey and competition, three different models\nare obtained. Each model is a cubic two-dimensional discrete logistic-type\nequation with its own dynamical properties: stationary regime, periodicity,\nquasi-periodicity and chaos. We also propose that these models could be useful\nfor thinking in the different interactions happening in the economic world, as\nfor instance for the competition and the collaboration between corporations.\nFurthermore, these models could be considered as the basic ingredients to\nconstruct more complex interactions in the ecological and economic networks."

Answering this question helps to understand why new language\nconstructs usually propagate along an S-shaped curve with a rather sudden\ntransition towards global agreement. It also helps to analyze and design new\ntechnologies that support or orchestrate self-organizing communication systems,\nsuch as recent social tagging systems for the web. The article introduces and\nstudies a microscopic model of communicating autonomous agents performing\nlanguage games without any central control. We show that the system undergoes a\ndisorder/order transition, going trough a sharp symmetry breaking process to\nreach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition, the system builds up\nnon-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distribution of\ncompeting synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make the\nsystem ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on\nthe time-scale of collective behaviors, becomes sharper and sharper with system\nsize. This surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up\nto very large populations but also suggests ways to optimize artificial\nsemiotic dynamics."

This can be interpreted as a\ncoexistence of different social norms, a result that goes beyond previous\ninvestigations. The model is discrete in time and space, behavior is\ncharacterized in a continuous state space. The adaptation of social behavior by\neach agent is based on attractive and repulsive forces caused by friendly and\nadversary relations among agents. The model is analyzed both analytically and\nby means of spatio-temporal computer simulations.

What strikes\nfrom these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and\nbacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge\ncoherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in\nmind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the\ncollective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA\nalgorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal\ncomplex functions described in the well-know De Jong test suite. Later, for the\npurpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA\nalgorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed.\nFinal results indicate that the SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and\nquickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative\nforaging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and\ncontradictory purposes, while outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed.

    "summary": "The paper studies the problem of distributed average consensus in sensor\nnetworks with quantized data and random link failures. To achieve consensus,\ndither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When\nthe quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),\nstochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with\nprobability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that\nthe meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link\nweight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study\ndithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is\nbounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded\nquantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the\nsupremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is\naccomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:\none along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to\nthe consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale\nand supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use\nthese probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore\ntradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization\nsteps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy\n$\\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer\ndesign with a numerical study."

Depending on the parameter\nsetting, the system can display Pareto or Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior in the\nasymptotic dynamical regime. The regions of parameter space where the system\nexhibits one of these two statistical behaviors are delimited.

    "summary": "Many complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\nconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\nsuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\nagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\nthey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\ncan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\nvalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\nframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\nestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\nmathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\nsuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\nand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\nsampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\ndynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\nof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\nuniversal model for computation."

    "summary": "Computational modelling with multi-agent systems is becoming an important\ntechnique of studying language evolution. We present a brief introduction into\nthis rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an\nanalysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating\nagents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an\nevolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and\nlinguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of\nthe model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically\nunskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with\nlarge learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds\nvia Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language\nand that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the\nincrease of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity\nincreases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several\ntransition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets\nan additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting\nthe evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and\nbiological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect\ncertainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species."

Agents have to evaluate the risk of being infected, and decide if\nand when communicating partners are affordable.

Moreover, this\ninformation is slowly forgotten in time, so that at the end everybody is\nchecked against the database. We explore the behavior of a homogeneous system\nin the case of a fixed pool of spreaders of corrupted messages, and in the case\nof spontaneous appearance of corrupted messages."

In particular, no complete\naxiomatisation of the logic under scrutiny is needed. This does not only\ncomplement our earlier, syntactic, approach conceptually, but also covers a\nwide variety of new examples which are difficult to harness by purely syntactic\nmeans. Apart from re-proving known complexity bounds for a large variety of\nstructurally different logics, we apply our method to obtain previously unknown\nPSPACE-bounds for Elgesem's logic of agency and for graded modal logic over\nreflexive frames."

    "summary": "The biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that\ndefends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or\nmolecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with\nthe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\nfrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\nmessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\nsystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\ndestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\nto previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\nremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\nprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\nrecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\nimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\nfrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\nscience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\nimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\nmethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\nArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\nsuch problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known\nalgorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will\nround this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems\nis still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm\ntemplate and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to\ntime and from those examples given here."

The ``maximization version'' of Young's rule\nis known to be $\\NP$-hard to approximate by any constant factor. Both\napproximations are simple, and natural as rules in their own right: Given a\ncandidate we wish to score, we can regard either its Dodgson or Young score as\nthe edit distance between a given set of voter preferences and one in which the\ncandidate to be scored is the Condorcet winner. (The difference between the two\nscoring rules is the type of edits allowed.) We regard the marginal cost of a\nsequence of edits to be the number of edits divided by the number of reductions\n(in the candidate's deficit against any of its opponents in the pairwise race\nagainst that opponent) that the edits yield.

We\nshow that market organizer's decision problem for this mechanism can be\nformulated as a convex program of polynomial size. More importantly, the\nformulation yields a set of n x n unique marginal prices that are sufficient to\nprice the bets in this mechanism, and are computable in polynomial-time. The\nmarginal prices reflect the traders' beliefs about the marginal distributions\nover outcomes. We also propose techniques to compute the joint distribution\nover n! permutations from these marginal distributions. We show that using a\nmaximum entropy criterion, we can obtain a concise parametric form (with only n\nx n parameters) for the joint distribution which is defined over an\nexponentially large state space. We then present an approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the parameters of this distribution.

In such\ncontrol scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election\nvia actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.\nSP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of\ncandidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'\napproval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred\ncandidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule\ncoerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and\nhybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.\n  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the\ncorresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of\nconstructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to\ncontrol than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a\npolynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,\nsee Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the\nsecond natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that\nis known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland\nvoting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control."

    "summary": "The only systems previously known to be resistant to all the standard control\ntypes were highly artificial election systems created by hybridization. We\nstudy a parameterized version of Copeland voting, denoted by Copeland^\\alpha,\nwhere the parameter \\alpha is a rational number between 0 and 1 that specifies\nhow ties are valued in the pairwise comparisons of candidates. We prove that\nCopeland^{0.5}, the system commonly referred to as \"Copeland voting,\" provides\nfull resistance to constructive control, and we prove the same for\nCopeland^\\alpha, for all rational \\alpha, 0 < \\alpha < 1. Copeland voting is\nthe first natural election system proven to have full resistance to\nconstructive control. We also prove that both Copeland^1 (Llull elections) and\nCopeland^0 are resistant to all standard types of constructive control other\nthan one variant of addition of candidates. Moreover, we show that for each\nrational \\alpha, 0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1, Copeland^\\alpha voting is fully\nresistant to bribery attacks, and we establish fixed-parameter tractability of\nbounded-case control for Copeland^\\alpha. We also study Copeland^\\alpha\nelections under more flexible models such as microbribery and extended control\nand we integrate the potential irrationality of voter preferences into many of\nour results."

    "summary": "Recent advances in neurosciences and psychology have provided evidence that\naffective phenomena pervade intelligence at many levels, being inseparable from\nthe cognitionaction loop. Perception, attention, memory, learning,\ndecisionmaking, adaptation, communication and social interaction are some of\nthe aspects influenced by them. This work draws its inspirations from\nneurobiology, psychophysics and sociology to approach the problem of building\nautonomous robots capable of interacting with each other and building\nstrategies based on temperamental decision mechanism. Modelling emotions is a\nrelatively recent focus in artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling.\nSuch models can ideally inform our understanding of human behavior. We may see\nthe development of computational models of emotion as a core research focus\nthat will facilitate advances in the large array of computational systems that\nmodel, interpret or influence human behavior. We propose a model based on a\nscalable, flexible and modular approach to emotion which allows runtime\nevaluation between emotional quality and performance. The results achieved\nshowed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly\ninfluence the system performance and there are evident dependency between\nemotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the\ndependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of\nthe team members, and this enable us to conclude that the modular approach to\nemotional programming based on temperamental theory is the good choice to\ndevelop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems."

Such efforts lead to the emergence of language that\nallows for an efficient communication and exhibits some degree of homonymy and\nsynonymy. Although homonymy reduces the communication efficiency, it seems to\nbe a dynamical trap that persists for a long, and perhaps indefinite, time. On\nthe other hand, synonymy does not reduce the efficiency of communication, but\nappears to be only a transient feature of the language. Thus, in our model the\nrole of synonymy decreases and in the long-time limit it becomes negligible. A\nsimilar rareness of synonymy is observed in present natural languages. The role\nof noise, that distorts the communicated words, is also examined. Although, in\ngeneral, the noise reduces the communication efficiency, it also regroups the\nwords so that they are more evenly distributed within the available \"verbal\"\nspace."

In the algorithms, each data point in a\ndataset is considered as a particle which can move at random in space according\nto the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also\nviewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its\ntransition probability vector in terms of the feedbacks of all data points, and\nthen its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function.\nFinally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space,\ndata points collect gradually and some separating parts emerge among them\nautomatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are\nlocated at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are\naway from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated\nthat data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently,\nand the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

It consists of\nneural network based agents that invent ideas for actions, and imitate\nneighbors' actions. The model is based on a theory of culture according to\nwhich what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal\nmodels of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a\nDarwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving\nexchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of\nactions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of\nactions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and\ndensity, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase\nfitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by\nsharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions\nthroughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces\ndiversity of actions. Increasing the number of leaders reduces this effect.\nEfforts are underway to simulate the conditions under which an agent\nimmigrating from one culture to another contributes new ideas while still\nfitting in."

    "summary": "When a large group of pedestrians moves around a corner, most pedestrians do\nnot follow the shortest path, which is to stay as close as possible to the\ninner wall, but try to minimize the travel time. For this they accept to move\non a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and\nby this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of\npedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either \"move as far as\npossible toward the destination\" or - reformulated - \"of all coordinates\naccessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the\ndestination\". Atop of this rule modifications are placed to make the motion\nmore realistic. These modifications usually focus on local behavior and neglect\nlong-ranged effects. Compared to real pedestrians this leads to agents in a\nsimulation valuing the shortest path a lot better than the quickest. So, in a\nsituation as the movement of a large crowd around a corner, one needs an\nadditional element in a model of pedestrian dynamics that makes the agents\ndeviate from the rule of the shortest path. In this work it is shown, how this\ncan be achieved by using a flood fill dynamic potential field method, where\nduring the filling process the value of a field cell is not increased by 1, but\nby a larger value, if it is occupied by an agent. This idea may be an obvious\none, however, the tricky part - and therefore in a strict sense the\ncontribution of this work - is a) to minimize unrealistic artifacts, as naive\nflood fill metrics deviate considerably from the Euclidean metric and in this\nrespect yield large errors, b) do this with limited computational effort, and\nc) keep agents' movement at very low densities unaltered."

In this context, the multi-agents systems appear as an alternative\nto model the metabolic pathways.

We show, for\ninstance, that it may be better from a computational perspective to elicit all\npreferences from one agent at a time than to elicit individual preferences from\nmultiple agents. We also study the connection between the strategic\nmanipulation of an election and preference elicitation. We show that what we\ncan manipulate affects the computational complexity of manipulation. In\nparticular, we prove that there are voting rules which are easy to manipulate\nif we can change all of an agent's vote, but computationally intractable if we\ncan change only some of their preferences. This suggests that, as with\npreference elicitation, a fine-grained view of manipulation may be informative.\nFinally, we study the connection between predicting the winner of an election\nand preference elicitation.

Recent studies by Ciliberti et al\n(Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 2007) and Wagner (Proc. R. Soc. B., 2008) propose a\npotentially important link between the robustness and the evolvability of a\nsystem.

Here we study two design principles,\nredundancy and degeneracy, for achieving robustness and we show that they have\na dramatically different impact on the evolvability of the system. In\nparticular, purely redundant systems are found to have very little evolvability\nwhile systems with degeneracy, i.e. distributed robustness, can be orders of\nmagnitude more evolvable.

    "summary": "Dendritic cells are the crime scene investigators of the human immune system.\nTheir function is to correlate potentially anomalous invading entities with\nobserved damage to the body. The detection of such invaders by dendritic cells\nresults in the activation of the adaptive immune system, eventually leading to\nthe removal of the invader from the host body. This mechanism has provided\ninspiration for the development of a novel bio-inspired algorithm, the\nDendritic Cell Algorithm. This algorithm processes information at multiple\nlevels of resolution, resulting in the creation of information granules of\nvariable structure. In this chapter we examine the multi-faceted nature of\nimmunology and how research in this field has shaped the function of the\nresulting Dendritic Cell Algorithm. A brief overview of the algorithm is given\nin combination with the details of the processes used for its development. The\nchapter is concluded with a discussion of the parallels between our\nunderstanding of the human immune system and how such knowledge influences the\ndesign of artificial immune systems."

We study\nthe online-offline activities of avatars in an MMORPG to understand their\ngame-playing behavior. The statistical analysis unveils that the active avatars\ncan be classified into three types. The avatars of the first type are owned by\ngame cheaters who go online and offline in preset time intervals with the\nonline duration distributions dominated by pulses. The second type of avatars\nis characterized by a Weibull distribution in the online durations, which is\nconfirmed by statistical tests. The distributions of online durations of the\nremaining individual avatars differ from the above two types and cannot be\ndescribed by a simple form. These findings have potential applications in the\ngame industry."

    "summary": "We consider multi-agent systems where agents' preferences are aggregated via\nsequential majority voting: each decision is taken by performing a sequence of\npairwise comparisons where each comparison is a weighted majority vote among\nthe agents. Incompleteness in the agents' preferences is common in many\nreal-life settings due to privacy issues or an ongoing elicitation process. In\naddition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated.\nFor example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions\nbeing compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to\ndetermine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences\nmay be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is\ncomputationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may\nwin, whatever the agenda. On the other hand, it is computationally hard to know\nwheth er a candidate decision wins in at least one agenda for at least one\ncompletion of the agents' preferences. These results hold even if the agenda\nmust be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of\nmajority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference\nelicitation. They help understand the complexity of tasks such as determining\nif a decision can be taken collectively, as well as knowing if the winner can\nbe manipulated by appropriately ordering the agenda."

The problem of characterizing essential cyclicity\nin terms of graph topology is difficult and yet unsolved. Its solution is\nimportant for some applications of graph theory, including that in\ndecentralized control. In the present paper, this problem is solved with\nrespect to the class of digraphs with ring structure, which models some typical\ncommunication networks. It is shown that the digraphs in this class are\nessentially cyclic, except for certain specified digraphs. The main technical\ntool we employ is the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. A by-product of\nthis study is a theorem on the zeros of polynomials that differ by one from the\nproducts of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. We also consider the\nproblem of essential cyclicity for weighted digraphs and enumerate the spanning\ntrees in some digraphs with ring structure."

    "summary": "It is an amazing fact that remarkably complex behaviors could emerge from a\nlarge collection of very rudimentary dynamical agents through very simple local\ninteractions. However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local\ninteractions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective\nbehaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a\ndivide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through\nlocal coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team\nof three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure."

It also\nappears to be one of the harder rules to manipulate since it involves multiple\nrounds and since, unlike many other rules, it is NP-hard for a single agent to\nmanipulate without weights on the votes or uncertainty about how the other\nagents have voted. In almost every election in our experiments, it was easy to\ncompute how a single agent could manipulate the election or to prove that\nmanipulation by a single agent was impossible.

We also introduce a novel performance\nmeasure which we have created to quantify customers' satisfaction with service,\nbased on their individual shopping experiences."

    "summary": "Intelligent agents offer a new and exciting way of understanding the world of\nwork. Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), one way of using intelligent agents,\ncarries great potential for progressing our understanding of management\npractices and how they link to retail performance. We have developed simulation\nmodels based on research by a multi-disciplinary team of economists, work\npsychologists and computer scientists. We will discuss our experiences of\nimplementing these concepts working with a well-known retail department store.\nThere is no doubt that management practices are linked to the performance of an\norganisation (Reynolds et al., 2005; Wall & Wood, 2005). Best practices have\nbeen developed, but when it comes down to the actual application of these\nguidelines considerable ambiguity remains regarding their effectiveness within\nparticular contexts (Siebers et al., forthcoming a). Most Operational Research\n(OR) methods can only be used as analysis tools once management practices have\nbeen implemented. Often they are not very useful for giving answers to\nspeculative 'what-if' questions, particularly when one is interested in the\ndevelopment of the system over time rather than just the state of the system at\na certain point in time. Simulation can be used to analyse the operation of\ndynamic and stochastic systems. ABS is particularly useful when complex\ninteractions between system entities exist, such as autonomous decision making\nor negotiation. In an ABS model the researcher explicitly describes the\ndecision process of simulated actors at the micro level. Structures emerge at\nthe macro level as a result of the actions of the agents and their interactions\nwith other agents and the environment. 3 We will show how ABS experiments can\ndeal with testing and optimising management practices such as training,\nempowerment or teamwork. Hence, questions such as \"will staff setting their own\nbreak times improve performance?\" can be investigated."

Preserving user identity in the data\nset allows us to discover novel properties of Web traffic that directly affect\nmodels of hypertext navigation. We find that the popularity of Web sites -- the\nnumber of users who contribute to their traffic -- lacks any intrinsic mean and\nmay be unbounded. Further, many aspects of the browsing behavior of individual\nusers can be approximated by log-normal distributions even though their\naggregate behavior is scale-free. Finally, we show that users' click streams\ncannot be cleanly segmented into sessions using timeouts, affecting any attempt\nto model hypertext navigation using statistics of individual sessions. We\npropose a strictly logical definition of sessions based on browsing activity as\nrevealed by referrer URLs; a user may have several active sessions in their\nclick stream at any one time. We demonstrate that applying a timeout to these\nlogical sessions affects their statistics to a lesser extent than a purely\ntimeout-based mechanism."

    "summary": "Analysis of aggregate and individual Web traffic has shown that PageRank is a\npoor model of how people navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web\ntraffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both\naggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link\ntraffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model\ncurrently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show\nthat all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model\nthat takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited\nlinks, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as\nthe use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by\nvisiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more\ntopically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the\nprobability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing\nus to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of\nreproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical\ndata, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users\nwith the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result\nallows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient\nto interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data. In addition to the\ndescriptive and explanatory power of such a model, our results may lead the way\nto more sophisticated, realistic, and effective ranking and crawling\nalgorithms."

    "summary": "We consider network contribution games, where each agent in a social network\nhas a budget of effort that he can contribute to different collaborative\nprojects or relationships. Depending on the contribution of the involved agents\na relationship will flourish or drown, and to measure the success we use a\nreward function for each relationship. Every agent is trying to maximize the\nreward from all relationships that it is involved in. We consider pairwise\nequilibria of this game, and characterize the existence, computational\ncomplexity, and quality of equilibrium based on the types of reward functions\ninvolved. For example, when all reward functions are concave, we prove that the\nprice of anarchy is at most 2. For convex functions the same only holds under\nsome special but very natural conditions. A special focus of the paper are\nminimum effort games, where the reward of a relationship depends only on the\nminimum effort of any of the participants. Finally, we show tight bounds for\napproximate equilibria and convergence of dynamics in these games."

    "summary": "It is well-known that the behavior of many dynamical processes running on\nnetworks is intimately related to the eigenvalue spectrum of the network. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of inferring global information regarding\nthe eigenvalue spectrum of a network from a set of local samples of its\nstructure. In particular, we find explicit relationships between the so-called\nspectral moments of a graph and the presence of certain small subgraphs, also\ncalled motifs, in the network. Since the eigenvalues of the network have a\ndirect influence on the network dynamical behavior, our result builds a bridge\nbetween local network measurements (i.e., the presence of small subgraphs) and\nglobal dynamical behavior (via the spectral moments). Furthermore, based on our\nresult, we propose a novel decentralized scheme to compute the spectral moments\nof a network by aggregating local measurements of the network topology. Our\nfinal objective is to understand the relationships between the behavior of\ndynamical processes taking place in a large-scale complex network and its local\ntopological properties."

Each\niteration, each agent in the artificial society invents a new action, or\nimitates a neighbor's action. Only the leader's actions can be imitated by all\nother agents, referred to as followers. Two measures of creativity were used:\n(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent\ninvents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how\ncreative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but\nonly when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with\ngreater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High\ncLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;\nin the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and\ntentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed."

    "summary": "Voting is a simple mechanism to combine together the preferences of multiple\nagents. Agents may try to manipulate the result of voting by mis-reporting\ntheir preferences. One barrier that might exist to such manipulation is\ncomputational complexity. In particular, it has been shown that it is NP-hard\nto compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules. However,\nNP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results\nsuggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. In this paper, we\nstudy empirically the manipulability of single transferable voting (STV) to\ndetermine if computational complexity is really a barrier to manipulation. STV\nwas one of the first voting rules shown to be NP-hard. It also appears one of\nthe harder voting rules to manipulate. We sample a number of distributions of\nvotes including uniform and real world elections. In almost every election in\nour experiments, it was easy to compute how a single agent could manipulate the\nelection or to prove that manipulation by a single agent was impossible."

    "summary": "Agent-based modeling and simulation is a useful method to study biological\nphenomena in a wide range of fields, from molecular biology to ecology. Since\nthere is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not\nalways easy to use published models. Also, since model descriptions are not\nusually given in mathematical terms, it is difficult to bring mathematical\nanalysis tools to bear, so that models are typically studied through\nsimulation. In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol\nfor model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard\nway to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol\nwhich allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system,\nwhich provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis.\nThe mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete\ndynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several\nexamples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis."

Alternatively, discrete event and agent-based modelling\nare approaches that allow the development of simulation models of heterogeneous\nnon-equilibrium systems for testing out different scenarios. When developing\nsimulation models one has to abstract and simplify from the real world, which\nmeans that one has to try and capture the 'essence' of the system required for\ndeveloping a representation of the mechanisms that drive the progression in the\nreal system. Simulation models can be developed at different levels of\nabstraction. To know the appropriate level of abstraction for a specific\napplication is often more of an art than a science.

Both\ngenerations of algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of\nproblems, including anomaly detection, pattern recognition, optimisation and\nrobotics.

This stylized\nagent-based model captures essential features of agreement dynamics in a\nnetwork of autonomous agents, corresponding to the development of shared\nclassification schemes in a network of artificial agents or opinion spreading\nand social dynamics in social networks. Our study focuses on the impact that\ncommunities in the underlying social graphs have on the outcome of the\nagreement process. We find that networks with strong community structure hinder\nthe system from reaching global agreement; the evolution of the Naming Game in\nthese networks maintains clusters of coexisting opinions indefinitely. Further,\nwe investigate agent-based network strategies to facilitate convergence to\nglobal consensus."

    "summary": "We define an individual-based probabilistic model of a sole (Solea solea)\nbehaviour. The individual model is given in terms of an Extended Probabilistic\nDiscrete Timed Automaton (EPDTA), a new formalism that is introduced in the\npaper and that is shown to be interpretable as a Markov decision process. A\ngiven EPDTA model can be probabilistically model-checked by giving a suitable\ntranslation into syntax accepted by existing model-checkers. In order to\nsimulate the dynamics of a given population of soles in different environmental\nscenarios, an agent-based simulation environment is defined in which each agent\nimplements the behaviour of the given EPDTA model. By varying the probabilities\nand the characteristic functions embedded in the EPDTA model it is possible to\nrepresent different scenarios and to tune the model itself by comparing the\nresults of the simulations with real data about the sole stock in the North\nAdriatic sea, available from the recent project SoleMon. The simulator is\npresented and made available for its adaptation to other species."

    "summary": "New operating systems for mobile devices allow their users to download\nmillions of applications created by various individual programmers, some of\nwhich may be malicious or flawed. In order to detect that an application is\nmalicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant\nperiod of time is often required. Mobile devices have limited computation and\npower resources and thus are limited in their monitoring capabilities. In this\npaper we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses\nthe collective resources of many mobile devices, \"vaccinating\" them against\npotentially unsafe applications. We suggest a new local information flooding\nalgorithm called \"TTL Probabilistic Propagation\" (TPP). The algorithm\nperiodically monitors one or more application and reports its conclusions to a\nsmall number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information\nonwards. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform existing state\nof the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as\nwell as network overhead. The maximal \"load\" of the algorithm (the fastest\narrival rate of new suspicious applications, that can still guarantee complete\nmonitoring), is analytically calculated and shown to be significantly superior\ncompared to any non-collaborative approach. Finally, we show both analytically\nand experimentally using real world network data that implementing the proposed\nalgorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. In\naddition, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to several types\nof Byzantine attacks where some adversarial agents may generate false\ninformation, or abuse the algorithm in other ways."

    "summary": "The eigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a network is closely\nrelated to the behavior of many dynamical processes run over the network. In\nthe field of robotics, this spectrum has important implications in many\nproblems that require some form of distributed coordination within a team of\nrobots. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time control scheme that\nmodifies the structure of a position-dependent network of mobile robots so that\nit achieves a desired set of adjacency eigenvalues. For this, we employ a novel\nabstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum by means of the adjacency matrix\nspectral moments. Since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by its\nspectral moments, this abstraction provides a way to indirectly control the\neigenvalues of the network. Our construction is based on artificial potentials\nthat capture the distance of the network's spectral moments to their desired\nvalues. Minimization of these potentials is via a gradient descent closed-loop\nsystem that, under certain convexity assumptions, ensures convergence of the\nnetwork topology to one with the desired set of moments and, therefore,\neigenvalues. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations."

Their\ndecision depends on the trade-off between their perceived risk of being\ninfected and the cost of being protected. The network members can make\ndecisions repeatedly, based on information that they receive about the changing\ninfection level in the network.\n  We study the equilibrium states reached by a network whose members increase\n(resp. decrease) their security deployment when learning that the network\ninfection is widespread (resp. limited). Our main finding is that the\nequilibrium level of infection increases as the learning rate of the members\nincreases. We confirm this result in three scenarios for the behavior of the\nmembers: strictly rational cost minimizers, not strictly rational, and strictly\nrational but split into two response classes. In the first two cases, we\ncompletely characterize the stability and the domains of attraction of the\nequilibrium points, even though the first case leads to a differential\ninclusion.

    "summary": "We study policies aiming to minimize the weighted sum of completion times of\njobs in the context of coordination mechanisms for selfish scheduling problems.\nOur goal is to design local policies that achieve a good price of anarchy in\nthe resulting equilibria for unrelated machine scheduling. To obtain the\napproximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually\nsimple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the\nfollowing results.\n  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in\nascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an\napproximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible\nfor deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is\nalways optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then\nshow that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or\nrandomization is allowed.\n  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,\nachieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation\nratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is\nnegligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \\pi\n/2.\n  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential\ngames, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule). This\nalso allows us to design the first \\emph{combinatorial} constant-factor\napproximation algorithm minimizing weighted completion time for unrelated\nmachine scheduling that achieves a factor of 2+ \\epsilon for any \\epsilon > 0."

However, agent coalitions are not always\na desirable feature of a system, as malicious or corrupt agents may collaborate\nin order to subvert or attack the system. In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of hidden coalitions, whose existence and the purposes they aim to\nachieve are not known to the system, and which carry out so-called underhand\nattacks. We give a first approach to hidden coalitions by introducing a\ndeterministic method that blocks the actions of potentially dangerous agents,\ni.e. possibly belonging to such coalitions. We also give a non-deterministic\nversion of this method that blocks the smallest set of potentially dangerous\nagents. We calculate the computational cost of our two blocking methods, and\nprove their soundness and completeness."

A desired property in this\nsystems is the ability of the team members to work together to achieve a common\ngoal in a cooperative manner. The aim is to define a systematic method to\nverify the effective collaboration among the members of a team and comparing\nthe different multi-agent behaviours. Using external observations of a\nMulti-Agent System to analyse, model, recognize agent behaviour could be very\nuseful to direct team actions. In particular, this report focuses on the\nchallenge of autonomous unsupervised sequential learning of the team's\nbehaviour from observations. Our approach allows to learn a symbolic sequence\n(a relational representation) to translate raw multi-agent, multi-variate\nobservations of a dynamic, complex environment, into a set of sequential\nbehaviours that are characteristic of the team in question, represented by a\nset of sequences expressed in first-order logic atoms. We propose to use a\nrelational learning algorithm to mine meaningful frequent patterns among the\nrelational sequences to characterise team behaviours. We compared the\nperformance of two teams in the RoboCup four-legged league environment, that\nhave a very different approach to the game. One uses a Case Based Reasoning\napproach, the other uses a pure reactive behaviour."

    "summary": "A natural way for cooperative tasking in multi-agent systems is through a\ntop-down design by decomposing a global task into sub-tasks for each individual\nagent such that the accomplishments of these sub-tasks will guarantee the\nachievement of the global task. In our previous works [1], [2] we presented\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on the decomposability of a global task\nautomaton between cooperative agents. As a follow-up work, this paper deals\nwith the robustness issues of the proposed top-down design approach with\nrespect to event failures in the multi-agent systems. The main concern under\nevent failure is whether a previously decomposable task can still be achieved\ncollectively by the agents, and if not, we would like to investigate that under\nwhat conditions the global task could be robustly accomplished. This is\nactually the fault-tolerance issue of the top-down design, and the results\nprovide designers with hints on which events are fragile with respect to\nfailures, and whether redundancies are needed. The main objective of this paper\nis to identify necessary and sufficient conditions on failed events under which\na decomposable global task can still be achieved successfully. For such a\npurpose, a notion called passivity is introduced to characterize the type of\nevent failures. The passivity is found to reflect the redundancy of\ncommunication links over shared events, based on which necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the reliability of cooperative tasking under event failures are\nderived, followed by illustrative examples and remarks for the derived\nconditions."

    "summary": "In this paper, we develop new methods for the analysis of decentralized\ncontrol systems and we apply them to formation control problems. The basic\nset-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of\na graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We\naddress the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is\nsufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is\nconcerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given\ndistance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes\nboth the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths\nof the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously\ndeformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally\nrigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its\nrigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just\nenough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle\nis whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is\nsufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in\nthe case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic\nproperties of formation control in the plane. Formations and the associated\ncontrol problems are defined modulo rigid transformations. This fact has strong\nimplications on the geometry of the space of formations and on the feedback\nlaws, since they need to respect this invariance. We study both aspects here.\nWe show that the space of frameworks of n agents is CP(n-2) x (0,\\infty). We\nthen illustrate how the non-trivial topology of this space relates to the\nparametrization of the formation by inter-agent distances."

We introduce new methods to understand these\naspects of decentralized control. Precisely, we introduce a framework to\ncapture what agents with partial information can achieve by cooperating and\nillustrate its use by deriving results about global stabilization of directed\nformations. This framework underscores the need to differentiate the knowledge\nan agent has about the task to accomplish from the knowledge an agent has about\nthe current state of the system. The control of directed formations has proven\nto be more difficult than initially thought, as is exemplified by the lack of\nglobal result for formations with n \\geq 4 agents. We established in part I\nthat the space of planar formations has a non-trivial global topology. We\npropose here an extension of the notion of global stability which, because it\nacknowledges this non-trivial topology, can be applied to the study of\nformation control. We then develop a framework that reduces the question of\nwhether feedback with partial information can stabilize the system to whether\ntwo sets of functions intersect. We apply this framework to the study of a\ndirected formation with n = 4 agents and show that the agents do not have\nenough information to implement locally stabilizing feedback laws.\nAdditionally, we show that feedback laws that respect the information flow\ncannot stabilize a target configuration without stabilizing other, unwanted\nconfigurations."

Here we address this question in\nthe framework of the emergence of shared linguistic categories in a population\nof individuals interacting through language games. The observed emerging\nasymptotic categorization, which has been previously tested - with success -\nagainst experimental data from human languages, corresponds to a metastable\nstate where global shifts are always possible but progressively more unlikely\nand the response properties depend on the age of the system. This aging\nmechanism exhibits striking quantitative analogies to what is observed in the\nstatistical mechanics of glassy systems. We argue that this can be a general\nscenario in language dynamics where shared linguistic conventions would not\nemerge as attractors, but rather as metastable states."

    "summary": "A theorem on (partial) convergence to consensus of multiagent systems is\npresented. It is proven with tools studying the convergence properties of\nproducts of row stochastic matrices with positive diagonals which are infinite\nto the left. Thus, it can be seen as a switching linear system in discrete\ntime. It is further shown that the result is strictly more general than results\nof Moreau (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 50, no. 2, 2005),\nalthough Moreau's results are formulated for generally nonlinear updating maps.\nThis is shown by demonstrating the existence of an appropriate switching linear\nsystem which mimics the nonlinear updating maps. Further on, an example system\nis given for which convergence to consensus can be shown by using the theorem.\nIn this system the lengths of intercommunication intervals in the switching\ncommunication topology grows without bound. This makes other theorems not\napplicable."

    "summary": "Since the information available is fundamental for our perceptions and\nopinions, we are interested in understanding the conditions allowing for a good\ninformation to be disseminated. This paper explores opinion dynamics by means\nof multi-agent based simulations when agents get informed by different sources\nof information. The scenario implemented includes three main streams of\ninformation acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived\nreliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either\nby accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by\nexchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive\nmechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information. We\nexpect that peer-to--peer communication and reliable information sources are\nable both to reduce biased perceptions and to inhibit information cheating,\npossibly performed by the media as stated by the agenda-setting theory. In the\npaper, after having shortly presented both the hypotheses and the model, the\nsimulation design will be specified and results will be discussed with respect\nto the hypotheses. Some considerations and ideas for future studies will\nconclude the paper."

The potential for exploiting these properties in digital\necosystems is considered, suggesting how several key features of biological\necosystems can be exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking\nthese features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising\narchitectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in\ndetail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through\nsimulations, considering the self-organised diversity of its evolving agent\npopulations relative to the user request behaviour."

    "summary": "Recent research in multi-robot exploration and mapping has focused on\nsampling environmental fields, which are typically modeled using the Gaussian\nprocess (GP). Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for\nlearning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem\nstructure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of\nobservations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these\nstrategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational\nburden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient\ninformation-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We\nanalyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem,\nand demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the\nnon-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a\nclass of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based\npolicy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task\nsettings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to\nviolation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world\ntemperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy\ncan generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the\nwidely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field\nconditions and task settings while enjoying significant computational gain over\nthem."

    "summary": "We consider a set of agents who are attempting to iteratively learn the\n'state of the world' from their neighbors in a social network. Each agent\ninitially receives a noisy observation of the true state of the world. The\nagents then repeatedly 'vote' and observe the votes of some of their peers,\nfrom which they gain more information. The agents' calculations are Bayesian\nand aim to myopically maximize the expected utility at each iteration.\n  This model, introduced by Gale and Kariv (2003), is a natural approach to\nlearning on networks. However, it has been criticized, chiefly because the\nagents' decision rule appears to become computationally intractable as the\nnumber of iterations advances. For instance, a dynamic programming approach\n(part of this work) has running time that is exponentially large in \\min(n,\n(d-1)^t), where n is the number of agents.\n  We provide a new algorithm to perform the agents' computations on locally\ntree-like graphs. Our algorithm uses the dynamic cavity method to drastically\nreduce computational effort. Let d be the maximum degree and t be the iteration\nnumber. The computational effort needed per agent is exponential only in O(td)\n(note that the number of possible information sets of a neighbor at time t is\nitself exponential in td).\n  Under appropriate assumptions on the rate of convergence, we deduce that each\nagent is only required to spend polylogarithmic (in 1/\\eps) computational\neffort to approximately learn the true state of the world with error\nprobability \\eps, on regular trees of degree at least five. We provide\nnumerical and other evidence to justify our assumption on convergence rate.\n  We extend our results in various directions, including loopy graphs. Our\nresults indicate efficiency of iterative Bayesian social learning in a wide\nrange of situations, contrary to widely held beliefs."

In a recent work Blum and Sadler [1] propose the idea of ordered\ntransmissions -sensors with more informative samples deliver their messages\nfirst- and prove that optimal detection performance can be achieved using only\na subset of the total messages. Taking to one extreme this approach, we show\nthat just a single delivering allows making the detection errors as small as\ndesired, for a sufficiently large network size: a one-bit detection scheme can\nbe asymptotically consistent. The transmission ordering is based on the modulus\nof some local statistic (MO system). We derive analytical results proving the\nasymptotic consistency and, for the particular case that the local statistic is\nthe log-likelihood (\\ell-MO system), we also obtain a bound on the error\nconvergence rate.

It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into\npolynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along\nsome axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.\nThere are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely\nbe nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of\nmanipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked\nelectorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We\nprovide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action\ncomplexity up to $\\np$-hardness, but we also provide many instances where a\nreasonable number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the\nmanipulative-action complexity."

    "summary": "Scoring rules for eliciting expert predictions of random variables are\nusually developed assuming that experts derive utility only from the quality of\ntheir predictions (e.g., score awarded by the rule, or payoff in a prediction\nmarket). We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a\ndecision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and\n(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a\ncorporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility\nfrom the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually\nhave an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the\ndecision maker if typical scoring rules are used. We develop a general model\nfor this setting and introduce the concept of a compensation rule. When\ncombined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule\ninduces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming\nfull knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all\n(strictly) proper compensation rules. We then analyze the situation where the\nexpert's utility function is not fully known to the decision maker. We show\nbounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert\nwill misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty.\nThese bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local\ndegree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the\ndecision maker's utility function. They also suggest optimization procedures\nfor the design of compensation rules. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of\ncompensation rules as market scoring rules for self-interested experts in a\nprediction market."

The iterative long-term interaction is characterized by\nstable points of the wireless network called equilibria. The interest in these\nequilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they\ncan be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To\nachieve these equilibria, several learning techniques, namely, the best\nresponse dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, and regret matching, are discussed in terms of information\nrequirements and convergence properties. Most of the notions introduced here,\nfor both equilibria and learning schemes, are illustrated by a simple case\nstudy, namely, an interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs."

    "summary": "New advances in large scale distributed systems have amazingly offered\ncomplex functionalities through parallelism of simple and rudimentary\ncomponents. The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the\nsynthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the\nentire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,\nthree fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for\ntop-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down\ndesign, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite\nof some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an\nundecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework. The\nfirst two problems have been addressed in our previous works, by identifying\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for task automaton decomposition, and\nfault-tolerant task decomposability. This paper deals with the third problem\nand proposes a procedure to redistribute the events among agents in order to\nenforce decomposability of an undecomposable task automaton. The\ndecomposability conditions are used to identify the root causes of\nundecomposability which are found to be due to over-communications that have to\nbe deleted, while respecting the fault-tolerant decomposability conditions; or\nbecause of the lack of communications that require new sharing of events, while\nconsidering new violations of decomposability conditions. This result provides\na sufficient condition to make any undecomposable deterministic task automaton\ndecomposable in order to facilitate cooperative tasking. Illustrative examples\nare presented to show the concept of task automaton decomposabilization."

Given such an\ninformation set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the\nmanipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and\nsometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully.\nWhen the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there\nexists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known\nresults). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no\ndominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's\ninformation is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the\npreferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for\nmany common voting rules.

The Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems (DFS) are introduced as an extension\nof scalar fuzzy difference equations and some conditions for their stability\nand representation are provided. The proposed framework is then applied in the\nfield of Critical Infrastructures; the consensus framework is used to represent\na scenario where human operators, each able to observe directly the state of a\ngiven infrastructure (or of a given area considering vast and geographically\ndispersed infrastructures), reach an agreement on the overall situation, whose\nseverity is expressed in a linguistic, fuzzy way; conversely synchronization is\nused to provide a distributed interdependency estimation system, where an array\nof interdependency models is synchronized via partial observation."

    "summary": "In the many transitions from foraging to agropastoralism it is debated\nwhether the primary drivers are innovations in technology or increases of\npopulation. The driver discussion traditionally separates Malthusian\n(technology driven) from Boserupian (population driven) theories. I present a\nnumerical model of the transitions to agriculture and discuss this model in the\nlight of the population versus technology debate and in Boserup's analytical\nframework in development theory. Although my model is based on ecological\n-Neomalthusian- principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship\nbetween technology and population results in a seemingly Boserupian response:\ninnovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not\nonly visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a\ncorresponding \"real world\" simulator which was tested against archaeological\ndata, demonstrating the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model. The\nlesson to be learned is that not all that acts Boserupian needs Boserup at its\ncore."

At each time step, simply determined by a Bernoulli trial, each agent\nindependently and randomly chooses either taking an average among its neighbor\nset, or projecting onto the optimal solution set of its own optimization\ncomponent. Both directed and bidirectional communication graphs are studied.\nConnectivity conditions are proposed to guarantee an optimal consensus almost\nsurely with proper convexity and intersection assumptions. The convergence\nanalysis is carried out using convex analysis. We compare the randomized\nalgorithm with the deterministic one via a numerical example.

This paper presents a hybrid supervisory control framework\nfor the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmanned\nhelicopters. The proposed hybrid control framework captures internal\ninteractions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuous\ndynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. To\ndesign such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space is\nproposed as a new method of abstraction. Utilizing the properties of\nmulti-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite state\nDiscrete Event System (DES) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to the\noriginal continuous-variable dynamical system. Then, in the discrete domain, a\nlogic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. Due to the\nbisimilarity between the abstracted DES model and the original UAV dynamics,\nthe designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller through\nan interface layer. This supervisor drives the UAV dynamics to satisfy the\ndesign requirements. In other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring the\nUAVs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside the\ncontrol horizon and then, maintain the formation. Moreover, a collision\navoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. Finally, the\nalgorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,\nwhich is developed for unmanned helicopters. The presented results show the\neffectiveness of the algorithm."

    "summary": "Research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts\nparadigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act\nmodels of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for\ncommunication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be\nextremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent\ncommunication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics\ntypically make reference to the \"mental states\" of agents (their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such\nattitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming\nlanguages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone\nversions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to\ncommunication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather\nad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to\nspeech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a\nlogic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of\nthe PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural\noperational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The\nmain contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier\nwork on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a\ncomputationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in\nspeech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of\nAgentSpeak that supports agent communication."

We are interested\nin scenarios when the information exchange among the agents is restricted. In\nparticular, we consider that each agent can exchange information with its\nneighbors only once per dynamical system evolution-step. Existing work with\nsimilar information-constraints is restricted to static parameter estimation,\nwhereas, the work on dynamical systems assumes large number of information\nexchange iterations between every two consecutive system evolution steps.\n  We show that when the agent communication network is sparely-connected, the\nsparsity of the network plays a key role in the stability and performance of\nthe underlying estimation algorithm. To this end, we introduce the notion of\n\\emph{Network Tracing Capacity} (NTC), which is defined as the largest two-norm\nof the system matrix that can be estimated with bounded error. Extending this\nto fully-connected networks or infinite information exchanges (per dynamical\nsystem evolution-step), we note that the NTC is infinite, i.e., any dynamical\nsystem can be estimated with bounded error. In short, the NTC characterizes the\nestimation capability of a sparse network by relating it to the evolution of\nthe underlying dynamical system."

    "summary": "We address the problem of distributed matching of features in networks with\nvision systems. Every camera in the network has limited communication\ncapabilities and can only exchange local matches with its neighbors. We propose\na distributed algorithm that takes these local matches and computes global\ncorrespondences by a proper propagation in the network. When the algorithm\nfinishes, each camera knows the global correspondences between its features and\nthe features of all the cameras in the network. The presence of spurious\nintroduced by the local matcher may produce inconsistent global\ncorrespondences, which are association paths between features from the same\ncamera. The contributions of this work are the propagation of the local matches\nand the detection and resolution of these inconsistencies by deleting local\nmatches. Our resolution algorithm considers the quality of each local match,\nwhen this information is provided by the local matcher. We formally prove that\nafter executing the algorithm, the network finishes with a global data\nassociation free of inconsistencies. We provide a fully decentralized solution\nto the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology.\nSimulations and experimental results with real images show the performance of\nthe method considering different features, matching functions and scenarios."

One of the most common learning techniques in game theory is\nfictitious play. However fictitious play is founded on an implicit assumption\nthat opponents' strategies are stationary. We present a novel variation of\nfictitious play that allows the use of a more realistic model of opponent\nstrategy. It uses a heuristic approach, from the online streaming data\nliterature, to adaptively update the weights assigned to recently observed\nactions. We compare the results of the proposed algorithm with those of\nstochastic and geometric fictitious play in a simple strategic form game, a\nvehicle target assignment game and a disaster management problem. In all the\ntests the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm was similar or better\nthan the variations of fictitious play we compared it with.

We consider how these measures\nscale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in\n1, 2 and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1\ndimensional case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension\nimplies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3\nbeing necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations\nunder certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have\nlarge coherent one dimensional vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We\nanalyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion,\nshowing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting\nin an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in\nlow spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale\ndisturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is\ndistinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly\nencountered in control problems for automated highways."

We also identify a class of\nconvex problems for double-integrators by restricting the controller to\nsymmetric position and uniform diagonal velocity gains. To obtain the optimal\nnon-symmetric gains for both the single- and the double-integrator models, we\nsolve a parameterized family of optimal control problems ranging from an easily\nsolvable problem to the problem of interest as the underlying parameter\nincreases. When this parameter is kept small, we employ perturbation analysis\nto decouple the matrix equations that result from the optimality conditions,\nthereby rendering the unique optimal feedback gain. This solution is used to\ninitialize a homotopy-based Newton's method to find the optimal localized gain.\nTo investigate the performance of localized controllers, we examine how the\ncoherence of large-scale stochastically forced formations scales with the\nnumber of vehicles.

    "summary": "In open systems verification, to formally check for reliability, one needs an\nappropriate formalism to model the interaction between agents and express the\ncorrectness of the system no matter how the environment behaves. An important\ncontribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in\nthe setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\\star, and the like.\nRecently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which\nwe denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for\nreasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order\nquantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific\nsetting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking\nalgorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim\nthat it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,\nfor reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that\nSL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In\nparticular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the\nbest one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is\nNonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate\nhere syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\\star, with the hope of\nobtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the\nsublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special\nprenex normal form having, respectively, nested temporal goals, Boolean\ncombinations of goals and, a single goal at a time. About these logics, we\nprove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2ExpTime-complete, thus not\nharder than the one for ATL\\star."

    "summary": "Opinion Dynamics models can be, for most of them, divided between discrete\nand continuous. They are used in different circumstances and the relationship\nbetween them is not clear. Here we will explore the relationship between a\nmodel where choices are discrete but opinions are a continuous function (the\nContinuous Opinions and Discrete Actions, CODA, model) and traditional discrete\nmodels. I will show that, when CODA is altered to include reasoning about the\ninfluence one agent can have on its own neighbors, agreement and disagreement\nno longer have the same importance. The limit when an agent considers itself to\nbe more and more influential will be studied and we will see that one recovers\ndiscrete dynamics, like those of the Voter model in that limit"

Key challenges in\nkeepaway are the high-dimensionality of the state space (rendering conventional\ndiscretization-based function approximation like tilecoding infeasible), the\nstochasticity due to noise and multiple learning agents needing to cooperate\n(meaning that the exact dynamics of the environment are unknown) and real-time\nlearning (meaning that an efficient online implementation is required). We\nemploy the general framework of approximate policy iteration with\nleast-squares-based policy evaluation. As underlying function approximator we\nconsider the family of regularization networks with subset of regressors\napproximation. The core of our proposed solution is an efficient recursive\nimplementation with automatic supervised selection of relevant basis functions.\nSimulation results indicate that the behavior learned through our approach\nclearly outperforms the best results obtained earlier with tilecoding by Stone\net al.

    "summary": "Several Mobile Agent based distributed network management models have been\nproposed in recent times to address the scalability and flexibility problems of\ncentralized (SNMP or CMIP management models) models. Though the use of Mobile\nAgents to distribute and delegate management tasks comes handy in dealing with\nthe previously stated issues, many of the agent-based management frameworks\nlike initial flat bed models and static mid-level managers employing mobile\nagents models cannot efficiently meet the demands of current networks which are\ngrowing in size and complexity. Moreover, varied technologies, such as SONET,\nATM, Ethernet, DWDM etc., present at different layers of the Access, Metro and\nCore (long haul) sections of the network, have contributed to the complexity in\nterms of their own framing and protocol structures. Thus, controlling and\nmanaging the traffic in these networks is a challenging task. This paper\npresents an intelligent scalable hierarchical agent based model for the\nmanagement of large-scale complex networks to address aforesaid issues. The\ncost estimation, carried out with a view to compute the overall management cost\nin terms of management data overhead, is being presented. The results obtained\nthereafter establish the usefulness of the presented architecture as compare to\ncentralized and flat bed agent based models."

Furthermore, countermeasures that block malicious transit traffic\nappear more effective than ones that block outgoing traffic. The model allows\nus to quantify and compare positive externalities created by different\ncountermeasures.

Our main result is that they probably do differ: If\ninteger factoring is hard, then for election manipulation, election bribery,\nand some types of election control, there are election systems for which\nrecognizing which instances can be successfully manipulated is in polynomial\ntime but producing the successful manipulations cannot be done in polynomial\ntime."

Yet we also show\nthat for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is\nsimple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,\none should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's\nvoting rule. Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that,\ndepending on the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation\nproblem can be complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for\nPSPACE. We obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the\nnonunique-winner and unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for\nplurality is in P in the nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive\ncase) and NP-hard (destructive case) in the unique-winner model.

We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential\nelections. We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the\nstandard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient\nwinner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is\nPSPACE-complete, even if there are only two candidates. In addition, we obtain\n(by a new characterization of coNP in terms of weight-bounded alternating\nTuring machines) completeness for coNP in the deleting/adding cases with a\nbounded deletion/addition limit, and we obtain completeness for NP in the\npartition cases with an additional restriction.

Such an experimental approach is sorely missing for NP-hard control\nproblems, where control refers to attempts to tamper with the outcome of\nelections by adding/deleting/partitioning either voters or candidates. We\nexperimentally tackle NP-hard control problems for Bucklin and fallback voting.\nAmong natural voting systems with efficient winner determination, fallback\nvoting is currently known to display the broadest resistance to control in\nterms of NP-hardness, and Bucklin voting has been shown to behave almost as\nwell in terms of control resistance [ER10, EPR11, EFPR11]. We also investigate\ncontrol resistance experimentally for plurality voting, one of the first voting\nsystems analyzed with respect to electoral control [BTT92, HHR07]. Our findings\nindicate that NP-hard control problems can often be solved effectively in\npractice.

For in many scenarios it is\nnot feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory\noutcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and\nefficiency measures.\n  We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness\nconcept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair\nsolution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful\nfashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful\nmechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use\na strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a\ngood approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of\nour mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum\ndemand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the\nmassive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.\n  With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the\napproximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social\nwelfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case. We surpass\nthis lower bound by designing a non-swap-dictatorial mechanism for this case.\nInterestingly, the new mechanism builds on the notion of proportional fairness."

More often than not, the actions of some agents are dependent on\nthe previous execution (if not also on the outcome) of the actions of other\nagents. The resulting interdependencies between the timings of the actions of\nthe various agents give rise to the study of methods for timely coordination of\nthese actions.\n  In this work, we formulate and mathematically analyze \"Timely-Coordinated\nResponse\" - a novel multi-agent coordination problem in which the time\ndifference between each pair of actions may be constrained by upper and/or\nlower bounds. This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied\nby Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.\n  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a\ngeneralization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a\ngeneralization of the \"syncausality\" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses. We\nconstructively show the equivalence of the solutions yielded by both\napproaches, and by combining them, derive strengthened versions of known\nresults for some previously-defined special cases of this problem.\n  Our analysis is conducted under minimal assumptions: we work in a\ncontinuous-time model with possibly infinitely many agents. The general results\nwe obtain for this model reduce to stronger ones for discrete-time models with\nonly finitely many agents. In order to distill the properties of such models\nthat are significant to this reduction, we define several classes of\nnaturally-occurring models, which in a sense separate the different results. We\npresent both a more practical optimal solution, as well as a surprisingly\nsimple condition for solvability, for timely coordinated response under these\nmodels.\n  Finally, we show how our results generalize the results known for\npreviously-studied special cases of this problem."

The robots can mark\nvisited places with pheromone marks and sense the level of the pheromone in\ntheir local neighborhood. In case of multiple robots these pheromone marks can\nbe sensed by all robots and provide the only way of (indirect) communication\nbetween the robots. The robots are assumed to be memoryless, and to have no\nglobal information such as the domain map, their own position (either absolute\nor relative), total marked area percentage, maximal pheromone level, etc..\nDespite the robots' simplicity, we show that they are able, by running a very\nsimple rule of behavior, to ensure efficient covering of arbitrary connected\ndomains, including non-planar and multidimensional ones. The novelty of our\nalgorithm lies in the fact that, unlike previously proposed methods, our\nalgorithm works on continuous domains without relying on some \"induced\"\nunderlying graph, that effectively reduces the problem to a discrete case of\ngraph covering. The algorithm guarantees complete coverage of any connected\ndomain. We also prove that the algorithm is noise immune, i.e., it is able to\ncope with any initial pheromone profile (noise). In addition the algorithm\nprovides a bounded constant time between two successive visits of the robot,\nand thus, is suitable for patrolling or surveillance applications."

    "summary": "Recently, a theory for stochastic optimal control in non-linear dynamical\nsystems in continuous space-time has been developed (Kappen, 2005). We apply\nthis theory to collaborative multi-agent systems. The agents evolve according\nto a given non-linear dynamics with additive Wiener noise. Each agent can\ncontrol its own dynamics. The goal is to minimize the accumulated joint cost,\nwhich consists of a state dependent term and a term that is quadratic in the\ncontrol. We focus on systems of non-interacting agents that have to distribute\nthemselves optimally over a number of targets, given a set of end-costs for the\ndifferent possible agent-target combinations. We show that optimal control is\nthe combinatorial sum of independent single-agent single-target optimal\ncontrols weighted by a factor proportional to the end-costs of the different\ncombinations. Thus, multi-agent control is related to a standard graphical\nmodel inference problem. The additional computational cost compared to\nsingle-agent control is exponential in the tree-width of the graph specifying\nthe combinatorial sum times the number of targets. We illustrate the result by\nsimulations of systems with up to 42 agents."

    "summary": "Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution arises as the statistical equilibrium\nprobability distribution of money among the agents of a closed economic system\nwhere random and undirected exchanges are allowed. When considering a model\nwith uniform savings in the exchanges, the final distribution is close to the\ngamma family. In this work, we implement these exchange rules on networks and\nwe find that these stationary probability distributions are robust and they are\nnot affected by the topology of the underlying network. We introduce a new\nfamily of interactions: random but directed ones. In this case, it is found the\ntopology to be determinant and the mean money per economic agent is related to\nthe degree of the node representing the agent in the network. The relation\nbetween the mean money per economic agent and its degree is shown to be linear."

    "summary": "The dynamics of an agreement protocol interacting with a disagreement process\nover a common random network is considered. The model can represent the\nspreading of true and false information over a communication network, the\npropagation of faults in a large-scale control system, or the development of\ntrust and mistrust in a society. At each time instance and with a given\nprobability, a pair of network nodes are selected to interact. At random each\nof the nodes then updates its state towards the state of the other node\n(attraction), away from the other node (repulsion), or sticks to its current\nstate (neglect). Agreement convergence and disagreement divergence results are\nobtained for various strengths of the updates for both symmetric and asymmetric\nupdate rules. Impossibility theorems show that a specific level of attraction\nis required for almost sure asymptotic agreement and a specific level of\nrepulsion is required for almost sure asymptotic disagreement. A series of\nsufficient and/or necessary conditions are then established for agreement\nconvergence or disagreement divergence. In particular, under symmetric updates,\na critical convergence measure in the attraction and repulsion update strength\nis found, in the sense that the asymptotic property of the network state\nevolution transits from agreement convergence to disagreement divergence when\nthis measure goes from negative to positive. The result can be interpreted as a\ntight bound on how much bad action needs to be injected in a dynamic network in\norder to consistently steer its overall behavior away from consensus."

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider networked estimation of linear, discrete-time\ndynamical systems monitored by a network of agents. In order to minimize the\npower requirement at the (possibly, battery-operated) agents, we require that\nthe agents can exchange information with their neighbors only \\emph{once per\ndynamical system time-step}; in contrast to consensus-based estimation where\nthe agents exchange information until they reach a consensus. It can be\nverified that with this restriction on information exchange, measurement fusion\nalone results in an unbounded estimation error at every such agent that does\nnot have an observable set of measurements in its neighborhood. To over come\nthis challenge, state-estimate fusion has been proposed to recover the system\nobservability. However, we show that adding state-estimate fusion may not\nrecover observability when the system matrix is structured-rank ($S$-rank)\ndeficient.\n  In this context, we characterize the state-estimate fusion and measurement\nfusion under both full $S$-rank and $S$-rank deficient system matrices."

    "summary": "Temporal epistemic logic is a well-established framework for expressing\nagents knowledge and how it evolves over time. Within language-based security\nthese are central issues, for instance in the context of declassification. We\npropose to bring these two areas together. The paper presents a computational\nmodel and an epistemic temporal logic used to reason about knowledge acquired\nby observing program outputs. This approach is shown to elegantly capture\nstandard notions of noninterference and declassification in the literature as\nwell as information flow properties where sensitive and public data intermingle\nin delicate ways."

    "summary": "We consider a setting in which a single item of content (such as a song or a\nvideo clip) is disseminated in a population of mobile nodes by opportunistic\ncopying when pairs of nodes come in radio contact. We propose and study models\nthat capture the joint evolution of the population of nodes interested in the\ncontent (referred to as destinations), and the population of nodes that possess\nthe content. The evolution of interest in the content is captured using an\ninfluence spread model and the content spread occurs via epidemic copying.\nNodes not yet interested in the content are called relays; the influence spread\nprocess converts relays into destinations. We consider the decentralized\nsetting, where interest in the content and the spread of the content evolve by\npairwise interactions between the mobiles. We derive fluid limits for the joint\nevolution models and obtain optimal policies for copying to relay nodes in\norder to deliver content to a desired fraction of destinations. We prove that a\ntime-threshold policy is optimal while copying to relays. We then provide\ninsights into the effects of various system parameters on the co-evolution\nmodel through simulations."
