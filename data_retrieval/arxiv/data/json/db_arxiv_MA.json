    "publish": "2003-06-20T15:12:22Z", 
    "summary": "We present a method for solving service allocation problems in which a set of\nservices must be allocated to a set of agents so as to maximize a global\nutility. The method is completely distributed so it can scale to any number of\nservices without degradation. We first formalize the service allocation problem\nand then present a simple hill-climbing, a global hill-climbing, and a\nbidding-protocol algorithm for solving it. We analyze the expected performance\nof these algorithms as a function of various problem parameters such as the\nbranching factor and the number of agents. Finally, we use the sensor\nallocation problem, an instance of a service allocation problem, to show the\nbidding protocol at work. The simulations also show that phase transition on\nthe expected quality of the solution exists as the amount of communication\nbetween agents increases.",

The language is a fast, object-oriented and\neasy to learn. However, the language is less well known than, less expressive\nthan, and lacks support for many important features of C++ (eg. OpenMP for high\nperformance computing application). In this paper, we present a methodology and\nsoftware tools that we have developed for auto generating an Objective-C object\ntemplate (and all the necessary interfacing functions) from a given C++ model,\nutilising the Classdesc's object description technology, so that the C++ model\ncan both be run and accessed under the Objective-C and C++ environments.

As shown in recent studies, compromise\nmay facilitate coalition formation and increase agent utilities. In this study\nwe leverage on those new results. We devise a novel coalition formation\nmechanism that enhances compromise. Our mechanism can utilize information on\ntask dependencies to reduce formation complexity. Further, it works well with\nboth cardinal and ordinal task values. Via experiments we show that the use of\nthe suggested compromise-based coalition formation mechanism provides\nsignificant savings in the computation and communication complexity of\ncoalition formation. Our results also show that when information on task\ndependencies is used, the complexity of coalition formation is further reduced.\nWe demonstrate successful use of the mechanism for collaborative information\nfiltering, where agents combine linguistic rules to analyze documents'\ncontents.",

    "summary": "The recent commercial launch of twin-deck Very Large Transport Aircraft\n(VLTA) such as the Airbus A380 has raised questions concerning the speed at\nwhich they may be evacuated. The abnormal height of emergency exits on the\nupper deck has led to speculation that emotional factors such as fear may lead\nto door delay, and thus play a significant role in increasing overall\nevacuation time. Full-scale evacuation tests are financially expensive and\npotentially hazardous, and systematic studies of the evacuation of VLTA are\nrare. Here we present a computationally cheap agent-based framework for the\ngeneral simulation of aircraft evacuation, and apply it to the particular case\nof the Airbus A380. In particular, we investigate the effect of door delay, and\nconclude that even a moderate average delay can lead to evacuation times that\nexceed the maximum for safety certification. The model suggests practical ways\nto minimise evacuation time, as well as providing a general framework for the\nsimulation of evacuation.",

Persistence is a generalization to directed\ngraphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving\nautonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a\ndirected structure of unilateral distances constraints seeking to preserve a\nformation shape. Analogously to the powerful results about Henneberg sequences\nin minimal rigidity theory, we propose different types of directed graph\noperations allowing one to sequentially build any minimally persistent graph\n(i.e. persistent graph with a minimal number of edges for a given number of\nvertices), each intermediate graph being also minimally persistent. We also\nconsider the more generic problem of obtaining one minimally persistent graph\nfrom another, which corresponds to the on-line reorganization of an autonomous\nagent formation. We prove that we can obtain any minimally persistent formation\nfrom any other one by a sequence of elementary local operations such that\nminimal persistence is preserved throughout the reorganization process.",

When the agent is able to\ndetermine his position only from time to time, the graph is said to be\n\\emph{partly observable}. Observability in graphs is desirable in situations\nwhere autonomous agents are moving on a network and one wants to localize them\n(or the agent wants to localize himself) with limited information. In this\npaper, we completely characterize observable and partly observable graphs and\nshow how these concepts relate to observable discrete event systems and to\nlocal automata. Based on these characterizations, we provide polynomial time\nalgorithms to decide observability, to decide partial observability, and to\ncompute the minimal number of observations necessary for finding the position\nof an agent. In particular we prove that in the worst case this minimal number\nof observations increases quadratically with the number of nodes in the graph.\n  From this it follows that it may be necessary for an agent to pass through\nthe same node several times before he is finally able to determine his position\nin the graph. We then consider the more difficult question of assigning colors\nto a graph so as to make it observable and we prove that two different versions\nof this problem are NP-complete.",

Each committee of agents, which is\nregarded as a player in a game, is optimised by continually adapting the\narchitecture of the agents using genetic algorithms. The committees of agents\nbuy and sell stocks by following this procedure: (1) obtain the current price\nof stocks; (2) predict the future price of stocks; (3) and for a given price\ntrade until all the players are mutually satisfied. The trading of stocks is\nconducted by following these rules: (1) if a player expects an increase in\nprice then it tries to buy the stock; (2) else if it expects a drop in the\nprice, it sells the stock; (3)and the order in which a player participates in\nthe game is random. The proposed procedure is implemented to simulate trading\nof three stocks, namely, the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A linear\nrelationship between the number of players and agents versus the computational\ntime to run the complete simulation is observed.

    "summary": "A new approach of coordination of decisions in a multi site system is\nproposed. It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept and on the\nprinciple of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each\nenterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local\nand global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual\nEnterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of\ntiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner\nconstitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers.\nExchanges between the VENs ensure the autonomy of decision, and guarantiee the\nconsistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN\nagents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA)\nand one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If\nsupply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier\nNegotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain\nMediator Agent (SCMA) working at the level of the enterprise network. These two\nagents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs\nprocess the flow of information alone. With this new approach, managing\nenterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a\nsimple enterprise in the network. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows\nphysical distribution of the decisional system, and procures a heterarchical\norganization structure with a decentralized control that guaranties the\nautonomy of each entity and the flexibility of the network.",

Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives\nglobal objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The Mediator\nAgent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those\nobjectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to Negotiator\nAgent at the tier level (NAT).

    "summary": "A common assumption in modern microeconomic theory is that choice should be\nrationalizable via a binary preference relation, which \\citeauthor{Sen71a}\nshowed to be equivalent to two consistency conditions, namely $\\alpha$\n(contraction) and $\\gamma$ (expansion). Within the context of \\emph{social}\nchoice, however, rationalizability and similar notions of consistency have\nproved to be highly problematic, as witnessed by a range of impossibility\nresults, among which Arrow's is the most prominent. Since choice functions\nselect \\emph{sets} of alternatives rather than single alternatives, we propose\nto rationalize choice functions by preference relations over sets\n(set-rationalizability). We also introduce two consistency conditions,\n$\\hat\\alpha$ and $\\hat\\gamma$, which are defined in analogy to $\\alpha$ and\n$\\gamma$, and find that a choice function is set-rationalizable if and only if\nit satisfies $\\hat\\alpha$. Moreover, a choice function satisfies $\\hat\\alpha$\nand $\\hat\\gamma$ if and only if it is \\emph{self-stable}, a new concept based\non earlier work by \\citeauthor{Dutt88a}. The class of self-stable social choice\nfunctions contains a number of appealing Condorcet extensions such as the\nminimal covering set and the essential set.",

    "summary": "Multi-agent systems where the agents are developed by parties with competing\ninterests, and where there is no access to an agent's internal state, are often\nclassified as `open'. The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail\nto, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification.\nConsequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist\nbetween the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power.\nThe specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a\ndesign-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification\nmodification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is\noften required to revise the specification during the system execution. To\naddress this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'\nspecifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the\nagents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a\nmodification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and\nenactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule\nmodification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by\nconsidering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore,\nwe constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation\ncriteria. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications,\nand the `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications.\nWe illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a\nresource-sharing protocol.",

Our objective is to devise strategies\nfor scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking\nperformance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the control actions\ncorrespond to the set of sensors to activate at each time step. Using a\nbottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with\nincreasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the\ndifferent sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the\nsensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping\nsensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the\ndifferent sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein\nthe target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous\nspaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models\ndue to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we\ndevise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds\non the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit\nsuboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs.",

In this report I describe a way to combine the\nmulti-agent framework Jason, an extended version of the agent-oriented\nprogramming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By\nextending parts of the Jason reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to\ncomplete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able\nto avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a\nfunctional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego\nagents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the\nagents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required\nto move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning\ncycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and\ncan be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a\nmulti-agent environment.",

It\nconsiders contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and\ncritical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or\nnight) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node\nand sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to\nperform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context\ninterpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency\ncomprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB).\nContext agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node\nmanager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink\nnode by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager\nagent, fusing agent, and sink black board. A context at the sensor node\ntriggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager\nagent triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits\nactive sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to\nsink. The fusing agent uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is\nsimulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean\nsquare error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery\nusage and agent overhead.",

    "summary": "We study the problem of locating a particularly dangerous node, the so-called\nblack hole in a synchronous anonymous ring network with mobile agents. A black\nhole is a harmful stationary process residing in a node of the network and\ndestroying destroys all mobile agents visiting that node without leaving any\ntrace. We consider the more challenging scenario when the agents are identical\nand initially scattered within the network. Moreover, we solve the problem with\nagents that have constant-sized memory and carry a constant number of identical\ntokens, which can be placed at nodes of the network. In contrast, the only\nknown solutions for the case of scattered agents searching for a black hole,\nuse stronger models where the agents have non-constant memory, can write\nmessages in whiteboards located at nodes or are allowed to mark both the edges\nand nodes of the network with tokens. This paper solves the problem for ring\nnetworks containing a single black hole. We are interested in the minimum\nresources (number of agents and tokens) necessary for locating all links\nincident to the black hole. We present deterministic algorithms for ring\ntopologies and provide matching lower and upper bounds for the number of agents\nand the number of tokens required for deterministic solutions to the black hole\nsearch problem, in oriented or unoriented rings, using movable or unmovable\ntokens.",

    "summary": "Many current large-scale multiagent team implementations can be characterized\nas following the belief-desire-intention (BDI) paradigm, with explicit\nrepresentation of team plans. Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key\ncontribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for\nour BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results\nfrom two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster\nrescue simulation.",

    "publish": "2011-09-26T20:21:57Z", 
    "summary": "Effective coordination of agents actions in partially-observable domains is a\nmajor challenge of multi-agent systems research. To address this, many\nresearchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions\nbased on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically\nlearnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of\nthese approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary\ninformation is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end,\nwe argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is\none such mechanism. However, in a dynamically changing environment, the\naccuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity\nof the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on\nthese. Given this, we propose a novel information-sharing protocol,\npost-task-completion sharing, for the distribution of state information. We\nthen show, through a formal analysis, the improvement in the quality of\nestimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing\ninformation between nearest neighbours. Moreover, communication heuristics\ndesigned around our information-sharing principle are subjected to empirical\nevaluation along with other benchmark strategies (including Littmans Q-routing\nand Stones TPOT-RL) in a simulated call-routing application. These studies,\nconducted across a range of environmental settings, show that, compared to the\ndifferent benchmarks used, our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60%\nin the call connection rate; of more than 1000% in the ability to connect\nlong-distance calls; and incurs as low as 0.25 of the message overhead.",

Various\njointly-connected interaction topologies of the follower agents with\nuncertainties are considered in the study of set tracking. Based on the\nconnectivity of the time-varying multi-agent system, necessary and sufficient\nconditions are obtained for set input-to-state stability and set integral\ninput-to-state stability for a nonlinear neighbor-based coordination rule with\nswitching directed topologies. Conditions for asymptotic set tracking are also\nproposed with respect to the polytope spanned by the leaders.",

    "publish": "2011-12-06T16:35:28Z", 
    "summary": "This paper investigates the role persistent arcs play for a social network to\nreach a global belief agreement under discrete-time or continuous-time\nevolution. Each (directed) arc in the underlying communication graph is assumed\nto be associated with a time-dependent weight function which describes the\nstrength of the information flow from one node to another. An arc is said to be\npersistent if its weight function has infinite $\\mathscr{L}_1$ or $\\ell_1$ norm\nfor continuous-time or discrete-time belief evolutions, respectively. The graph\nthat consists of all persistent arcs is called the persistent graph of the\nunderlying network. Three necessary and sufficient conditions on agreement or\n$\\epsilon$-agreement are established, by which we prove that the persistent\ngraph fully determines the convergence to a common opinion in social networks.\nIt is shown how the convergence rates explicitly depend on the diameter of the\npersistent graph. The results adds to the understanding of the fundamentals\nbehind global agreements, as it is only persistent arcs that contribute to the\nconvergence.",

We propose a novel technique based on distributed belief aggregation\nusing a multi-agent prediction market to solve this information fusion problem.\nTo monitor the improvement in the confidence of the object classification as\nwell as to dis-incentivize agents from misreporting information, we have\nintroduced a market maker that rewards the agents instantaneously as well as at\nthe end of the inference task, based on the quality of the submitted reports.\nWe have implemented the market maker's reward calculation in the form of a\nscoring rule and have shown analytically that it incentivizes truthful\nrevelation or accurate reporting by each agent. We have experimentally verified\nour technique for multi-sensor information fusion for an automated landmine\ndetection scenario. Our experimental results show that, for identical data\ndistributions and settings, using our information aggregation technique\nincreases the accuracy of object classification favorably as compared to two\nother commonly used techniques for information fusion for landmine detection.",

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of \"ant robots\"\nfor covering a connected region on the $Z^{2}$ grid, whose area is unknown in\nadvance and which expands stochastically. Specifically, we discuss the problem\nwhere an initial connected region of $S_0$ boundary tiles expand outward with\nprobability $p$ at every time step. On this grid region a group of $k$ limited\nand simple agents operate, in order to clean the unmapped and dynamically\nexpanding region. A preliminary version of this problem was discussed in\n[1],[2] involving a deterministic expansion of a region in the grid.In this\nwork we extend the model and examine cases where the spread of the region is\ndone stochastically, where each tile has some probability $p$ to expand, at\nevery time step. For this extended model we obtain an analytic probabilistic\nlower bounds for the minimal number of agents and minimal time required to\nenable a collaborative coverage of the expanding region, regardless of the\nalgorithm used and the robots' hardware and software specifications.

    "summary": "Since the time when concept of e-maintenance was introduced, most of the\nworks insisted on the relevance of the underlying Information and Communication\nTechnologies infrastructure. Through a review of current e-maintenance\nconceptual approaches and realizations, this paper aims to reconsider the\npredominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature. The review\nbrings to light the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of\ne-maintenance that is to be led in a holistic predefined manner rather than\nisolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. As a contribution towards an\nintelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework, a proposal is outlined\nin this paper to model e-maintenance system as an intelligent system. The\nproposed frame is based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Within\nthe proposed frame, more importance was reserved to the environment that the\nsystem is to be continuously aware of: Plant Environment, Internal and External\nEnterprise Environment and Human Environment. In addition to the abilities\nrequired for internal coherent behavior of the system, requirements for\nmaintenance activities support are also mapped within the same frame according\nto corresponding levels of management. A case study was detailed in this paper\nsustaining the applicability of the proposal in relation to the classification\nof existing e-maintenance platforms. However, more work is needed to enhance\nexhaustiveness of the frame to serve as a comparison tool of existing\ne-maintenance systems. At the conceptual level, our future work is to use the\nproposed frame in an e-maintenance project.",

    "summary": "Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is\nimportant when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. Not only\nmicro-simulation and agent-based model such as UrbanSim, ILUMAS and SIMFIRMS,\nbut also Simon's model of hierarchical concentration have widely applied, for\nthis purpose. These models, however, have limitations with respect to\nsimulating structural changes in spatial economic systems and the impact of\nproximity. The present paper proposes a model of firm development that is based\non behavioural rules such as growth, closure, spin-off and relocation. An\nimportant aspect of the model is that locational preferences of firms are based\non agglomeration advantages, accessibility of markets and congestion, allowing\nfor a proper description of concentration and deconcentration tendencies. By\ncomparing the outcomes of the proposed model with real world data, we will\ncalibrate the parameters and assess how well the model predicts existing\nspatial configurations and decide. The model is implemented as an agent-based\nsimulation model describing firm development in the Netherlands in 21\nindustrial sectors from 1950 to 2004.",

Their importance is considerable when it comes to\nguarantee safety and protection during a crisis.

This\npaper presents a serious game developed using Unity3D to recreate a virtual\nfire evacuation training tool. The prototype application was deployed which\nallowed the validation by user testing. A sample of 30 individuals tested the\nevacuating scenario, having to leave the building during a fire in the shortest\ntime possible.

This\nconvexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that\nthe vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting\nhyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of\nrequiring shared reference directions in addition to the available local\nrelative states. Such shared reference directions can be further interpreted as\nif each agent holds a magnetic compass indicating the orientations of a global\nframe. It is proven that the cooperative multi-agent system achieves\nexponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying interaction graph\nis uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected. Cooperative--antagonistic\nmulti-agent systems are also considered. For these systems, the relation has a\nnegative sign for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State\nagreement may not be achieved, but instead it is shown that all the agents'\nstates asymptotically converge, and their limits agree componentwise in\nabsolute values if and in general only if the time-varying interaction graph is\nuniformly jointly strongly connected.",

    "publish": "2013-08-25T06:28:32Z", 
    "summary": "Pedestrian behavior has much more complicated characteristics in a dense\ncrowd and thus attracts the widespread interest of scientists and engineers.\nHowever, even successful modeling approaches such as pedestrian models based on\nparticle systems are still not fully considered the perceptive mechanism\nunderlying collective pedestrian behavior. This paper extends a behavioral\nheuristics-based pedestrian model to an adaptive agent-based model, which\nexplicitly considers the crowding effect of neighboring individuals and\nperception anisotropy on the representation of a pedestrians visual\ninformation. The adaptive agents with crowding perception are constructed to\ninvestigate complex, selforganized collective dynamics of pedestrian motion.\nThe proposed model simulates selforganized pedestrian flows in good\nquantitative agreement with empirical data. The selforganized phenomena include\nlane formation in bidirectional flow and fundamental diagrams of unidirectional\nflow. Simulation results show that the emergence of lane formation in\nbidirectional flow can be well reproduced. To investigate this further,\nincreasing view distance has a significant effect on reducing the number of\nlanes, increasing lane width, and stabilizing the self-organized lanes. The\npaper also discusses phase transitions of fundamental diagrams of pedestrian\ncrowds with unidirectional flow. It is found that the heterogeneity of how\npedestrians perceive crowding in the population has a remarkable impact on the\nflow quality, which results in the buildup of congestion and rapidly decreases\nthe efficiency of pedestrian flows. It also indicates that the concept of\nheterogeneity may be used to explain the instability of phase transitions.",

This paper describes the\nFuzzy Decision Analysis used in the negotiation between the SoS agent and a\nSystem agent in the ABM of an Acknowledged SoS development. An Acknowledged SoS\nhas by definition a limited influence on the development of the individual\nSystems. The individual Systems have their own priorities, pressures, and\nagenda which may or may not align with the goals of the SoS. The SoS has some\nfunding and deadlines which can be used to negotiate with the individual System\nin order to illicit the required capability from that System. The Fuzzy\nDecision Analysis determines how the SoS agent will adjust the funding and\ndeadlines for each of the Systems in order to achieve the desired SoS\narchitecture quality. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis has inputs of performance,\nfunding, and deadlines as well as weights for each capability. The performance,\nfunding, and deadlines are crisp values which are fuzzified. The fuzzified\nvalues are then used with a Fuzzy Inference Engine to get the fuzzy outputs of\nfunding adjustment and deadline adjustment which must then be defuzzified\nbefore being passed to the System agent.

Few applied urban\nmodels can pursue large-scale extent with fine-level units simultaneously due\nto data availability and computation load.

In this study, a mega-vector-parcels cellular automata model\n(MVP-CA) is developed for simulating urban expansion in the parcel level for\nall 654 Chinese cities.

In\ncontrast with current negotiation models, this form of negotiation allows the\nagents to dynamically extend the set of items under negotiation.

This prediction is achieved by employing\nan Artificial Neural Network combined with a Self-Organising Map that detects\nand matches changes in the environment.

Observer\ninterpretations are essential to the way we understand these relationships.\nHence observer semantics are an integral part of what we mean by spacetime.\n  Semantics make up the essential difference in how one describes and uses the\nconcept of space in physics, chemistry, biology and technology. In these notes,\nI have tried to assemble what seems to be a set of natural, and pragmatic,\nconsiderations about discrete, finite spacetimes, to unify descriptions of\nthese areas.\n  It reviews familiar notions of spacetime, and brings them together into a\nless familiar framework of promise theory (autonomous agents), in order to\nilluminate the goal of encoding the semantics of observers into a description\nof spacetime itself. Autonomous agents provide an exacting atomic and local\nmodel for finite spacetime, which quickly reveals the issues of incomplete\ninformation and non-locality. From this we should be able to reconstruct all\nother notions of spacetime.\n  The aim of this exercise is to apply related tools and ideas to an initial\nunification of real and artificial spaces, e.g. databases and information webs\nwith natural spacetime. By reconstructing these spaces from autonomous agents,\nwe may better understand naming and coordinatization of semantic spaces, from\ncrowds and swarms to datacentres and libraries, as well as the fundamental\narena of natural science.",

    "publish": "2014-11-23T07:03:07Z", 
    "summary": "It has been widely recognized that the performance of a multi-agent system is\nhighly affected by its organization. A large scale system may have billions of\npossible ways of organization, which makes it impractical to find an optimal\nchoice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this paper, we\npropose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing\nhierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm,\ncalled the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with\na repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic\nhierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array\nrepresentation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operator-literate. A\ncase study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is\nprovided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which\nlead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the\nproposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. Compared with the\ntraditional genetic operators, the newly introduced operators produced better\norganizations of higher utility more consistently in a variety of test cases.\nThe proposed algorithm extends of the search processes of the state-of-the-art\nmulti-agent organization design methodologies, and is more computationally\nefficient in a large search space.",

While Schelling's explicit\nconcern was to understand the mechanisms underlying racial segregation in large\ncities from a game theoretic perspective, the model should be seen as one of a\nfamily, arising in fields as diverse as statistical mechanics, neural networks\nand the social sciences, and which are concerned with interacting populations\nsituated on network structures.

The separation and\nencapsulation of the activities that are conceptually related to the\ncoordination, is a crucial concern for systematic development practices in\norder to prepare the reuse and systematic integration of coordination processes\nin software systems.

One fundamental design concern for a corresponding execution\nmiddleware is the minimal-invasive augmentation of the activities that affect\ncoordination. This design challenge is approached by the activation of agent\nmodules. Modules are converted to software elements that reason about and\nmodify their host agent.

    "summary": "This paper asks a new question: how can we control the collective behavior of\nself-organized multi-agent systems? We try to answer the question by proposing\na new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing\nagents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.\nConsider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by\nVicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but\nwith different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the\naverage of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of\nthis model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as\nsynchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior\n(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special\nagent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an\nordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so\nthat it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control\nlaw is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft\ncontrol is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural\nway to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting\nissues and challenges on the control of complex systems.",

The major advantages of RGT are its ability to predict human\nbehavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind.

    "publish": "2012-10-16T12:26:33Z", 
    "summary": "Consensus strategies find a variety of applications in distributed\ncoordination and decision making in multi-agent systems. In particular, average\nconsensus plays a key role in a number of applications and is closely\nassociated with two classes of digraphs, weight-balanced (for continuous-time\nsystems) and bistochastic (for discrete-time systems). A weighted digraph is\ncalled balanced if, for each node, the sum of the weights of the edges outgoing\nfrom that node is equal to the sum of the weights of the edges incoming to that\nnode. In addition, a weight-balanced digraph is bistochastic if all weights are\nnonnegative and, for each node, the sum of weights of edges incoming to that\nnode and the sum of the weights of edges out-going from that node is unity;\nthis implies that the corresponding weight matrix is column and row stochastic\n(i.e., doubly stochastic). We propose two distributed algorithms: one solves\nthe weight-balance problem and the other solves the bistochastic matrix\nformation problem for a distributed system whose components (nodes) can\nexchange information via interconnection links (edges) that form an arbitrary,\npossibly directed, strongly connected communication topology (digraph). Both\ndistributed algorithms achieve their goals asymptotically and operate\niteratively by having each node adapt the (nonnegative) weights on its outgoing\nedges based on the weights of its incoming links (i.e., based on purely local\ninformation). We also provide examples to illustrate the operation,\nperformance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithms.",

    "summary": "We consider a smart grid with an independent system operator (ISO), and\ndistributed aggregators who have energy storage and purchase energy from the\nISO to serve its customers. All the entities in the system are foresighted:\neach aggregator seeks to minimize its own long-term payments for energy\npurchase and operational costs of energy storage by deciding how much energy to\nbuy from the ISO, and the ISO seeks to minimize the long-term total cost of the\nsystem (e.g. energy generation costs and the aggregators' costs) by dispatching\nthe energy production among the generators. The decision making of the entities\nis complicated for two reasons. First, the information is decentralized: the\nISO does not know the aggregators' states (i.e. their energy consumption\nrequests from customers and the amount of energy in their storage), and each\naggregator does not know the other aggregators' states or the ISO's state (i.e.\nthe energy generation costs and the status of the transmission lines). Second,\nthe coupling among the aggregators is unknown to them. Specifically, each\naggregator's energy purchase affects the price, and hence the payments of the\nother aggregators. However, none of them knows how its decision influences the\nprice because the price is determined by the ISO based on its state. We propose\na design framework in which the ISO provides each aggregator with a conjectured\nfuture price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-term\ncost based on its conjectured price as well as its local information. The\nproposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralized\nand involving complex coupling among the various entities.",

    "summary": "We analyse the computational complexity of three problems in judgment\naggregation: (1) computing a collective judgment from a profile of individual\njudgments (the winner determination problem); (2) deciding whether a given\nagent can influence the outcome of a judgment aggregation procedure in her\nfavour by reporting insincere judgments (the strategic manipulation problem);\nand (3) deciding whether a given judgment aggregation scenario is guaranteed to\nresult in a logically consistent outcome, independently from what the judgments\nsupplied by the individuals are (the problem of the safety of the agenda). We\nprovide results both for specific aggregation procedures (the quota rules, the\npremise-based procedure, and a distance-based procedure) and for classes of\naggregation procedures characterised in terms of fundamental axioms.",

    "publish": "2014-01-27T09:27:50Z", 
    "summary": "A flow of moving agents can be observed at different scales. Thus, in traffic\nmodeling, three levels are generally considered: the micro, meso and macro\nlevels, representing respectively the interactions between vehicles, groups of\nvehicles sharing common properties (such as a common destination or a common\nlocalization) and flows of vehicles. Each approach is useful in a given\ncontext: micro and meso models allow to simulate road networks with complex\ntopologies such as urban area, while macro models allow to develop control\nstrategies to prevent congestion in highways. However, to simulate large-scale\nroad networks, it can be interesting to integrate different representations,\ne.g., micro and macro, in a single model. Existing models share the same\nlimitation: connections between levels are fixed a priori and cannot be changed\nat runtime. Therefore, to be able to observe some emerging phenomena such as\ncongestion formation or to find the exact location of a jam in a large macro\nsection, a dynamic hybrid modeling approach is needed. In 2013 we started the\ndevelopment of a multi-level agent-based simulator called JAM-FREE within the\nISART project. It allows to simulate large road networks efficiently using a\ndynamic level of detail. This simulator relies on a multi-level agent-based\nmodeling framework called SIMILAR.",

    "summary": "Discrete pedestrian simulation models are viable alternatives to particle\nbased approaches based on a continuous spatial representation. The effects of\ndiscretisation, however, also imply some difficulties in modelling certain\nphenomena that can be observed in reality. This paper focuses on the\npossibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated\npopulation of pedestrians by modifying an existing multi-agent model extending\nthe floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or\ncars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per\ntime step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but\nwe model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some\nturns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired\nwalking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain\nan average speed close to this threshold. In the paper we formally describe the\nmodel and we show the results of its application in benchmark scenarios.\nFinally, we also show how this approach can also support the definition of\nslopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians\nclimbing them in a simulated scenario.",

Sugarscape is one of the\nmost famous examples of a social agent-based model which has been used to show\nhow societies grow in the real world.\n  This paper builds on the Sugarscape model, using the Flexible Large scale\nAgent-based modelling Environment (FLAME) to simulate three different scenarios\nof the experiment, which are based on the Sugar and Citizen locations. FLAME is\nan agent-based modelling framework which has previously been used to model\nbiological and economic models. The paper includes details on how the model was\nwritten and the various parameters set for the simulation. The results of the\nmodel simulated are processed for three scenarios and analysed to see what\naffect the initial starting states of the agents had on the overall result\nobtained through the model and the variance in simulation time of processing\nthe model on multicore architectures.\n  The experiments highlight that there are limitations of the FLAME framework\nand writing simulation models in general which are highly dependent on initial\nstarting states of a model, also raising further potential work which can be\nbuilt into the Sugarscape model to study other interesting phenomenon in social\nand economic laws.",

    "summary": "Intelligent Agents act in open and thus risky environments, hence making the\nappropriate decision about who to trust in order to interact with, could be a\nchallenging process. As intelligent agents are gradually enriched with Semantic\nWeb technology, acting on behalf of their users with limited or no human\nintervention, their ability to perform assigned tasks is scrutinized. Hence,\ntrust and reputation models, based on interaction trust or witness reputation,\nhave been proposed, yet they often presuppose the use of a centralized\nauthority. Although such mechanisms are more popular, they are usually faced\nwith skepticism, since users may question the trustworthiness and the\nrobustness of a central authority. Distributed models, on the other hand, are\nmore complex but they provide personalized estimations based on each agent's\ninterests and preferences. To this end, this article proposes DISARM, a novel\ndistributed reputation model. DISARM deals MASs as social networks, enabling\nagents to establish and maintain relationships, limiting the disadvantages of\nthe common distributed approaches. Additionally, it is based on defeasible\nlogic, modeling the way intelligent agents, like humans, draw reasonable\nconclusions from incomplete and possibly conflicting (thus inconclusive)\ninformation. Finally, we provide an evaluation that illustrates the usability\nof the proposed model.",

    "summary": "We examine the behavior of multi-agent networks where information-sharing is\nsubject to a positive communications cost over the edges linking the agents. We\nconsider a general mean-square-error formulation where all agents are\ninterested in estimating the same target vector. We first show that, in the\nabsence of any incentives to cooperate, the optimal strategy for the agents is\nto behave in a selfish manner with each agent seeking the optimal solution\nindependently of the other agents. Pareto inefficiency arises as a result of\nthe fact that agents are not using historical data to predict the behavior of\ntheir neighbors and to know whether they will reciprocate and participate in\nsharing information. Motivated by this observation, we develop a reputation\nprotocol to summarize the opponent's past actions into a reputation score,\nwhich can then be used to form a belief about the opponent's subsequent\nactions. The reputation protocol entices agents to cooperate and turns their\noptimal strategy into an action-choosing strategy that enhances the overall\nsocial benefit of the network. In particular, we show that when the\ncommunications cost becomes large, the expected social benefit of the proposed\nprotocol outperforms the social benefit that is obtained by cooperative agents\nthat always share data. We perform a detailed mean-square-error analysis of the\nevolution of the network over three domains: far field, near-field, and\nmiddle-field, and show that the network behavior is stable for sufficiently\nsmall step-sizes. The various theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nsimulations.",

The goal is to ensure that\n$p$ wins by shifting $p$ higher in some voters' preference orders. However,\neach such shift request comes at a price (depending on the voter and on the\nextent of the shift) and we must not exceed the given budget. We study the\nparameterized computational complexity of Shift Bribery with respect to a\nnumber of parameters (pertaining to the nature of the solution sought and the\nsize of the election) and several classes of price functions. When we\nparameterize Shift Bribery by the number of affected voters, then for each of\nour voting rules (Borda, Maximin, Copeland) the problem is W[2]-hard. If,\ninstead, we parameterize by the number of positions by which $p$ is shifted in\ntotal,then the problem is fixed-parameter tractable for Borda and Maximin,and\nis W[1]-hard for Copeland. If we parameterize by the budget, then the results\ndepend on the price function class.

    "summary": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are ubiquitous in research and industry. Currently,\nsimulating ABMs involves at least some imperative (step-by-step) computer\ninstructions. An alternative approach is declarative programming, in which a\nset of requirements is described at a high level of abstraction. Here we\ndescribe a fully declarative approach to the automated construction of\nsimulations for ABMs. In this framework, logic for ABM simulations is\nencapsulated into predefined components. The user specifies a set of\nrequirements describing the desired functionality. Additionally, each component\nhas a set of consistency requirements. The framework iteratively seeks a\nsimulation design that satisfies both user and system requirements. This\napproach allows the user to omit most details from the simulation\nspecification, simplifying simulation design.",

    "publish": "2015-03-31T14:39:27Z", 
    "summary": "Reputation is generally defined as the opinion of a group on an aspect of a\nthing. This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic\nmodelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion\ndecays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the\nreliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its\nweight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with\nits opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can\nbe extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse.\nWe illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral\ninformation in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of\nthe uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior. We take up the challenge\nof predicting the behavior of football teams in football matches, which we\nargue is a very interesting yet difficult approach for evaluating the model.",

    "publish": "2015-05-05T11:15:43Z", 
    "summary": "In a previous study, we considered an information-theoretic model of code\nevolution. In it, agents obtain information about their (common) environment by\nthe perception of messages of other agents, which is determined by an\ninteraction probability (the structure of the population). For an agent to\nunderstand another agent's messages, the former must either know the identity\nof the latter, or the code producing the messages must be universally\ninterpretable. A universal code, however, introduces a vulnerability: a\nparasitic entity can take advantage of it. Here, we investigate this problem.\nIn our specific setting, we consider a parasite to be an agent that tries to\ninflict as much damage as possible in the mutual understanding of the\npopulation (i.e. the parasite acts as a disinformation agent). We show that,\nafter introducing a parasite in the population, the former adopts a code such\nthat it captures the information about the environment that is missing in the\npopulation. Such agent would be of great value, but only if the rest of the\npopulation could understand its messages. However, it is of little use here,\nsince the parasite utilises the most common messages in the population to\nexpress different concepts. Now we let the population respond by updating their\ncodes such that, in this arms race, they again maximise their mutual\nunderstanding. As a result, there is a code drift in the population where the\nutilisation of the messages of the parasite is avoided. A consequence of this\nis that the information that the parasite possesses but the agents lack becomes\nunderstandable and readily available.",

The agents try to maximise their information about their\nenvironment by acquiring information from the outputs of other agents in the\npopulation. A naive use of information-theoretic methods would assume that\nevery agent knows how to \"interpret\" the information offered by other agents.\nHowever, this assumes that one \"knows\" which other agents one observes, and\nthus which code they use. In our model, however, we wish to preclude that: it\nis not clear which other agents an agent is observing, and the resulting usable\ninformation is therefore influenced by the universality of the code used and by\nwhich agents an agent is \"listening\" to. We further investigate whether an\nagent who does not directly perceive the environment can distinguish states by\nobserving other agents' outputs. For this purpose, we consider a population of\ndifferent types of agents \"talking\" about different concepts, and try to\nextract new ones by considering their outputs only.",

    "summary": "The increased complexity and dynamism of present and future Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) enforce the need for considering both of their static\n(design-time) and the dynamic (run-time) aspects. A type of balance between the\ntwo aspects can definitely give better results related to system stability and\nadaptivity. MAS organization is the research area that is concerned with these\nissues and it is currently a very active and interesting research area.\nDesigning a MAS with an initial organization and giving it the ability to\ndynamically reorganize to adapt the dynamic changes of its unpredictable and\nuncertain environment, is the feasible way to survive and to run effectively.\nNormally, MAS organization is tackled by what is called, MAS organizational\nmodels, which are concerned with the description (formally or informally) of\nthe structural and dynamical aspects of agent organizations. This paper\nproposes a two-dimension space, called MOS-2, for positioning and assessing MAS\norganizational models based on two dimensions: their adopted engineering\nviewpoint (agent-centered or organization-centered) as the vertical dimension\nand the agents awareness/unawareness of the existence of the organizational\nlevel as the horizontal dimension. The MOS-2 space is applied for positioning a\nnumber of familiar organizational models. Its future trends and possible\nimprovements are highlighted.

    "summary": "Agent based distributed manufacturing control and scheduling systems are\nsubsets of new manufacturing systems. Multi agent systems (MAS) not only drive\ndesign and engineering control solutions but also influence flexibility,\nagility, and re-configurability, which makes MASs a better centralized systems\nthan its traditional counterparts. However, implementation of all MASs in the\nreal factories are timely, also extremely costly. A simulation environment that\nwould allow independent development and testing of the services and business\nprocesses of the related manufacturing hardware is needed. This paper presents\nthe design and implementation of a userfriendly simulation platform for multi\nagent based manufacturing control systems by considering the shop floor level.\nThe proposed simulation platform can simulate the software level of the factory\nby considering the hardware level of the mentioned factory. An example of the\nsimulation platform is presented for a flexible manufacturing system, which is\nlocated in EMU CIM lab.",

The main contribution of the new approach is the\nalgorithm presented in as a flow chart where the condition to stop the process\nmight be either a threshold value for the consistency index, or a given number\nof iterations for the group or decision maker, depending on the degree to which\nthe targeted goal has been decomposed into conflictual objectives.",

    "publish": "2016-07-12T10:57:30Z", 
    "summary": "Reaching some form of consensus is often necessary for autonomous agents that\nwant to coordinate their actions or otherwise engage in joint activities. One\nway to reach a consensus is by aggregating individual information, such as\ndecisions, beliefs, preferences and constraints. Judgment aggregation is a\nsocial choice method, which generalises voting, that studies the aggregation of\nindividual judgments regarding the truth-value of logically related\npropositions. As such, judgment aggregation is applicable for consensus\nreaching problems in multi agent systems. As other social choice theory,\njudgment aggregation research is abundant with impossibility results. However,\nthe aim of this tutorial is to give an introduction to the methods of judgment\naggregation, not the impossibility results. In particular, the tutorial will\nintroduce the basic frameworks that model judgment aggregation problems and\ngive an overview of the judgment aggregation functions so far developed as well\nas their social theoretic and computational complexity properties. The focus of\nthe tutorial are consensus reaching problems in multi agent systems that can be\nmodelled as judgment aggregation problems. The desirable properties of a\njudgment aggregation method applied to these problems are not necessarily the\nsame as properties desirable in legal or political contexts, which is\nconsidered to be the native domain of judgment aggregation. After this tutorial\nthe participants are expected to be able to read and understand judgment\naggregation literature and have a grasp on the state-of-the-art and open\nquestions in judgment aggregation research of interest to multi agent systems.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the issues concerning the rescheduling of a static\ntimetable in case of a disaster encountered in a large and complex railway\nnetwork system. The proposed approach tries to modify the schedule so as to\nminimise the overall delay of trains. This is achieved by representing the\nrescheduling problem in the form of a Petri-Net and the highly uncertain\ndisaster recovery times in such a model is handled as Markov Decision Processes\n(MDP ). For solving the rescheduling problem, a istributed Constraint\nOptimisation (DCOP ) based strategy involving the use of autonomous agents is\nused to generate the desired schedule. The proposed approach is evaluated on\nthe actual schedule of the Eastern Railways, India by constructing vari- ous\ndisaster scenarios using the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE). When\ncompared to the existing approaches, the proposed framework substantially\nreduces the delay of trains after rescheduling.",

The agent decision\nreflects its desire of maximizing the delivered power based on its internal\nstate, its global state perception, a randomized selfishness related to its\nwillingness to follow demand-side control requests, and the state information\nreceived from its neighbors in the communication network. Our focus is to\nunderstand how the network topology and errors in the communication layer\naffect the agents' behavior, reflected in the power utilization and fairness\nfor different demand-side policies. Our results show that for optimal power\nutilization and fairness a global knowledge about the system is needed.

    "publish": "2016-08-16T08:07:41Z", 
    "summary": "A team of identical and oblivious ant-like agents - a(ge)nts - leaving\npheromone traces, are programmed to jointly patrol an area modeled as a graph.\nThey perform this task using simple local interactions, while also achieving\nthe important byproduct of partitioning the graph into roughly equal-sized\ndisjoint sub-graphs. Each a(ge)nt begins to operate at an arbitrary initial\nlocation, and throughout its work does not acquire any information on either\nthe shape or size of the graph, or the number or whereabouts of other a(ge)nts.\nGraph partitioning occurs spontaneously, as each of the a(ge)nts patrols and\nexpands its own pheromone-marked sub-graph, or region. This graph partitioning\nalgorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic\nballoons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region\nmore frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent\nvertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding\nits region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a\nregion ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely\nproportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller\nregion will effectively exert higher \"pressure\" at its borders, and conquer\nadjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region\nand shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes\nof the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical\nballoons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.\nThe pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to\nevolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the\ngraph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the\nsystem settles into a stable and balanced partition.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces a demand-side distributed and secured energy commitment\nframework and operations for a Power Producer and Supplier (PPS) in deregulated\nenvironment. Due to the diversity of geographical location as well as\ncustomers' energy profile coupled with high number of customers, managing\nenergy transactions and resulting energy exchanges are challenging for a PPS.\nThe envisioned PPS maintains several aggregators (e.g. Microgrids), named as\nSub Service Provider (SSP) that manage customers/subscribers under their\ndomains. The SSPs act as agents that perform local energy matching (inside\ntheir domains) and distributed energy matching within SSPs to determine the\nenergy commitment. The goal of the distributed energy matching is to reduce the\ninvolvement of External Energy Supplier (e.g. Utility) while providing a\nplatform to demand side players to be a part of energy transaction. A\ndistributed assignment problem is designed that requires minimum and aggregated\ninformation exchange (hence, secured) and solved by Linear Programming (LP)\nthat provides the distributed matching decision. The communicative burden among\nSSPs due to the exchange of energy information is reduced by applying an\nadaptive coalition formation method. The simulations are conducted by\nimplementing a synchronous distributed matching algorithm while showing the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "publish": "2016-09-26T04:49:41Z", 
    "summary": "Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be\nchallenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's\nintent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time\nefficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring\nagents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work\npresents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a\nnovel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads\nthe online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline\nlearning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value\nnetwork that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint\nconfiguration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value\nnetwork not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for\nfinding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in\nthe other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26 percent\nimprovement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with\noptimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision\navoidance strategy.",

    "summary": "Autonomous Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems can utilize fleet management\nstrategies to properly position vehicles and allocate customers in order to\nmaintain a high customer quality of service (QoS). Previous works on autonomous\nMOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing single capacity vehicles,\nwhere QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing. This work focuses on MOD\nsystems utilizing a small number of vehicles, such as those found on a campus,\nwhere additional vehicles cannot be introduced as demand for rides increases. A\npredictive positioning method is presented for improving customer QoS in\nsmall-fleet MOD systems by identifying key locations which minimize expected\ncustomer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a means for improving customer\nQoS as arrival rates increase. However, with ridesharing perceived QoS is\ndependent on an often unknown customer preference. To address this challenge, a\ncustomer ratings model, which learns customer preference from a 5-star rating,\nis developed and incorporated directly into a ridesharing algorithm. The\npredictive positioning and ridesharing methods are applied to simulation of a\nreal-world campus MOD system. A combined predictive positioning and ridesharing\napproach is shown to reduce customer service times by up to 29%. and the\ncustomer ratings model is shown to provide the best overall MOD fleet\nmanagement performance over a range of customer preferences.",

The paper presents the results of a set of controlled experiments\n(with human volunteers) designed and performed to understand pedestrian's route\nchoice.

Results show that the length of paths and level\nof congestion influence decisions (negative feedback), as well as imitative\nbehaviour of \"emergent leaders\" choosing a new path (positive feedback). A\nnovel here illustrated model for the simulation of pedestrian route choice\ncaptures such evidences, encompassing both the tendency to avoid congestion and\nto follow emerging leaders. The found conflicting tendencies are modelled with\nthe introduction of a utility function allowing a consistent calibration over\nthe achieved results.

    "summary": "Published during a severe economic crisis, this study presents the first\nspatial microsimulation model for the analysis of income inequalities and\npoverty in Greece. First, we present a brief overview of the method and discuss\nits potential for the analysis of multidimensional poverty and income\ninequality in Greece. We then present the SimAthens model, based on a\ncombination of small-area demographic and socioeconomic information available\nfrom the Greek census of population with data from the European Union\nStatistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The model is based on an\niterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm, and is used to reweigh EU-SILC\nrecords to fit in small-area descriptions for Athens based on 2001 and 2011\ncensuses. This is achieved by using demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics as constraint variables. Finally, synthesis of the labor market\nand occupations are chosen as the main variables for externally validating our\nresults, in order to verify the integrity of the model. Results of this\nexternal validation process are found to be extremely satisfactory, indicating\na high goodness of fit between simulated and real values. Finally, the study\npresents a number of model outputs, illustrating changes in social and economic\ngeography, during a severe economic crisis, offering a great opportunity for\ndiscussing further potential of this model in policy analysis.",

    "publish": "2016-11-25T07:03:21Z", 
    "summary": "Provably safe and scalable multi-vehicle path planning is an important and\nurgent problem due to the expected increase of automation in civilian airspace\nin the near future. Although this problem has been studied in the past, there\nhas not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for\nvehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances\nand potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and\nsafety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many\nsmall-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most\ncases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the\nexponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system\ndimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability\nprovides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority\nordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path\nplanning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve \"space-time\" portions in the airspace,\nand the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,\nand optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation\ncomplexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and\nan intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can\ntractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with\ngeneral nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting. We demonstrate our theory in\nrepresentative simulations.",

    "summary": "Advancement in intelligent transportation systems with complex operations\nrequires autonomous planning and management to avoid collisions in day-to-day\ntraffic.

In this paper, we address different\ntypes of collision scenarios along with their early detection and resolution\ntechniques in a complex railway system. In order to handle collisions\ndynamically in distributed manner, a novel agent based solution approach is\nproposed using the idea of max-sum algorithm, where each agent (train agent,\nstation agent, and junction agent) communicates and cooperates with others to\ngenerate a good feasible solution that keeps the system in a safe state, i.e.,\ncollision free. We implement the proposed mechanism in Java Agent DEvelopment\nFramework (JADE).

    "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) is able to characterize the behavior of individual\nagent and the interaction between agents. Thus, it motivates us to leverage the\ndistributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling\nMAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).\nTwo issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet\nincluding: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the\nnegtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which\nkind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the\nquality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with\nan ECAV-$\\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\\eta$\nwith an adequate assignment ($\\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the\nscale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed\non the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the\nsolution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the\nMax-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method\n(LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to\ntransform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition, it is also\napparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the\nnumber of users increases but the available resource at base stations are\nlimited.",

The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win\n(\\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\\emph{destructive} control) the\nelection. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems\nwhenadding and deleting voters have a \\emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add\n(resp.\\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\\ delete) a bundle~$\\kappa(v) $\nof voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\\kappa(v)$ may have\nmore than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.\nWe analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for\nthe Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is\ncomputationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling\nrelation is symmetric (i.e.\\ $\\forall w\\colon w \\in \\kappa(v) \\Leftrightarrow v\n\\in \\kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,\nthen destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive\nvariant remains $\\NP$-hard.

    "summary": "Affect Control Theory (ACT) is a powerful and general sociological model of\nhuman affective interaction. ACT provides an empirically derived mathematical\nmodel of culturally shared sentiments as heuristic guides for human decision\nmaking. BayesACT, a variant on classical ACT, combines affective reasoning with\ncognitive (denotative or logical) reasoning as is traditionally found in AI.\nBayes\\-ACT allows for the creation of agents that are both emotionally guided\nand goal-directed. In this work, we simulate BayesACT agents in the Iterated\nNetworked Prisoner's Dilemma (INPD), and we show four out of five known\nproperties of human play in INPD are replicated by these socio-affective\nagents. In particular, we show how the observed human behaviours of network\nstructure invariance, anti-correlation of cooperation and reward, and player\ntype stratification are all clearly emergent properties of the networked\nBayesACT agents. We further show that decision hyteresis (Moody Conditional\nCooperation) is replicated by BayesACT agents in over $2/3$ of the cases we\nhave considered.

The individual decisions are based on different local\ninformation generated by the agents with a finite lifetime and disseminated in\nthe system with a finite velocity. We derive critical parameters for the\nemergence of minorities and majorities of agents making opposite decisions and\ninvestigate their spatial organization. We find that dependent on two essential\nparameters describing the local impact and the spatial dissemination of\ninformation, either a definite stable minority/majority relation\n(single-attractor regime) or a broad range of possible values (multi-attractor\nregime) occurs. In the latter case, the outcome of the decision process becomes\nrather diverse and hard to predict, both with respect to the share of the\nmajority and their spatial distribution. We further investigate how a\ndissemination of information on different time scales affects the outcome of\nthe decision process.

If additional time\nremains, our anytime algorithm searches further, and establishes a\nprogressively lower tight bound. Surprisingly, just searching one more node\ndrops the bound in half.

    "publish": "2000-12-11T10:17:36Z", 
    "summary": "With the increase in agent-based applications, there are now agent systems\nthat support \\emph{concurrent} client accesses. The ability to process large\nvolumes of simultaneous requests is critical in many such applications. In such\na setting, the traditional approach of serving these requests one at a time via\nqueues (e.g. \\textsf{FIFO} queues, priority queues) is insufficient.\nAlternative models are essential to improve the performance of such\n\\emph{heavily loaded} agents. In this paper, we propose a set of\n\\emph{cost-based algorithms} to \\emph{optimize} and \\emph{merge} multiple\nrequests submitted to an agent. In order to merge a set of requests, one first\nneeds to identify commonalities among such requests. First, we provide an\n\\emph{application independent framework} within which an agent developer may\nspecify relationships (called \\emph{invariants}) between requests. Second, we\nprovide two algorithms (and various accompanying heuristics) which allow an\nagent to automatically rewrite requests so as to avoid redundant work---these\nalgorithms take invariants associated with the agent into account. Our\nalgorithms are independent of any specific agent framework. For an\nimplementation, we implemented both these algorithms on top of the \\impact\nagent development platform, and on top of a (non-\\impact) geographic database\nagent. Based on these implementations, we conducted experiments and show that\nour algorithms are considerably more efficient than methods that use the $A^*$\nalgorithm.",

    "summary": "The search for information on the web is faced with several problems, which\narise on the one hand from the vast number of available sources, and on the\nother hand from their heterogeneity. A promising approach is the use of\nmulti-agent systems of information agents, which cooperatively solve advanced\ninformation-retrieval problems. This requires capabilities to address complex\ntasks, such as search and assessment of sources, query planning, information\nmerging and fusion, dealing with incomplete information, and handling of\ninconsistency. In this paper, our interest is in the role which some methods\nfrom the field of declarative logic programming can play in the realization of\nreasoning capabilities for information agents. In particular, we are interested\nin how they can be used and further developed for the specific needs of this\napplication domain. We review some existing systems and current projects, which\naddress information-integration problems.

    "summary": "Combinatorial auctions where agents can bid on bundles of items are desirable\nbecause they allow the agents to express complementarity and substitutability\nbetween the items. However, expressing one's preferences can require bidding on\nall bundles. Selective incremental preference elicitation by the auctioneer was\nrecently proposed to address this problem (Conen & Sandholm 2001), but the idea\nwas not evaluated. In this paper we show, experimentally and theoretically,\nthat automated elicitation provides a drastic benefit. In all of the\nelicitation schemes under study, as the number of items for sale increases, the\namount of information elicited is a vanishing fraction of the information\ncollected in traditional ``direct revelation mechanisms'' where bidders reveal\nall their valuation information. Most of the elicitation schemes also maintain\nthe benefit as the number of agents increases. We develop more effective\nelicitation policies for existing query types. We also present a new query type\nthat takes the incremental nature of elicitation to a new level by allowing\nagents to give approximate answers that are refined only on an as-needed basis.\nIn the process, we present methods for evaluating different types of\nelicitation policies.",

    "summary": "Combining two or more items and selling them as one good, a practice called\nbundling, can be a very effective strategy for reducing the costs of producing,\nmarketing, and selling goods. In this paper, we consider a form of multi-issue\nnegotiation where a shop negotiates both the contents and the price of bundles\nof goods with his customers. We present some key insights about, as well as a\ntechnique for, locating mutually beneficial alternatives to the bundle\ncurrently under negotiation. The essence of our approach lies in combining\nhistorical sales data, condensed into aggregate knowledge, with current data\nabout the ongoing negotiation process, to exploit these insights. In\nparticular, when negotiating a given bundle of goods with a customer, the shop\nanalyzes the sequence of the customer's offers to determine the progress in the\nnegotiation process. In addition, it uses aggregate knowledge concerning\ncustomers' valuations of goods in general. We show how the shop can use these\ntwo sources of data to locate promising alternatives to the current bundle.\nWhen the current negotiation's progress slows down, the shop may suggest the\nmost promising of those alternatives and, depending on the customer's response,\ncontinue negotiating about the alternative bundle, or propose another\nalternative. Extensive computer simulation experiments show that our approach\nincreases the speed with which deals are reached, as well as the number and\nquality of the deals reached, as compared to a benchmark. In addition, we show\nthat the performance of our system is robust to a variety of changes in the\nnegotiation strategies employed by the customers.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a methodology for optimal target detection in a multi\nsensor surveillance system. The system consists of mobile sensors that guard a\nrectangular surveillance zone crisscrossed by moving targets. Targets percolate\nthe surveillance zone in a poisson fashion with uniform velocities. Under these\nstatistics this paper computes a motion strategy for a sensor that maximizes\ntarget detections for the next T time steps. A coordination mechanism between\nsensors ensures that overlapping areas between sensors is reduced. This\ncoordination mechanism is interleaved with the motion strategy computation to\nreduce detections of the same target by more than one sensor. To avoid an\nexhaustive search in the joint space of all sensors the coordination mechanism\nconstraints the search by assigning priorities to the sensors. A comparison of\nthis methodology with other multi target tracking schemes verifies its efficacy\nin maximizing detections. A tabulation of these comparisons is reported in\nresults section of the paper",

    "summary": "Organization and coordination of agents within large-scale, complex,\ndistributed environments is one of the primary challenges in the field of\nmulti-agent systems. A lot of interest has surfaced recently around self-*\n(self-organizing, self-managing, self-optimizing, self-protecting) agents. This\npaper presents polymorphic self-* agents that evolve a core set of roles and\nbehavior based on environmental cues. The agents adapt these roles based on the\nchanging demands of the environment, and are directly implementable in computer\nsystems applications. The design combines strategies from game theory,\nstigmergy, and other biologically inspired models to address fault mitigation\nin large-scale, real-time, distributed systems. The agents are embedded within\nthe individual digital signal processors of BTeV, a High Energy Physics\nexperiment consisting of 2500 such processors. Results obtained using a SWARM\nsimulation of the BTeV environment demonstrate the polymorphic character of the\nagents, and show how this design exceeds performance and reliability metrics\nobtained from comparable centralized, and even traditional decentralized\napproaches.",

    "summary": "Simulations of artificial stock markets were considered as early as 1964 and\nmulti-agent ones were introduced as early as 1989. Starting the early 90's,\ncollaborations of economists and physicists produced increasingly realistic\nsimulation platforms. Currently, the market stylized facts are easily\nreproduced and one has now to address the realistic details of the Market\nMicrostructure and of the Traders Behaviour. This calls for new methods and\ntools capable of bridging smoothly between simulations and experiments in\neconomics.\n  We propose here the following Avatar-Based Method (ABM). The subjects\nimplement and maintain their Avatars (programs encoding their personal decision\nmaking procedures) on NatLab, a market simulation platform. Once these\nprocedures are fed in a computer edible format, they can be operationally used\nas such without the need for belabouring, interpreting or conceptualising them.\nThus ABM short-circuits the usual behavioural economics experiments that search\nfor the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjects behaviour. Finally,\nABM maintains a level of objectivity close to the classical behaviourism while\nextending its scope to subjects' decision making mechanisms.\n  We report on experiments where Avatars designed and maintained by humans from\ndifferent backgrounds (including real traders) compete in a continuous\ndouble-auction market. We hope this unbiased way of capturing the adaptive\nevolution of real subjects behaviour may lead to a new kind of behavioural\neconomics experiments with a high degree of reliability, analysability and\nreproducibility.",

Nonetheless, we prove that when the number of voters\nis much greater than the number of candidates--although the number of voters\nmay still be polynomial in the number of candidates--a simple greedy algorithm\nvery frequently finds the Dodgson winners in such a way that it ``knows'' that\nit has found them, and furthermore the algorithm never incorrectly declares a\nnonwinner to be a winner.",

However, standard propositional logics for knowledge and\nawareness cannot express the fact that an agent knows that there are facts of\nwhich he is unaware without there being an explicit fact that the agent knows\nhe is unaware of. We propose a logic for reasoning about knowledge of\nunawareness, by extending Fagin and Halpern's \\emph{Logic of General\nAwareness}. The logic allows quantification over variables, so that there is a\nformula in the language that can express the fact that ``an agent explicitly\nknows that there exists a fact of which he is unaware''. Moreover, that formula\ncan be true without the agent explicitly knowing that he is unaware of any\nparticular formula. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization of the\nlogic, using standard axioms from the literature to capture the quantification\noperator. Finally, we show that the validity problem for the logic is\nrecursively enumerable, but not decidable.",

    "summary": "Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems\noperating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their\nbehavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in\norder to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms\nfor task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication\nbetween robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a\nlack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult\nto design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic\ntask allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between\ntwo types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the\nabsence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the\nstate of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task\nto choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as\nstochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.\nSpecifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the\nchoice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The\nmathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The\nmodel's predictions agree very closely with experimental results from\nsensor-based simulations.",

The research presented here is intended to be a\nstep towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale\nmachines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form\nstrands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified\nmeshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a\nstrand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an\nunfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which\nthe bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of\nmachine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes.\nA simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of\nunbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in\nthe soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the\npolygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety\nof polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing\nthe sequence of machine types in the seed.",

A searchlight is a ray emitted by an agent which cannot\npenetrate the boundary of the environment. A point is detected by a searchlight\nif and only if the point is on the ray at some instant. Targets are points\nwhich can move continuously with unbounded speed. The objective of the proposed\nalgorithms is for the agents to coordinate the slewing (rotation about a point)\nof their searchlights in a distributed manner, i.e., using only local sensing\nand limited communication, such that any target will necessarily be detected in\nfinite time. The first algorithm we develop, called the DOWSS (Distributed One\nWay Sweep Strategy), is a distributed version of a known algorithm described\noriginally in 1990 by Sugihara et al \\cite{KS-IS-MY:90}, but it can be very\nslow in clearing the entire environment because only one searchlight may slew\nat a time. In an effort to reduce the time to clear the environment, we develop\na second algorithm, called the PTSS (Parallel Tree Sweep Strategy), in which\nsearchlights sweep in parallel if guards are placed according to an environment\npartition belonging to a class we call PTSS partitions.

We provide direct evidence that\nfor five human activity patterns the timing of individual human actions follow\nnon-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events\nseparated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of\nhuman behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when\nindividuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the\ntasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few\nexperiencing very long waiting times. We discuss two queueing models that\ncapture human activity.

We relax this assumption by considering extensive\ngames where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In\nparticular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.\nWe show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game\nfrom the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We\nprovide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with\nawareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results\nto games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a\nplayer j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where\npayers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs\nare incompatible with a common prior.",

We model the interaction among the nodes as a directed\ngraph with weights (possibly) dependent on the radio channels and we pose\nspecial attention to the effect of the propagation delay occurring in the\nexchange of data among sensors, as a function of the network geometry. We\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a\nconsensus on globally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results\nproved in this work is that a consensus is reached with exponential convergence\nspeed for any bounded delay condition if and only if the directed graph is\nquasi-strongly connected. We provide a closed form expression for the global\nconsensus, showing that the effect of delays is, in general, the introduction\nof a bias in the final decision. Finally, we exploit our closed form expression\nto devise a double-step consensus mechanism able to provide an unbiased\nestimate with minimum extra complexity, without the need to know or estimate\nthe channel parameters.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of power efficient uplink scheduling\nin a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system over a fading wireless\nchannel. The objective is to minimize the power expenditure of each user\nsubject to satisfying individual user delay. We make the practical assumption\nthat the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of\nthe user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure\nof a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy\nunder for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown\nsystem statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest\ndetermining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on\nits channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm\nfor a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer\noccupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus\naddresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is\ndetermined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our\nsimulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is\nindeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the\nperformance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite\nlow.",

    "summary": "We consider the problem of computing Nash Equilibria of action-graph games\n(AGGs). AGGs, introduced by Bhat and Leyton-Brown, is a succinct representation\nof games that encapsulates both \"local\" dependencies as in graphical games, and\npartial indifference to other agents' identities as in anonymous games, which\noccur in many natural settings. This is achieved by specifying a graph on the\nset of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends\nonly on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the\naction graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing\nmixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of\nagent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness\nresults for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is\nunconstrained. In particular, we show that even if the action graph is a tree,\nbut the number of agent-types is unconstrained, it is NP-complete to decide the\nexistence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a\nmixed Nash equilibrium (even an approximate one); similarly for symmetric AGGs\n(all agents belong to a single type), if we allow arbitrary treewidth.

Unlike analytical models, a\nsimulation model is not solved but is run and the changes of system states can\nbe observed at any point in time. This provides an insight into system dynamics\nrather than just predicting the output of a system based on specific inputs.\nSimulation is not a decision making tool but a decision support tool, allowing\nbetter informed decisions to be made.

An optimization in terms of symmetry can be combined with the\nimplementation of higher and heterogeniously distributed walking speeds by\nrepresenting different walking speeds via different amounts of cells an agent\nmay move during one round. Therefore all different possible neighborhoods for\nspeeds up to v = 10 (cells per round) will be examined for the amount of\ndeviation from radial symmetry. Simple criteria will be stated which will allow\nfind an optimal neighborhood for each speed.

SANA promises a better protection against intruders than\ncommon known protection systems through an adaptive self-management while\nkeeping the resources efficiently by an intelligent reduction of redundancies.\nWe introduce a library of several novel and common used protection components\nand evaluate the performance of SANA by a proof-of-concept implementation.",

    "summary": "This paper considers a non-cooperative game in which competing users sharing\na frequency-selective interference channel selfishly optimize their power\nallocation in order to improve their achievable rates. Previously, it was shown\nthat a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state information\ncan make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performance\ncompared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterative\nwater-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. This paper\ndiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its\nexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To\ncharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural\nequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the\ninvestigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash\nequilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of\nthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms\nto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.\nNumerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori\nknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the\nrequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that\nimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other\nparticipants in the water-filling game.",

    "summary": "Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are funda- mental tasks for a\nset of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in distinguishing a unique\nrobot, called the leader. The latter aims in arranging the robots in the plane\nto form any given pattern. The solv- ability of both these tasks turns out to\nbe necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. In this paper, we study\nthe relationship between these two tasks in a model, called CORDA, wherein the\nrobots are weak in several aspects. In particular, they are fully asynchronous\nand they have no direct means of communication. They cannot remember any\nprevious observation nor computation performed in any previous step. Such\nrobots are said to be oblivious. The robots are also uniform and anonymous,\ni.e, they all have the same program using no global parameter (such as an\nidentity) allowing to differentiate any of them. Moreover, we assume that none\nof them share any kind of common coordinate mechanism or common sense of\ndirection and we discuss the influence of a common handedness (i.e.,\nchirality). In such a system, Flochini et al. proved in [11] that it is\npossible to elect a leader for n \\geq 3 robots if it is possible to form any\npattern for n \\geq 3. In this paper, we show that the converse is true for n\n\\geq 4 when the robots share a common handedness and for n \\geq 5 when they do\nnot. Thus, we deduce that with chirality (resp. without chirality) both\nproblems are equivalent for n \\geq 4 (resp. n \\geq 5) in CORDA.",

    "summary": "We investigate ways for the exchange of information (explicit communication)\namong deaf and dumb mobile robots scattered in the plane. We introduce the use\nof movement-signals (analogously to flight signals and bees waggle) as a mean\nto transfer messages, enabling the use of distributed algorithms among the\nrobots. We propose one-to-one deterministic movement protocols that implement\nexplicit communication. We first present protocols for synchronous robots. We\nbegin with a very simple coding protocol for two robots. Based on on this\nprotocol, we provide one-to-one communication for any system of n \\geq 2 robots\nequipped with observable IDs that agree on a common direction (sense of\ndirection). We then propose two solutions enabling one-to-one communication\namong anonymous robots. Since the robots are devoid of observable IDs, both\nprotocols build recognition mechanisms using the (weak) capabilities offered to\nthe robots. The first protocol assumes that the robots agree on a common\ndirection and a common handedness (chirality), while the second protocol\nassumes chirality only. Next, we show how the movements of robots can provide\nimplicit acknowledgments in asynchronous systems. We use this result to design\nasynchronous one-to-one communication with two robots only. Finally, we combine\nthis solution with the schemes developed in synchronous settings to fit the\ngeneral case of asynchronous one-to-one communication among any number of\nrobots. Our protocols enable the use of distributing algorithms based on\nmessage exchanges among swarms of Stigmergic robots. Furthermore, they provides\nrobots equipped with means of communication to overcome faults of their\ncommunication device.",

    "summary": "The task of managing general game playing in a multi-agent system is the\nproblem addressed in this paper. It is considered to be done by an agent. There\nare many reasons for constructing such an agent, called general game management\nagent. This agent manages strategic interactions between other agents -\nplayers, natural or also artificial. The agent records the interaction for\nfurther benchmarking and analysis. He can also be used for a kind of restricted\ncommunications. His behavior is defined by a game description written in a\nlogic-based language. The language, we present for this application, is more\nexpressive than the language GDL, which is already used for such purposes. Our\nlanguage can represent imperfect information and time dependent elements of a\ngame. Time dependent elements like delays and timeouts are of crucial\nimportance for interactions between players with bounded processing power like\nhumans. We provide examples to show the feasibility of our approach. A way for\ngame theoretical solving of an interaction description in our language is\nconsidered as future work.",

    "summary": "In a society of completely selfish individuals where everybody is only\ninterested in maximizing his own payoff, does any equilibrium exist for the\nsociety? John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always\nexists such that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy.\nNash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers a\nmathematical foundation for social science and economy. However, it is\nimportant from both a theoretical and a practical point of view to understand\ngame playing where individuals are less selfish. This paper offers a\nconstructive generalization of Nash equilibrium to study n-person games where\nthe selfishness of individuals can be defined at any level, including the\nextreme of complete selfishness. The generalization is constructive since it\noffers a protocol for individuals in a society to reach an equilibrium. Most\nimportantly, this paper presents experimental results and theoretical\ninvestigation to show that the individuals in a society can reduce their\nselfishness level together to reach a new equilibrium where they can have\nbetter payoffs and the society is more stable at the same time. This study\nsuggests that, for the benefit of everyone in a society (including the\nfinancial market), the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be\ncontrolled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed\nregulations.",

Economists traditionally use mathematical methods,\nmainly game theory, to analyze auctions and design new auction forms. However,\ndue to the high complexity of auctions, the mathematical models are typically\nsimplified to obtain results, and this makes it difficult to apply results\nderived from such models to market environments in the real world.

    "summary": "Experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the\nstability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm as the\nnumber of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex.\nFor cooperative agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global\nmetric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the\nglobal performance metric over time. If the global metric improves and\neventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the\nsystem's stability.\n  The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better\nexperimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale\nadaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the\nstability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an\nunderlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in\nperformance. We then propose an alternative metric that relies on agents' local\npolicies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective\n(than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of\nMARL algorithms.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider the problem of designing incentive compatible\nauctions for multiple (homogeneous) units of a good, when bidders have private\nvaluations and private budget constraints. When only the valuations are private\nand the budgets are public, Dobzinski {\\em et al} show that the {\\em adaptive\nclinching} auction is the unique incentive-compatible auction achieving\nPareto-optimality. They further show thatthere is no deterministic\nPareto-optimal auction with private budgets. Our main contribution is to show\nthe following Budget Monotonicity property of this auction: When there is only\none infinitely divisible good, a bidder cannot improve her utility by reporting\na budget smaller than the truth. This implies that a randomized modification to\nthe adaptive clinching auction is incentive compatible and Pareto-optimal with\nprivate budgets.\n  The Budget Monotonicity property also implies other improved results in this\ncontext. For revenue maximization, the same auction improves the best-known\ncompetitive ratio due to Abrams by a factor of 4, and asymptotically approaches\nthe performance of the optimal single-price auction.\n  Finally, we consider the problem of revenue maximization (or social welfare)\nin a Bayesian setting. We allow the bidders have public size constraints (on\nthe amount of good they are willing to buy) in addition to private budget\nconstraints. We show a simple poly-time computable 5.83-approximation to the\noptimal Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism, that is implementable in\ndominant strategies. Our technique again crucially needs the ability to prevent\nbidders from over-reporting budgets via randomization.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a bid optimizer for sponsored keyword search\nauctions which leads to better retention of advertisers by yielding attractive\nutilities to the advertisers without decreasing the revenue to the search\nengine. The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search\nengine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm\ntransforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a\ncorrelated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The\nalgorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine\nand the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating\nthe characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the\nplayers involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the\ncharacteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of\nallocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the\nadvertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid\nprofile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a\nstandard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the\nallocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The\ncorrelated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and\nalso a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game. Through detailed\nsimulation experiments, we show that the proposed bid optimizer retains more\ncustomers than a plain GSP mechanism and also yields better long-run utilities\nto the search engine and the advertisers.",

    "summary": "We view Digital Ecosystems to be the digital counterparts of biological\necosystems, which are considered to be robust, self-organising and scalable\narchitectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. So, this\nwork is concerned with the creation, investigation, and optimisation of Digital\nEcosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems.\nFirst, we created the Digital Ecosystem, a novel optimisation technique\ninspired by biological ecosystems, where the optimisation works at two levels:\na first optimisation, migration of agents which are distributed in a\ndecentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this\nprocess feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that\noperates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy\nlocally relevant constraints. We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted\nmigration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent\noptimisation of the agent migration patterns. Overall, we have advanced the\nunderstanding of creating Digital Ecosystems, the self-organisation that occurs\nwithin them, and the optimisation of their Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture.",

Ecosystems are\nthought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve\ncomplex, dynamic problems. However, the computing technologies that contribute\nto these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research.\nHere, we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to\nproviding the necessary self-organising features, including Multi-Agent\nSystems, Service-Oriented Architectures, and distributed evolutionary\ncomputing. The potential for exploiting these properties in digital ecosystems\nis considered, suggesting how several key features of biological ecosystems can\nbe exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking these features\nmay assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising architectures. An\nexample architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail. The\nDigital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through simulations,\nconsidering the self-organised diversity of its evolving agent populations\nrelative to the user request behaviour.",

    "publish": "2009-10-05T22:53:01Z", 
    "summary": "Display advertising has traditionally been sold via guaranteed contracts -- a\nguaranteed contract is a deal between a publisher and an advertiser to allocate\na certain number of impressions over a certain period, for a pre-specified\nprice per impression. However, as spot markets for display ads, such as the\nRightMedia Exchange, have grown in prominence, the selection of advertisements\nto show on a given page is increasingly being chosen based on price, using an\nauction. As the number of participants in the exchange grows, the price of an\nimpressions becomes a signal of its value. This correlation between price and\nvalue means that a seller implementing the contract through bidding should\noffer the contract buyer a range of prices, and not just the cheapest\nimpressions necessary to fulfill its demand.\n  Implementing a contract using a range of prices, is akin to creating a mutual\nfund of advertising impressions, and requires {\\em randomized bidding}. We\ncharacterize what allocations can be implemented with randomized bidding,\nnamely those where the desired share obtained at each price is a non-increasing\nfunction of price. In addition, we provide a full characterization of when a\nset of campaigns are compatible and how to implement them with randomized\nbidding strategies.",

    "summary": "TIntelligent multi agent systems have great potentials to use in different\npurposes and research areas. One of the important issues to apply intelligent\nmulti agent systems in real world and virtual environment is to develop a\nframework that support machine learning model to reflect the whole complexity\nof the real world. In this paper, we proposed a framework of intelligent agent\nbased neural network classification model to solve the problem of gap between\ntwo applicable flows of intelligent multi agent technology and learning model\nfrom real environment. We consider the new Supervised Multilayers Feed Forward\nNeural Network (SMFFNN) model as an intelligent classification for learning\nmodel in the framework. The framework earns the information from the respective\nenvironment and its behavior can be recognized by the weights. Therefore, the\nSMFFNN model that lies in the framework will give more benefits in finding the\nsuitable information and the real weights from the environment which result for\nbetter recognition. The framework is applicable to different domains\nsuccessfully and for the potential case study, the clinical organization and\nits domain is considered for the proposed framework",

This kind of classifi cation can be referred as anomaly\ndetection, which discriminates anomalous behaviour from normal behaviour in\ncomputer systems. One popular solution for anomaly detection is Artifi cial\nImmune Sys- tems (AIS). AIS are adaptive systems inspired by theoretical\nimmunology and observed immune functions, principles and models which are\napplied to prob- lem solving. The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA)[2] is an AIS\nalgorithm that is developed specifi cally for anomaly detection. It has been\nsuccessfully applied to intrusion detection in computer security. It is\nbelieved that agent-based mod- elling is an ideal approach for implementing\nAIS, as intelligent agents could be the perfect representations of immune\nentities in AIS. This model evaluates the feasibility of re-implementing the\nDCA in an agent-based simulation environ- ment called AnyLogic, where the\nimmune entities in the DCA are represented by intelligent agents. If this model\ncan be successfully implemented, it makes it possible to implement more\ncomplicated and adaptive AIS models in the agent-based simulation environment.",

    "summary": "In this paper we consider an extension to the classical definition of\ncongestion games (CG) in which multiple users share the same set of resources\nand their payoff for using any resource is a function of the total number of\nusers sharing it. The classical congestion games enjoy some very appealing\nproperties, including the existence of a Nash equilibrium and that every\nimprovement path is finite and leads to such a NE (also called the finite\nimprovement property or FIP), which is also a local optimum to a potential\nfunction. On the other hand, this class of games does not model well the\ncongestion or resource sharing in a wireless context, a prominent feature of\nwhich is spatial reuse. What this translates to in the context of a congestion\ngame is that a users payoff for using a resource (interpreted as a channel) is\na function of the its number of its interfering users sharing that channel,\nrather than the total number among all users. This makes the problem quite\ndifferent. We will call this the congestion game with resource reuse (CG-RR).\nIn this paper we study intrinsic properties of such a game; in particular, we\nseek to address under what conditions on the underlying network this game\npossesses the FIP or NE. We also discuss the implications of these results when\napplied to wireless spectrum sharing",

These functions are\nsuccinctly representable and generalize linear cost functions. In this paper we\nstudy the following fundamental combinatorial optimization problems: Edge\nCover, Spanning Tree, Perfect Matching and Shortest Path, and obtain tight\nupper and lower bounds for these problems.\n  The main technical contribution of this paper is designing novel adaptive\ngreedy algorithms for the above problems.

    "summary": "Urban transportation is a complex phenomenon. Since many agents are\nconstantly interacting in parallel, it is difficult to predict the future state\nof a transportation system. Because of this, optimization techniques tend to\ngive obsolete solutions, as the problem changes before it can be optimized. An\nalternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved\nwith self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the\nelements of the system follow local rules to achieve a global solution. Like\nthis, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new\nconfiguration.\n  In this chapter, I will review recent, current, and future work on\nself-organizing transportation systems. Self-organizing traffic lights have\nproven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public\ntransportation systems, simple rules are being explored to prevent the \"equal\nheadway instability\" phenomenon. The methods we have used can be also applied\nto other urban transportation systems and their generality is discussed.",

    "summary": "Background: Many different simulation frameworks, in different topics, need\nto treat realistic datasets to initialize and calibrate the system. A precise\nreproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable\nforecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by\ntheir age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical\nconstraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head,\ndifference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a\npopulation is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)\nindividual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often\nvery important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic\nevolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different\nsources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number\nof combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants)\nmakes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we\ndeveloped a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable.\nConclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot\nmunicipalities in Auvergne region (France), to illustrate the approach. The\ngenerated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical\ndatasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable\ncomputational time.",

    "summary": "Using mobile robots for autonomous patrolling of environments to prevent\nintrusions is a topic of increasing practical relevance. One of the most\nchallenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling\nstrategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers\nin order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this\nproblem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly\nconsidering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that\nof modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the\nintruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective\npatrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal\nframework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends\nthe previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments\nwith arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main\noriginal contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game\nfor generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic\nequilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,\nand an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is\na set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph. Both\nthe algorithms are analytically studied and experimentally validated, to assess\ntheir properties and efficiency.",

The extended naming game models an environment\nsimilar to one that can be found in the context of social bookmarking and\ncollaborative tagging sites where users tag sites using appropriate labels, but\nalso mimics an important aspect in the field of human-based image labeling.\nAlthough the extended naming game is non-deterministic in its word selection,\nwe show that consensus towards a common vocabulary is reached.

If it\nis the case, it joins the group which has proportionally the closest average\nopinion from its. If it decides to interact with one of its neighbour, it\nbecomes closer in opinion to it when its opinion and the one of the\nselected-to-interact neighbour are less distant from the threshold. From the\nstudy of this coupled model, we discover some surprising behaviours compared to\nthe known behaviour of the Deffuant bounded confidence model(BC): The coupled\nmodel exhibits a total consensus for an threshold value lower than the BC\nmodel; the distribution of sizes of the groups changes: some groups become\nlarger while other decrease in size, sometimes until containing only one\nindividual; from the point of view of the groups, the consensus remains for a\nlarge set of threshold values while, looking at the population level, there are\na lot of opinion clusters.",

    "summary": "Bargaining networks model social or economic situations in which agents seek\nto form the most lucrative partnership with another agent from among several\nalternatives. There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash\nbargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,\nso that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be\ncomputed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced\nin [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)\nsolutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a\ncertain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the\nbound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network\nsize for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a\ngraph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly\nbounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \\eps-UD solution in time\npoly(|V|,1/\\eps). We also provide a fast local algorithm for finding \\eps-UD\nsolution, providing further justification that a market can find such a\nsolution.",

The latter process is commonly referred to as\ncultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and\npartly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists,\npaleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet\nbeen reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global\nLand Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model\nfor regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian\ngeoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is\nable to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous\nspace-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in\ncontrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also\ndescribes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the\nmodel analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information\nexchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well\nhave arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and\nCentral Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both\ndemic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the\nwestern European transition equally well, (3) [...]",

    "title": "Existence of Multiagent Equilibria with Limited Agents", 
    "publish": "2011-06-30T20:35:15Z", 
    "summary": "Multiagent learning is a necessary yet challenging problem as multiagent\nsystems become more prevalent and environments become more dynamic. Much of the\ngroundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory, in\nparticular, the concept of Nash equilibria. Learners that directly learn an\nequilibrium obviously rely on their existence. Learners that instead seek to\nplay optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria\nsince equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,\nagents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical\nlimitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction\nand approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article\nexplores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and\nlimitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria\ncontinue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects\nlimitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of\nequilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we\nmake three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence\nof equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that\npreserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations\nthat satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a\nspecific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of\nlimited agents. These results demonstrate that learning with limitations is\nfeasible, when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold.",

    "summary": "This contribution proposes a method to make agents in a microscopic\nsimulation of pedestrian traffic walk approximately along a path of estimated\nminimal remaining travel time to their destination. Usually models of\npedestrian dynamics are (implicitly) built on the assumption that pedestrians\nwalk along the shortest path. Model elements formulated to make pedestrians\nlocally avoid collisions and intrusion into personal space do not produce\nmotion on quickest paths. Therefore a special model element is needed, if one\nwants to model and simulate pedestrians for whom travel time matters most (e.g.\ntravelers in a station hall who are late for a train). Here such a model\nelement is proposed, discussed and used within the Social Force Model.",

Each node in the population is\neither a \\emph{destination} (interested in the content) or a potential\n\\emph{relay} (not yet interested in the content). There is an interest\nevolution process by which nodes not yet interested in the content (i.e.,\nrelays) can become interested (i.e., become destinations) on learning about the\npopularity of the content (i.e., the number of already interested nodes). In\nour work, the interest in the content evolves under the \\emph{linear threshold\nmodel}. The content is copied between nodes when they make random contact. For\nthis we employ a controlled epidemic spread model. We model the joint evolution\nof the copying process and the interest evolution process, and derive the joint\nfluid limit ordinary differential equations.

There is an inherent tradeoff between how general a\nlanguage is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is\ncomputationally to optimize and solve such games. One prominent such language\nis the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation [14],\nwhich maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge\nweighted graph.\n  We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs.\nThe agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition\nis the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The\noptimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that\nmaximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding\nthe optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is\nalso intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are\namenable for many other combinatorial problems.

    "publish": "2011-09-09T20:24:38Z", 
    "summary": "This paper extends the framework of partially observable Markov decision\nprocesses (POMDPs) to multi-agent settings by incorporating the notion of agent\nmodels into the state space. Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of\nthe environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates\nto maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the\nagents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable\nor observable by other agents. We show that important properties of POMDPs,\nsuch as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise\nlinearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework. Our\napproach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which\nuses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm. We seek to avoid some of the\ndrawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture\noff-equilibrium behaviors. We do so at the cost of having to represent, process\nand continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agents beliefs may be\narbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only\nasymptotically computable. However, approximate belief updates and\napproximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a\nsimple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value\nfunctions.",

    "summary": "The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was one of the first great civilizations\nin prehistory. This bronze age civilization flourished from the end of the\nfourth millennium BC. It disintegrated during the second millennium BC; despite\nmuch research effort, this decline is not well understood. Less research has\nbeen devoted to the emergence of the IVC, which shows continuous cultural\nprecursors since at least the seventh millennium BC. To understand the decline,\nwe believe it is necessary to investigate the rise of the IVC, i.e., the\nestablishment of agriculture and livestock, dense populations and technological\ndevelopments 7000--3000 BC. Although much archaeological information is\navailable, our capability to investigate the system is hindered by poorly\nresolved chronology, and by a lack of field work in the intermediate areas\nbetween the Indus valley and Mesopotamia. We thus employ a complementary\nnumerical simulation to develop a consistent picture of technology,\nagropastoralism and population developments in the IVC domain. Results from\nthis Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator show that there is\n(1) fair agreement between the simulated timing of the agricultural transition\nand radiocarbon dates from early agricultural sites, but the transition is\nsimulated first in India then Pakistan; (2) an independent agropastoralism\ndeveloping on the Indian subcontinent; and (3) a positive relationship between\narcheological artifact richness and simulated population density which remains\nto be quantified.",

Since each of them yields a different outcome, a key problem is\nto decide which one to use in which circumstances. Specifically, we consider\nthis question for a model in which the agents have time constraints (in the\nform of both deadlines and discount factors) and information uncertainty (in\nthat the agents do not know the opponents utility function). For this model, we\nconsider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and\ndetermine equilibria for each case for each procedure. In so doing, we show\nthat the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then\ngo on to show that, although the package deal may be computationally more\ncomplex than the other two procedures, it generates Pareto optimal outcomes\n(unlike the other two), it has similar earliest and latest possible times of\nagreement to the simultaneous procedure (which is better than the sequential\nprocedure), and that it (like the other two procedures) generates a unique\noutcome only under certain conditions (which we define).",

There is also external, user-generated input into\nthe Multi-Agent System. As so much information is stored in the connections,\nagents are often memory-less. This memory-less property, together with the\nrandomness of the external input, has allowed us to model Multi-Agent Systems\nusing Markov chains. In this paper, we look at Multi-Agent Systems that evolve,\ni.e. the number of agents varies according to the fitness of the individual\nagents. We extend our Markov chain model, and define stability. This is the\nstart of a methodology to control Multi-Agent Systems. We then build upon this\nto construct an entropy-based definition for the degree of instability (entropy\nof the limit probabilities), which we used to perform a stability analysis. We\nthen investigated the stability of evolving agent populations through\nsimulation, and show that the results are consistent with the original\ndefinition of stability in non-evolving Multi-Agent Systems, proposed by Chli\nand De Wilde.

In this paper, we have proposed a thoroughly\ndistributed algorithm to support the QoS in ad hoc networks. This algorithm\nguarantees the QoS of the real-time applications vis-a-vis each other and\nbest-effort flows as well. The algorithm suggested in this paper dynamically\nregulates the Contention Window of the flows and serves the flows in terms of\ntheir requests QoS choosing the smallest CW in every node. This algorithm also\nuses the fixed and/or less stationary nodes for the transmission of real-time\nflows by increasing the QoS of the multimedia flows. This algorithm is\npreferred because it prioritizes the flows that are of the same class but have\nnot obtained favorite QoS compared to other flows of the same class in addition\nto classifying the flows in the network and offering better services to the\nclasses of higher priority. All this occur without the controlled packets\nforwarding and resource reserving and freeing method. We have proved the\ncorrectness of this algorithm using Markov's mathematical model.",

The new version utilizes an effective\ncriterion for escaping from the local optimum points. In contrast to the\nclassical EAC algorithms, the proposed algorithm uses only a global updating,\nwhich will increase pheromone on the edges of the best (i.e. the shortest)\nroute and will at the same time decrease the amount of pheromone on the edges\nof the worst (i.e. the longest) route. In order to assess the efficiency of the\nnew algorithm, some standard traveling salesman problems (TSPs) were studied\nand their results were compared with classical EAC and other well-known\nmeta-heuristic algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has\nbeen able to improve the efficiency of the algorithms in all instances and it\nis competitive with other algorithms.",

    "publish": "2012-02-13T15:57:51Z", 
    "summary": "Achieving joint objectives by teams of cooperative planning agents requires\nsignificant coordination and communication efforts. For a single-agent system\nfacing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair\nthe failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms\nof time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication\ncomplexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication\noverhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in\ndecentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint\nobjectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower\ncommunication overhead than replanning from scratch.\n  The contribution of the presented paper is threefold. Firstly, we formally\nintroduce the multi-agent plan repair problem and formally present the core\nhypothesis underlying our work. Secondly, we propose three algorithms for\nmulti-agent plan repair reducing the problem to specialized instances of the\nmulti-agent planning problem. Finally, we present results of experimental\nvalidation confirming the core hypothesis of the paper.",

    "summary": "Model checking verifies that a model of a system satisfies a given property,\nand otherwise produces a counter-example explaining the violation. The verified\nproperties are formally expressed in temporal logics. Some temporal logics,\nsuch as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole\ncomputation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.\nThis branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal\nlogics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition\nrelations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and\nepistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce\nlinear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation\npath of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially\nexplained by a linear counter-example.\n  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like\nannotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL\n(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions\nlabeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching\nstructure that supports more complete description of property violations.\nElements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to\ngive a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of\nthese richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of\nbranches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties.\n  This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate\ncounter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation\nalgorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples\nin CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been\nimplemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export\nbranching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical\ninterface to visualize and browse them.",

Each player is a node in a social network and strives to form a good\nmatch with a neighboring player. We consider the existence, computation, and\ninefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players wants to\ndeviate. When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show\nthat incorporating the well-being of other players into their matching\ndecisions significantly decreases the price of stability, while the price of\nanarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching achieving the\nprice of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time.\nWe extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched\nto each other may receive different utilities from the match. For this more\ngeneral case, we show that incorporating social context (i.e., \"caring about\nyour friends\") can make an even larger difference, and greatly reduce the price\nof anarchy. We show a variety of existence results, and present upper and lower\nbounds on the prices of anarchy and stability for various matching utility\nstructures.

    "summary": "User cooperation although improves performance of wireless systems, it\nrequires incentives for the potential cooperating nodes to spend their energy\nacting as relays. Moreover, these potential relays are better informed than the\nsource about their transmission costs, which depend on the exact channel\nconditions on their relay-destination links. This results in asymmetry of\navailable information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we use\ncontract theory to tackle the problem of relay selection under asymmetric\ninformation in OFDM-based cooperative wireless system that employs\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We first design incentive compatible\noffers/contracts, consisting of a menu of payments and desired\nsignal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)s at the destination and then the source broadcasts\nthis menu to nearby mobile nodes. The nearby mobile nodes who are willing to\nrelay notify back the source with the contracts they are willing to accept in\neach subcarrier. We show that when the source is under a budget constraint, the\nproblem of relay selection in each subcarrier in order to maximize the capacity\nis a nonlinear non-separable knapsack problem. We propose a heuristic relay\nselection scheme to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our\noverall mechanism and the heuristic solution with a simple relay selection\nscheme and selected numerical results showed that our solution performs better\nand is close to optimal.

    "summary": "The giant single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum exhibits complex\nmorphological adaptation and amoeboid movement as it forages for food and may\nbe seen as a minimal example of complex robotic behaviour. Swarm computation\nhas previously been used to explore how spatiotemporal complexity can emerge\nfrom, and be distributed within, simple component parts and their interactions.\nUsing a particle based swarm approach we explore the question of how to\ngenerate collective amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component\nparts in a model of P. polycephalum. The model collective behaves as a cohesive\nand deformable virtual material, approximating the local coupling within the\nplasmodium matrix. The collective generates de-novo and complex oscillatory\npatterns from simple local interactions. The origin of this motor behaviour is\ndistributed within the collective rendering is morphologically adaptive,\namenable to external influence, and robust to simulated environmental insult.\nWe show how to gain external influence over the collective movement by\nsimulated chemo-attraction (pulling towards nutrient stimuli) and simulated\nlight irradiation hazards (pushing from stimuli). The amorphous and distributed\nproperties of the collective are demonstrated by cleaving it into two\nindependent entities and fusing two separate entities to form a single device,\nthus enabling it to traverse narrow, separate or tortuous paths. We conclude by\nsummarising the contribution of the model to swarm based robotics and\nsoft-bodied modular robotics and discuss the future potential of such material\napproaches to the field.",

These are usually done by comparing measured\nproperties of the dynamics found in observation, experiments and simulation in\ncertain scenarios. For this the scenarios first need to be sensitive to\nparameter changes of a particular model or - if models are compared -\ndifferences between models. Second it is helpful if the exhibited differences\ncan be expressed in quantities which are as simple as possible ideally a single\nnumber. Such a scenario is proposed in this contribution together with\nevaluation measures. In an example evaluation of a particular model it is shown\nthat the proposed evaluation measures are very sensitive to parameter changes\nand therefore summarize differences effects of parameter changes and\ndifferences between models efficiently, sometimes in a single number. It is\nshown how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed\nexample scenario is broken in particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral\ndynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there is a symmetry\nbetween left- and right-chiral dynamics. In the course of the symmetry breaking\ndifferences between models and parameter settings are amplified which is the\norigin of the high sensitivity of the scenario against parameter changes.",

We formulate and solve\nthree problems representing three different Q-learning algorithms: namely,\ncentralized, distributed and partially distributed power control using\nQ-learning (CPC-Q, DPC-Q and PDPC-Q). CPCQ, although not of practical interest,\ncharacterizes the global optimum. Each of DPC-Q and PDPC-Q works in two\ndifferent learning paradigms: Independent (IL) and Cooperative (CL). The former\nis considered the simplest form for applying Qlearning in multi-agent\nscenarios, where all the femtocells learn independently. The latter is the\nproposed scheme in which femtocells share partial information during the\nlearning process in order to strike a balance between practical relevance and\nperformance. In terms of performance, the simulation results showed that the CL\nparadigm outperforms the IL paradigm and achieves an aggregate femtocells\ncapacity that is very close to the optimal one. For the practical relevance\nissue, we evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in real time, by\ndeploying new femtocells in the system during the learning process, where we\nshowed that DPC-Q in the CL paradigm is scalable to large number of femtocells\nand more robust to the network dynamics compared to the IL paradigm",

The\ncases in which these activities have been systematically integrated for a\nmutual benefit are still very few compared to the corpus of crowd related\nliterature.

Let I be a set of arbitrary\ncardinality (the set of actions) and assume that for each pair of distinct\nactions (i,j), we are given a number \\delta(i,j). We say that a function t,\nspecifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\\delta} if\nfor every pair of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \\delta(i,j) (and\nthus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\\delta(j,i)). While the approach that first comes to\nmind for analysing these definitions is an analytic/geometric one, it turns out\nthat graph-theoretic tools yield powerful results when applied to these\ndefinitions. Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely\nconstraints, and reduce the problem of satisfiability of a timely constraint to\nthe all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite I, furthermore to the\nnegative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that every\nsatisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key\nmilestone on the way to optimally solving a large class of coordination\nproblems - and reduce the problem of finding this minimal satisfying function,\nas well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints, to the\nall-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the\nconstructive definition of a \"nicely-behaved\" representative for each class of\ntimely constraints sharing the same set of satisfying functions.

For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of\ntheoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games\nby proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally\ndefine \\emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids\niteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that\nremoving iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a\nsmall poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the\nworst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield\nstrategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a\nnew modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more\nefficient and may be used to generate stronger strategies than previously\npossible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent\nthat was built using CFR and a novel game decomposition method. Our new agent\nwins the three-player events of the 2012 ACPC and defeats the winning\nthree-player programs from previous competitions while requiring less resources\nto generate than the 2011 winner.

The system we\nuse comprises a laser sensor and pressure sensors in shock absorbers to detect\nand quantify the intensity of the pothole, a centralized server which maintains\na database of locations of all the potholes which can be accessed by another\nunit inside the vehicle. A point to point connection device is also installed\nin vehicles so that, when a vehicle detects a pothole which is not in the\ndatabase, all the vehicles within a range of 20 meters are warned about the\npothole. The system computes a route with least number of potholes which is\nnearest to the desired destination . If the destination is unknown, then the\nsystem will check for potholes in the current road and displays the level of\ndamage. The system is flexible enough that the destination can be added,\nremoved or changed any time during the travel. The best possible route is\nsuggested by the system upon the alteration. We prove that the algorithm\nreturns an efficient path with least number of potholes.",

    "publish": "2013-05-30T23:55:26Z", 
    "summary": "Accurate location information is essential for many wireless sensor network\n(WSN) applications. A location-aware WSN generally includes two types of nodes:\nsensors whose locations to be determined and anchors whose locations are known\na priori. For range-based localization, sensors' locations are deduced from\nanchor-to-sensor and sensor-to-sensor range measurements. Localization accuracy\ndepends on the network parameters such as network connectivity and size. This\npaper provides a generalized theory that quantitatively characterizes such\nrelation between network parameters and localization accuracy. We use the\naverage degree as a connectivity metric and use geometric dilution of precision\n(DOP), equivalent to the Cramer-Rao bound, to quantify localization accuracy.\nWe prove a novel lower bound on expectation of average geometric DOP\n(LB-E-AGDOP) and derives a closed-form formula that relates LB-E-AGDOP to only\nthree parameters: average anchor degree, average sensor degree, and number of\nsensor nodes. The formula shows that localization accuracy is approximately\ninversely proportional to the average degree, and a higher ratio of average\nanchor degree to average sensor degree yields better localization accuracy.\nFurthermore, the paper demonstrates a strong connection between LB-E-AGDOP and\nthe best achievable accuracy. Finally, we validate the theory via numerical\nsimulations with three different random graph models.",

    "summary": "In a multi-agent system, agents coordinate to achieve global tasks through\nlocal communications. Coordination usually requires sufficient information\nflow, which is usually depicted by the connectivity of the communication\nnetwork. In a networked system, removal of some agents may cause a\ndisconnection. In order to maintain connectivity in agent removal, one can\ndesign a robust network topology that tolerates a finite number of agent\nlosses, and/or develop a control strategy that recovers connectivity. This\npaper proposes a decentralized control scheme based on a sequence of\nreplacements, each of which occurs between an agent and one of its immediate\nneighbors. The replacements always end with an agent, whose relocation does not\ncause a disconnection. We show that such an agent can be reached by a local\nrule utilizing only some local information available in agents' immediate\nneighborhoods. As such, the proposed message passing strategy guarantees the\nconnectivity maintenance in arbitrary agent removal.

How shall a designer of a multi-agent system program its identical agents\nto behave each in a different way? From a game theoretic perspective, such\nsituations lead to undesirable Nash equilibria. For example consider a resource\nallocation game in that two players compete for an exclusive access to a single\nresource. It has three Nash equilibria.

The evaluation provides control over the decision to\nobtain new knowledge or apply the acquired knowledge to new problems. We\ncombine two methods for learning from the observed information.

The second one, the classification method, categorizes the\ninformation in the observed data and determines to which set of categories the\nnew problems belong. Results show that agents are able to learn in conditions\nwhere common supervised learning algorithms fail, such as when agents do not\nknow the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the\nactions are visible.

By decentralized and\nautonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic\ninformation received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central\ndata processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried\nout by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system\nexploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share\nthis positional information with other flock members locally. Collective\nbehavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration\nfrom statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is\noptimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and\nerror-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented\nseveral fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved\nself-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance\ncapabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation\nflights (grid, rotating ring, straight line).

    "summary": "Investigating congestion in train rapid transit systems (RTS) in today's\nurban cities is a challenge compounded by limited data availability and\ndifficulties in model validation. Here, we integrate information from travel\nsmart card data, a mathematical model of route choice, and a full-scale\nagent-based model of the Singapore RTS to provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the congestion dynamics than can be obtained through\nanalytical modelling alone. Our model is empirically validated, and allows for\nclose inspection of the dynamics including station crowdedness, average travel\nduration, and frequency of missed trains---all highly pertinent factors in\nservice quality. Using current data, the crowdedness in all 121 stations\nappears to be distributed log-normally. In our preliminary scenarios, we\ninvestigate the effect of population growth on service quality. We find that\nthe current population (2 million) lies below a critical point; and increasing\nit beyond a factor of $\\sim10\\%$ leads to an exponential deterioration in\nservice quality. We also predict that incentivizing commuters to avoid the most\ncongested hours can bring modest improvements to the service quality provided\nthe population remains under the critical point. Finally, our model can be used\nto generate simulated data for analytical modelling when such data are not\nempirically available, as is often the case.",

In order to assist the development of\nmulti-agent systems, agent-oriented methodologies (AOM) have been created in\nthe last years to support modeling more and more complex applications in many\ndifferent domains. By defining in a non-ambiguous way concepts used in a\nspecific domain, Meta modeling may represent a step towards such\ninteroperability. In the Transport domain, this paper propose an agent-oriented\nmeta-model that provides rigorous concepts for conducting transportation system\nproblem modeling. The aim is to allow analysts to produce a transportation\nsystem model that precisely captures the knowledge of an organization so that\nan agent-oriented requirements specification of the system-to-be and its\noperational corporate environment can be derived from it. To this end, we\nextend and adapt an existing meta-model, Extended Gaia, to build a meta-model\nand an adequate model for transportation problems. Our new agent-oriented\nmeta-model aims to allow the analyst to model and specify any transportation\nsystem as a multi-agent system. Based on the proposed meta-model, we proposes\nan approach for modeling and evaluating the Transportation System based on\nStochastic Activity Network (SAN) components. The proposed process is based on\nseven steps from Recognition phase to Quantitative Analysis phase. These\nanalyzes are based on the Dependability models which are built using the\nformalism Stochastic Activity Network.

    "summary": "When autonomous agents are executing in the real world, the state of the\nworld as well as the objectives of the agent may change from the agent's\noriginal model. In such cases, the agent's planning process must modify the\nplan under execution to make it amenable to the new conditions, and to resume\nexecution. This brings up the replanning problem, and the various techniques\nthat have been proposed to solve it. In all, three main techniques -- based on\nthree different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work.\nAn open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this\nrequires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In\nthis paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by\ncompiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this\nnovel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not\ninterchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other.

Such arms races can, however, be hard to\nsustain, and it has been shown that the competing species often converge\nprematurely to certain classes of behaviours. In this paper, we investigate if\nand how novelty search, an evolutionary technique driven by behavioural\nnovelty, can overcome convergence in coevolution. We propose three methods for\napplying novelty search to coevolutionary systems with two species: (i) score\nboth populations according to behavioural novelty; (ii) score one population\naccording to novelty, and the other according to fitness; and (iii) score both\npopulations with a combination of novelty and fitness. We evaluate the methods\nin a predator-prey pursuit task. Our results show that novelty-based approaches\ncan evolve a significantly more diverse set of solutions, when compared to\ntraditional fitness-based coevolution.",

    "summary": "We consider approval-based committee voting, i.e. the setting where each\nvoter approves a subset of candidates, and these votes are then used to select\na fixed-size set of winners (committee). We propose a natural axiom for this\nsetting, which we call justified representation (JR).

We show that for every list of ballots it is possible to\nselect a committee that provides JR. However, it turns out that several\nprominent approval-based voting rules may fail to output such a committee. In\nparticular, while Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) always outputs a committee\nthat provides JR, Reweighted Approval Voting (RAV), a tractable approximation\nto PAV, does not have this property. We then introduce a stronger version of\nthe JR axiom, which we call extended justified representation (EJR), and show\nthat PAV satisfies EJR, while other rules we consider do not; indeed, EJR can\nbe used to characterize PAV within the class of weighted PAV rules. We also\nconsider several other questions related to JR and EJR, including the\nrelationship between JR/EJR and core stability, and the complexity of the\nassociated algorithmic problems.",

The focus is on\nprincipled methods for a single agent to cooperate with others. This motivates\ninvestigating the ad hoc teamwork problem in the context of individual decision\nmaking frameworks. However, individual decision making in multiagent settings\nfaces the task of having to reason about other agents' actions, which in turn\ninvolves reasoning about others. An established approximation that\noperationalizes this approach is to bound the infinite nesting from below by\nintroducing level 0 models. We show that a consequence of the finitely-nested\nmodeling is that we may not obtain optimal team solutions in cooperative\nsettings. We address this limitation by including models at level 0 whose\nsolutions involve learning. We demonstrate that the learning integrated into\nplanning in the context of interactive dynamic influence diagrams facilitates\noptimal team behavior, and is applicable to ad hoc teamwork.",

    "summary": "There is great potential to be explored regarding the use of agent-based\nmodelling and simulation as an alternative paradigm to investigate early-stage\ncancer interactions with the immune system. It does not suffer from some\nlimitations of ordinary differential equation models, such as the lack of\nstochasticity, representation of individual behaviours rather than aggregates\nand individual memory. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution\nof agent-based modelling and simulation when contrasted with stochastic\nversions of ODE models using early-stage cancer examples. We seek answers to\nthe following questions: (1) Does this new stochastic formulation produce\nsimilar results to the agent-based version? (2) Can these methods be used\ninterchangeably? (3) Do agent-based models outcomes reveal any benefit when\ncompared to the Gillespie results? To answer these research questions we\ninvestigate three well-established mathematical models describing interactions\nbetween tumour cells and immune elements. These case studies were\nre-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and also converted to the\nGillespie algorithm formulation. Our interest in this work, therefore, is to\nestablish a methodological discussion regarding the usability of different\nsimulation approaches, rather than provide further biological insights into the\ninvestigated case studies. Our results show that it is possible to obtain\nequivalent models that implement the same mechanisms; however, the incapacity\nof the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects\nthe similarity of some results. Furthermore, the emergent behaviour of ABMS\nproduces extra patters of behaviour in the system, which was not obtained by\nthe Gillespie algorithm.",

    "summary": "Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for\npractical large-scale equilibrium computation in incomplete-information games.\nHowever, imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood, and only weak\nalgorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known. In this paper, we\nshow the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for\nNash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in\nimperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original\n(perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes\nthe only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions where any\nresults had been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each\nof which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error\nbound.\n  We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties,\nthe problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of\nthe game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is\nthe distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall\nabstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide\nin the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all\ninformation sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space.\nConversely, if this condition is not satisfied, we show that the input does not\nform a metric space.

    "summary": "One important challenge for a set of agents to achieve more efficient\ncollaboration is for these agents to maintain proper models of each other. An\nimportant aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial\nand incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models:\nMDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many\napplications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt.\nWhile it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for\nlearning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability\nmodels, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning\ncapability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning,\nand the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan\nexecution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of\nincompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP\nbased and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\\em\nabstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability\nmodels are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g.,\nrobot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore,\nwhen used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately),\ncapability models provide flexible abstraction of actions.

    "summary": "In many situations a player may act so as to maximize a perceived utility\nthat does not coincide with the objective of the system analyst or designer.\nSuch discrepancies may arise due to rational factors (such as tolls or\nrestricted budgets), or due to cognitive biases such as those that are common\nin behavioral economics: risk attitudes, altruism, present-bias and so on. When\nanalyzing a game, one may ask how inefficiency, as measured by the Price of\nAnarchy (PoA), is affected by the perceived utilities. This question is\nespecially challenging in the presence of heterogeneous biases, where each\nplayer essentially plays a different game. The smoothness method [Roughgarden\n'04,'09] naturally extends to games with homogeneous perceived utilities or\ncosts, regardless of the game or the behavioral bias. We show that such\nbiased-smoothness is broadly applicable in the context of nonatomic congestion\ngames: In games with arbitrary heterogeneous biases, we bound the agents'\nequilibrium costs purely based on their own biased-smoothness parameters, as\nwell as on structural parameters of the underlying network. For symmetric\nheterogeneous games, we provide a {\\em biased PoA} bound that depends on the\naverage biased-smoothness of all participating types. We complement our\npositive results with examples showing tightness or almost-tightness of the\nupper bounds. We also identify various classes of cost functions and biases\nthat are biased-smooth, thereby substantially improving some recent results\nfrom the literature.",

    "summary": "Inspired by cognitive radio networks, we consider a setting where multiple\nusers share several channels modeled as a multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB)\nproblem. The characteristics of each channel are unknown and are different for\neach user. Each user can choose between the channels, but her success depends\non the particular channel chosen as well as on the selections of other users:\nif two users select the same channel their messages collide and none of them\nmanages to send any data. Our setting is fully distributed, so there is no\ncentral control. As in many communication systems, the users cannot set up a\ndirect communication protocol, so information exchange must be limited to a\nminimum. We develop an algorithm for learning a stable configuration for the\nmulti-user MAB problem. We further offer both convergence guarantees and\nexperiments inspired by real communication networks, including comparison to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "summary": "Bribery in elections is an important problem in computational social choice\ntheory. However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent\ncomputational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to\ncapture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber\nis frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a\ncertain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the\ngoal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only\nvulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes\nhave prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by\nchanging only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber.\nWe further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem\nnamely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery\nwhere the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or\ndifferent.\n  We study the computational complexity of the above problems for unweighted\nand weighted elections for several commonly used voting rules. We observe that,\neven if we have only a small number of candidates, the problems are intractable\nfor all voting rules studied here for weighted elections, with the sole\nexception of the Frugal-bribery problem for the plurality voting rule. In\ncontrast, we have polynomial time algorithms for the Frugal-bribery problem for\nplurality, veto, k-approval, k-veto, and plurality with runoff voting rules for\nunweighted elections. However, the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem is\nintractable for all the voting rules studied here barring the plurality and the\nveto voting rules for unweighted elections.",

    "summary": "The Coalitional Manipulation (CM) problem has been studied extensively in the\nliterature for many voting rules. The CM problem, however, has been studied\nonly in the complete information setting, that is, when the manipulators know\nthe votes of the non-manipulators. A more realistic scenario is an incomplete\ninformation setting where the manipulators do not know the exact votes of the\nnon- manipulators but may have some partial knowledge of the votes. In this\npaper, we study a setting where the manipulators know a partial order for each\nvoter that is consistent with the vote of that voter. In this setting, we\nintroduce and study two natural computational problems - (1) Weak Manipulation\n(WM) problem where the manipulators wish to vote in a way that makes their\npreferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of the\nnon-manipulators; (2) Strong Manipulation (SM) problem where the manipulators\nwish to vote in a way that makes their preferred candidate win in all possible\nextensions of the partial votes of the non-manipulators. We study the\ncomputational complexity of the WM and the SM problems for commonly used voting\nrules such as plurality, veto, k-approval, k-veto, maximin, Copeland, and\nBucklin.

    "summary": "A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a cooperative engagement of a collection of\nmobile nodes without any centralized access point or infrastructure to\ncoordinate among the peers. The underlying concept of coordination among nodes\nin a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to\nissues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network\ntopology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management\npoint, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed\napproach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that\ncombines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a\nMANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior,\nhence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture\nas the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally\nnor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self\nobservation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need\nof a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense\nthat it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path\nManager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our\nsystem outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing\noverhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious.\nVarious parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update\nvalues, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over\nseveral simulation test runs of the system. By combining the semi-distributed\narchitecture and other design essentials like path manager, monitor module,\nredemption and fading concepts; Our system proves to be robust enough to\ncounter most common attacks in MANETs.",

    "summary": "Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and\nsocieties. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale\ndifference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed\nmicro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This\npaper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local\nspread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease\nbetween regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the\nspread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the\nspread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global\nspread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the\nlocal spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a\nsimulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available\ndata on population, population density, and traffic networks between different\nregions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global\ntraffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results\nshow that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly\nimprove the results of modeling disease spread.",

    "summary": "In our previous work [1], a divide-and-conquer approach was proposed for\ncooperative tasking among multi-agent systems. The basic idea is to decompose a\nrequested global specification into subtasks for individual agents such that\nthe fulfillment of these subtasks by each individual agent leads to the\nsatisfaction of the global specification as a team. It was shown that not all\ntasks can be decomposed. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition was\nproposed for the decomposability of a task automaton between two cooperative\nagents. The current paper continues the results in [1] and proposes necessary\nand sufficient conditions for task decomposability with respect to arbitrary\nfinite number of agents. It is further shown that the fulfillment of local\nspecifications can guarantee the satisfaction of the global specification. This\nwork provides hints for the designers on how to rule out the indecomposable\ntask automata and enforce the decomposability conditions. The result therefore\nmay pave the way towards a new perspective for decentralized cooperative\ncontrol of multi-agent systems.",

However, up until now, the latter has\nalways been implemented on the CPU. In this paper, we discuss several\nparallelisation strategies for both stages of the ACO algorithm on the GPU.

For the control center, we propose\nparallel cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithms (one for each region) to detect\nanomalies from noisy observations. For the vehicles, we propose a stochastic\nrouting policy, in which the regions to be visited are chosen according to a\nprobability vector. We study stationary routing policy (the probability vector\nis constant) as well as adaptive routing policies (the probability vector\nvaries in time as a function of the likelihood of regional anomalies). In the\ncontext of stationary policies, we design a performance metric and minimize it\nto design an efficient stationary routing policy. Our adaptive policy improves\nupon the stationary counterpart by adaptively increasing the selection\nprobability of regions with high likelihood of anomaly. Finally, we show the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations and a\npersistent surveillance experiment.",

    "summary": "Classical approaches for asymptotic convergence to the global average in a\ndistributed fashion typically assume timely and reliable exchange of\ninformation between neighboring components of a given multi-component system.\nThese assumptions are not necessarily valid in practical settings due to\nvarying delays that might affect transmissions at different times, as well as\npossible changes in the underlying interconnection topology (e.g., due to\ncomponent mobility). In this work, we propose protocols to overcome these\nlimitations. We first consider a fixed interconnection topology (captured by a\n- possibly directed - graph) and propose a discrete-time protocol that can\nreach asymptotic average consensus in a distributed fashion, despite the\npresence of arbitrary (but bounded) delays in the communication links. The\nprotocol requires that each component has knowledge of the number of its\noutgoing links (i.e., the number of components to which it sends information).\nWe subsequently extend the protocol to also handle changes in the underlying\ninterconnection topology and describe a variety of rather loose conditions\nunder which the modified protocol allows the components to reach asymptotic\naverage consensus. The proposed algorithms are illustrated via examples.",

    "summary": "Congestion games model a wide variety of real-world resource congestion\nproblems, such as selfish network routing, traffic route guidance in congested\nareas, taxi fleet optimization and crowd movement in busy areas. However,\nexisting research in congestion games assumes: (a) deterministic movement of\nagents between resources; and (b) perfect rationality (i.e. maximizing their\nown expected value) of all agents. Such assumptions are not reasonable in\ndynamic domains where decision support has to be provided to humans. For\ninstance, in optimizing the performance of a taxi fleet serving a city,\nmovement of taxis can be involuntary or nondeterministic (decided by the\nspecific customer who hires the taxi) and more importantly, taxi drivers may\nnot follow advice provided by the decision support system (due to bounded\nrationality of humans). To that end, we contribute: (a) a general framework for\nrepresenting congestion games under uncertainty for populations with assorted\nnotions of rationality. (b) a scalable approach for solving the decision\nproblem for perfectly rational agents which are in the mix with boundedly\nrational agents; and (c) a detailed evaluation on a synthetic and realworld\ndata set to illustrate the usefulness of our new approach with respect to key\nsocial welfare metrics in the context of an assorted human-agent population. An\ninteresting result from our experiments on a real-world taxi fleet optimization\nproblem is that it is better (in terms of revenue and operational efficiency)\nfor taxi drivers to follow perfectly rational strategies irrespective of the\npercentage of drivers not following the advice.",

Due to the\nvulnerable nature of wireless communication against interference and\nintentional jamming, ITS face new challenges to ensure the reliability and the\nsafety of the overall system. In this paper, we expose a class of stealthy\nattacks -- Stuck in Traffic (SiT) attacks -- that aim to cause congestion by\nexploiting how drivers make decisions based on smart traffic signs. An attacker\nmounting a SiT attack solves a Markov Decision Process problem to find\noptimal/suboptimal attack policies in which he/she interferes with a\nwell-chosen subset of signals that are based on the state of the system. We\napply Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms to derive potent attack\npolicies.

    "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the interactions among oligarchs, political\nparties, and voters using an agent-based modeling approach. We introduce the\nOLIGO model, which is based on the spatial model of democracy, where voters\nhave positions in a policy space and vote for the party that appears closest to\nthem, and parties move in policy space to seek more votes. We extend the\nexisting literature on agent-based models of political economy in the following\nmanner: (1) by introducing a new class of agents- oligarchs - that represent\nleaders of firms in a common industry who lobby for beneficial subsidies\nthrough campaign donations; and (2) by investigating the effects of ideological\npreferences of the oligarchs on legislative action. We test hypotheses from the\nliterature in political economics on the behavior of oligarchs and political\nparties as they interact, under conditions of imperfect information and bounded\nrationality. Our key results indicate that (1) oligarchs tend to donate less to\npolitical campaigns when the parties are more resistant to changing their\npolicies, or when voters are more informed; and (2) if Oligarchs donate to\nparties based on a combination of ideological and profit motivations, Oligarchs\nwill tend to donate at a lower equilibrium level, due to the influence of lost\nprofits. We validate these outcomes via comparisons to real world polling data\non changes in party support over time.",

    "summary": "Crowd simulation is rapidly becoming a standard tool for evacuation planning\nand evaluation. However, the many crowd models in the literature are\nstructurally different, and few have been rigorously calibrated against\nreal-world egress data, especially in emergency situations. In this paper we\ndescribe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or\nbetween models and real-world data. We simulated three models: (1) the lattice\ngas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the\ndistributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation\ntime, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and\n(6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise\nmatrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three\nmodels onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we\nfind the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation\ntime, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models\nare similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find\nthat the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from\neach other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the\nkey test between different models, and also between models and the real world.\nFinally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency\nevacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force\nmodel agrees best with this real data.",

    "summary": "Several multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been\nproposed to optimize agents decisions. Due to the complexity of the problem,\nthe majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either\nhad some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or\nobserved other agents actions and the rewards they received.\n  We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL),\nwhich allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark\n2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an\nagent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents\nactions or rewards). Furthermore, WPL does not assume that agents know the\nunderlying game or the corresponding Nash Equilibrium a priori. We\nexperimentally show that our algorithm converges in benchmark\ntwo-player-two-action games. We also show that our algorithm converges in the\nchallenging Shapleys game where previous MARL algorithms failed to converge\nwithout knowing the underlying game or the NE. Furthermore, we show that WPL\noutperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100\nagents interacting and learning concurrently.\n  An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is\nanalyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning\nagents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis\nnot only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually\nconverge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to\nconvergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show\nthat symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the\nnon-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had\neither linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs\ndynamics differential equations and compare the solution to the dynamics of\nprevious MARL algorithms.",

    "title": "An Anytime Algorithm for Optimal Coalition Structure Generation", 
    "publish": "2014-01-15T05:23:56Z", 
    "summary": "Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the\ncreation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to\nefficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective\ncoalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.\nCentral to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many\npossible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually\nrequires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the\ncoalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it\nwas formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a\ncombination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one\ncoalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.\nHowever, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging\ndue to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows\nexponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many\nalgorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques\nranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search\nall of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution\nquality, and memory requirements.\n  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition\nstructure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel\nrepresentation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible\nsolutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower\nbounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are\nthen used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the\noptimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches\nthrough the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound\ntechnique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).\nIn this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition\nstructures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions\nautomatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop\na new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable\nbenchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.\nGiven this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able\nto find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the\nfastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if\ninterrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a\nsolution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.\nMoreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are\nsignificantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art\nalgorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case\ndistribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient\nsolution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.",

    "summary": "Because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take, it\nshould plan which resources it holds over time carefully, considering its\ninherent limitations (such as power or payload restrictions), the competing\nneeds of other agents for the same resources, and the stochastic nature of the\nenvironment. Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if\nthey can use --- and even create --- opportunities to change which resources\nthey hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could\nbreak their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally\nreconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned\nresources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.\nIn this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential\noptimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We\npresent a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of\nthis problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined)\naccounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our\nformulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at\neach phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each\nphase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them\nto find solutions significantly faster(orders of magnitude faster in larger\nproblems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically.",

    "summary": "Weighted voting is a classic model of cooperation among agents in\ndecision-making domains. In such games, each player has a weight, and a\ncoalition of players wins the game if its total weight meets or exceeds a given\nquota. A players power in such games is usually not directly proportional to\nhis weight, and is measured by a power index, the most prominent among which\nare the Shapley-Shubik index and the Banzhaf index.In this paper, we\ninvestigate by how much a player can change his power, as measured by the\nShapley-Shubik index or the Banzhaf index, by means of a false-name\nmanipulation, i.e., splitting his weight among two or more identities. For both\nindices, we provide upper and lower bounds on the effect of weight-splitting.\nWe then show that checking whether a beneficial split exists is NP-hard, and\ndiscuss efficient algorithms for restricted cases of this problem, as well as\nrandomized algorithms for the general case.

However, in some cases it is impractical for an agent to give a linear\norder over all the alternatives. It has been suggested to let agents submit\npartial orders instead.

These are the\npossible winner and necessary winner problems, respectively. Each of these two\nproblems is further divided into two sub-problems: determining whether c is a\nunique winner (that is, c is the only winner), or determining whether c is a\nco-winner (that is, c is in the set of winners). We consider the setting where\nthe number of alternatives is unbounded and the votes are unweighted.

When facing a strong adversary that knows the patrol\nstrategy of the robots, if the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm,\nthen in many cases it is easy for the adversary to penetrate undetected (in\nfact, in some of those cases the adversary can guarantee penetration).\nTherefore this paper presents a non-deterministic patrol framework for the\nrobots. Assuming that the strong adversary will take advantage of its knowledge\nand try to penetrate through the patrols weakest spot, hence an optimal\nalgorithm is one that maximizes the chances of detection in that point. We\ntherefore present a polynomial-time algorithm for determining an optimal patrol\nunder the Markovian strategy assumption for the robots, such that the\nprobability of detecting the adversary in the patrols weakest spot is\nmaximized. We build upon this framework and describe an optimal patrol strategy\nfor several robotic models based on their movement abilities (directed or\nundirected) and sensing abilities (perfect or imperfect), and in different\nenvironment models - either patrol around a perimeter (closed polygon) or an\nopen fence (open polyline).",

However, most effort to date has\nconcentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groups\nof people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on modeling actual successful\nexecutions (and not failed or attempted executions) of the activities of\ninterest. We, in contrast, take on the task of understanding human\ninteractions, attempted interactions, and intentions from noisy sensor data in\na fully relational multi-agent setting. We use a real-world game of capture the\nflag to illustrate our approach in a well-defined domain that involves many\ndistinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain\nusing Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that\njointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such\nas a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposed\nby the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the\nrules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound\nfashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a\nmulti-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the\nactivity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future\nbehaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded\nit. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent\nactivities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same\nactivities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable\nof recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions with\nhigh accuracy.

To tackle this problem, it is possible\n(i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a\nnetwork, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at\nspecific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of\nthe existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart\ntransportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising\nfield of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular,\nmultiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and\nimplementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous\nagents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby\ngenerating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system\nand maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms\nfor the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.\n  In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the\nmanagement of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous\nvehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact\nwith the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the\nroad network.

Motivated by this, we initiate the\nstudy of detection of possible manipulators in an election.\n  We formulate two pertinent computational problems - Coalitional Possible\nManipulators (CPM) and Coalitional Possible Manipulators given Winner (CPMW),\nwhere a suspect group of voters is provided as input to compute whether they\ncan be a potential coalition of possible manipulators. In the absence of any\nsuspect group, we formulate two more computational problems namely Coalitional\nPossible Manipulators Search (CPMS), and Coalitional Possible Manipulators\nSearch given Winner (CPMSW). We provide polynomial time algorithms for these\nproblems, for several popular voting rules. For a few other voting rules, we\nshow that these problems are in NP-complete. We observe that detecting\nmanipulation maybe easy even when manipulation is hard, as seen for example, in\nthe case of the Borda voting rule.",

    "summary": "In a party-based election system, the voters are grouped into parties and all\nvoters of a party are assumed to vote according to the party preferences over\nthe candidates. Hence, once the party preferences are declared the outcome of\nthe election can be determined. However, in the actual election, the members of\nsome \"instable\" parties often leave their own party to join other parties. We\nintroduce two parameters to measure the credibility of the prediction based on\nparty preferences: Min is the minimum number of voters leaving the instable\nparties such that the prediction is no longer true, while Max is the maximum\nnumber of voters leaving the instable parties such that the prediction remains\nvalid. Concerning the complexity of computing Min and Max, we consider both\npositional scoring rules (Plurality, Veto, r-Approval and Borda) and\nCondorcet-consistent rules (Copeland and Maximin). We show that for all\nconsidered scoring rules, Min is polynomial-time computable, while it is\nNP-hard to compute Min for Copeland and Maximin. With the only exception of\nBorda, Max can be computed in polynomial time for other scoring rules. We have\nNP-hardness results for the computation of Max under Borda, Maximin and\nCopeland.",

    "summary": "Research on multi-agent planning has been popular in recent years. While\nprevious research has been motivated by the understanding that, through\ncooperation, multi-agent systems can achieve tasks that are unachievable by\nsingle-agent systems, there are no formal characterizations of situations where\ncooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of\nmulti-agent systems. In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from\nthe planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required\ncooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that\nrequire cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems\nwith heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the\nconditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none\nof these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.\nFurthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum\nnumber of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study\nnot only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many\napplications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve\na task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be\ninformed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a\nsolution.",

The amalgamation of these traits is then used to\nconfigure the intuitive notion of social intelligence. Instead, in this paper\nwe start from a parametrised definition of social intelligence as the expected\nperformance in a set of environments with several agents, and we assess and\nderive tests from it. This definition makes several dependencies explicit: (1)\nthe definition depends on the choice (and weight) of environments and agents,\n(2) the definition may include both competitive and cooperative behaviours\ndepending on how agents and rewards are arranged into teams, (3) the definition\nmostly depends on the abilities of other agents, and (4) the actual difference\nbetween social intelligence and general intelligence (or other abilities)\ndepends on these choices. As a result, we address the problem of converting\nthis definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties\nensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and\nanticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some\nother more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry,\nvalidity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the\ndefinition into a practical test.

Instead, we perform sequential path planning by\nconsidering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as\ntime-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a\ndouble-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined\nas the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying\nwithin a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the\ndouble-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the\noptimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of the\ndouble-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics,\ntarget sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexity\nthat scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehicles\nin consideration.",

    "summary": "In this paper, the problem of bridge consensus is presented and solved.\nBridge consensus consists of a network of nodes, some of whom are participating\nand others are non-participating. The objective is for all the agents to reach\naverage consensus of the participating nodes initial values in a distributed\nand scalable manner. To do this, the nodes must use the network connections of\nthe non-participating nodes, which act as bridges for information and ignore\nthe initial values of the non-participating nodes. The solution to this problem\nis made by merging the ideas from estimation theory and consensus theory. By\nconsidering the participating nodes has having equal information and the\nnon-participating nodes as having no information, the nodes initial values are\ntransformed into information space. Two consensus filters are run in parallel\non the information state and information matrix. Conditions ensuring that the\nproduct of the inverse information matrix and the information state of each\nagent reaches average consensus of the participating agents' initial values is\ngiven.",

    "summary": "Predicting the winner of an election is a favorite problem both for news\nmedia pundits and computational social choice theorists. Since it is often\ninfeasible to elicit the preferences of all the voters in a typical prediction\nscenario, a common algorithm used for winner prediction is to run the election\non a small sample of randomly chosen votes and output the winner as the\nprediction. We analyze the performance of this algorithm for many common voting\nrules.\n  More formally, we introduce the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-winner determination\nproblem, where given an election on $n$ voters and $m$ candidates in which the\nmargin of victory is at least $\\epsilon n$ votes, the goal is to determine the\nwinner with probability at least $1-\\delta$. The margin of victory of an\nelection is the smallest number of votes that need to be modified in order to\nchange the election winner. We show interesting lower and upper bounds on the\nnumber of samples needed to solve the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-winner determination\nproblem for many common voting rules, including scoring rules, approval,\nmaximin, Copeland, Bucklin, plurality with runoff, and single transferable\nvote. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds match for many common voting rules\nin a wide range of practically appealing scenarios.",

    "summary": "By an undirected rigid formation of mobile autonomous agents is meant a\nformation based on graph rigidity in which each pair of \"neighboring\" agents is\nresponsible for maintaining a prescribed target distance between them. In a\nrecent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control\nlaws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected\nformations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by\nkinematic point models. The aim of this paper is to explain what happens to\nsuch formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of\nwhat the desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if\nneighboring agents have differing estimates of what the actual distance between\nthem is. In either case, what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of\nthe formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed\ndistances increase. While this is observed for the gradient laws in question,\nsomething else quite unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for\nany rigidity-based, undirected formation of this type which is comprised of\nthree or more agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different\nunderstandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to be,\nthen almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid\nformation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in\ntwo-dimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular\nspeed.",

Each local FTC scheme consists of a fault\ndiagnosis module and a reconfigurable controller module comprised of a baseline\ncontroller and two adaptive fault-tolerant controllers activated after fault\ndetection and after fault isolation, respectively. Under certain assumptions,\nthe closed-loop system's stability and leader-follower consensus properties are\nrigorously established under different modes of the FTC system, including the\ntime-period before possible fault detection, between fault detection and\npossible isolation, and after fault isolation.",

    "summary": "Given a connected region in two-dimensional space where events of a certain\nkind occur according to a certain time-varying density, we consider the problem\nof setting up a network of autonomous mobile agents to detect the occurrence of\nthose events and possibly record them in as effective a manner as possible. We\nassume that agents can communicate with one another wirelessly within a fixed\ncommunication radius, and moreover that initially no agent has any information\nregarding the event density. We introduce a new distributed algorithm for agent\ncontrol based on the notion of an execution mode, which essentially lets each\nagent roam the target region either at random or following its local view of a\ndensity-dependent gradient. Agents can switch back and forth between the two\nmodes, and the precise manner of such changes depends on the setting of various\nparameters that can be adjusted as a function of the application at hand. We\nprovide simulation results on some synthetic applications especially designed\nto highlight the algorithm's behavior relative to the possible execution modes.",

An ICN is considered a system that\ncontains a variety of interconnected industrial equipments, such as physical\ncontrol processes, control systems, computers, and communication networks. It\nis built to supervise and control industrial processes. This paper presents a\ndevelopment case study on building a multi-layered agent-based ICN in which\nagents cooperate to provide an effective supervision and control of a set of\ncontrol processes, basically controlled by a set of legacy control systems with\nlimited computing capabilities. The proposed ICN is designed to add an\nintelligent layer on top of legacy control systems to compensate their limited\ncapabilities using a cost-effective agent-based approach, and also to provide\nglobal synchronization and safety plans. It is tested and evaluated within a\nsimulation environment. The main conclusion of this research is that agents and\nMAS can provide an effective, flexible, and cost-effective solution to handle\nthe emerged limitations of legacy control systems if they are properly\nintegrated with these systems.",

    "publish": "2015-08-21T16:30:25Z", 
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multi-agent systems,\nespecially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as\nexponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes\nit difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a\nnovel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)\nis presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL\nalgorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for\nagents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile\n(non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented\nNegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for\nsparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum\nvariance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of\nlocal Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared\nvalue functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to\nachieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational\ncomplexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI\nalgorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:\nsteps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime\n(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games\nand shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.\nThen in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent\nwarehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms.",

The modeling involves the construction of a computational\nalgorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and\ngovernments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real\nestate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher\nquality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods\nmarket allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by\nprice and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms\n(location) and candidates (qualification). The government may be configured\ninto one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments.

Initially, the robots form a closed chain on\nthe grid and must keep this connectivity during the whole process of their\ngathering. Connectivity means, that neighboring robots of the chain need to be\npositioned at the same or neighboring points of the grid. In our model,\ngathering means to keep shortening the chain until the robots are located\ninside a $2\\times 2$ subgrid. Our model is completely local (no global control,\nno global coordinates, no compass, no global communication or vision, \\ldots).\nEach robot can only see its next constant number of left and right neighbors on\nthe chain. This fixed constant is called the \\emph{viewing path length}. All\nits operations and detections are restricted to this constant number of robots.\nOther robots, even if located at neighboring or the same grid point cannot be\ndetected. Only based on the relative positions of its detectable chain\nneighbors, a robot can decide to obtain a certain state. Based on this state\nand their local knowledge, the robots do local modifications to the chain by\nmoving to neighboring grid points without breaking the chain. These\nmodifications are performed without the knowledge whether they lead to a global\nprogress or not. We assume the fully synchronous $\\mathcal{FSYNC}$ model.

We show that this decision problem is equivalent to finding the\nshortest path on an \"extended\" transportation graph, with virtual arcs that\nrepresent charging options. Using this extended graph, we study the collective\neffects of a large number of EV owners individually solving this path planning\nproblem. We propose a scheme in which independent power and transportation\nsystem operators can collaborate to manage each network towards a socially\noptimum operating point while keeping the operational data of each system\nprivate. We further study the optimal reserve capacity requirements for pricing\nin the absence of such collaboration. We showcase numerically that a lack of\nattention to interdependencies between the two infrastructures can have adverse\noperational effects.",

A recent body of work, however, has\nshown that many of the NP-hardness shields, previously obtained, vanish when\nthe electorate has single-peaked or nearly single-peaked preferences.

    "summary": "We target the problem of controlling electrical microgrids with little\ninertia in real time. We consider a central controller and a number of\nresources, where each resource is either a load, a generator, or a combination\nthereof, like a battery. The controller periodically computes power setpoints\nfor the resources based on the estimated state of the grid and an overall\nobjective, and subject to safety constraints. Each resource is augmented with a\nresource agent that a) implements the setpoint requests sent by the controller\non the resource, and b) translates device-specific information about the\nresource into a device-independent representation and transmits this to the\ncontroller.\n  We focus on the resource agents and their impact on the overall system's\nbehavior. Intuitively, for the system to converge to the objective, the\nresource agents should be obedient to the requests from the controller, in the\nsense that the actually implemented setpoint should be close to the requested\nsetpoint, at least on average. This can be important especially when a\ncontroller that performs continuous optimization is used (for the sake of\nperformance) to control discrete resources (which have a discrete set of\nimplementable setpoints).\n  We formalize obedience by defining the notion of $c$-bounded\naccumulated-error. We then demonstrate its usefulness, by presenting\ntheoretical results (for a simple scenario) and simulation results (for a more\nrealistic setting) that indicate that, if all resource agents in the system\nhave bounded accumulated-error, the closed-loop system converges on average to\nthe objective. Finally, we show how to design resource agents that provably\nhave bounded accumulated-error for various types of resources, such as\nresources with uncertainty (e.g., PV panels) and resources with a discrete set\nof implementable setpoints (e.g., on-off heating systems).",

We present an\napproach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems,\nexploiting a property that can be thought of as \"anonymous influence\" in the\nfactored MDP. Anonymous influence summarizes joint variable effects efficiently\nwhenever the explicit representation of variable identity in the problem can be\navoided. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into\ncomputational efficiencies, both for general variable elimination in a factor\ngraph but in particular also for the approximate linear programming solution to\nfactored MDPs.

Given an arbitrarily distributed (yet connected)\nswarm of robots, the gathering problem on the grid is to locate all robots\nwithin a $2\\times 2$-sized area that is not known beforehand. Two robots are\nconnected if they are vertical or horizontal neighbors on the grid. The\nlocality constraint means that no global control, no compass, no global\ncommunication and only local vision is available; hence, a robot can only see\nits grid neighbors up to a constant $L_1$-distance, which also limits its\nmovements. A robot can move to one of its eight neighboring grid cells and if\ntwo or more robots move to the same location they are \\emph{merged} to be only\none robot. The locality constraint is the significant challenging issue here,\nsince robot movements must not harm the (only globally checkable) swarm\nconnectivity. For solving the gathering problem, we provide a synchronous\nalgorithm -- executed by every robot -- which ensures that robots merge without\nbreaking the swarm connectivity. In our model, robots can obtain a special\nstate, which marks such a robot to be performing specific connectivity\npreserving movements in order to allow later merge operations of the swarm.\nCompared to the grid, for gathering in the Euclidean plane for the same robot\nand time model the best known upper bound is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.",

This work investigates the causes of group formation when these\nexternal factors are not present and individuals compete for the same\nresources, i.e. within-group competition.\n  A motivating example for our research is a recent anthropological study that\nfound evidence for an increase in social tolerance among Homo Sapiens starting\nfrom the Middle Pleistocene. Social tolerance is a prerequisite for the\ncreation of large social groups that include unrelated individuals, but at the\nsame time it becomes evolutionarily successful only if interactions with\nunrelated individuals are frequent.\n  We argue that lack of information about resource location could have induced\nfrequent interactions between unrelated individuals, as it would enable\ncollective sensing and provide an evolutionary advantage. Collective sensing\nrefers to the ability of a group to sense what is beyond the capabilities of\nthe individual. Collective sensing is present in nature but its role in group\nformation has never been studied.\n  We test our hypothesis by means of an agent-based evolutionary model of a\nforaging task, with which we compare the fitness individuals using different\nnavigation strategies: random walk and herding behavior, i.e. moving towards\ncrowded areas. Although agents are unable to perceive resources at the\nindividual level, interactions between them allow the group of herding agents\nto collectively locate resources.\n  Our findings suggest that evolution favors the spontaneous formation of\ngroups, if resources become scarce and information about their location is not\navailable at the individual level but can be inferred from the dynamics of the\npopulation.",

For the air highway placement problem, the fast marching method is\nused to produce a sequence of air highways that minimizes the cost of flying\nfrom an origin to any destination. The placement of air highways can be updated\nin real-time to accommodate sudden airspace changes. Within platoons traveling\non air highways, each vehicle is modeled as a hybrid system. Using\nHamilton-Jacobi reachability, safety and goal satisfaction are guaranteed for\nall mode transitions. For a single altitude range, the proposed approach\nguarantees safety for one safety breach per vehicle, in the unlikely event of\nmultiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over multiple altitude\nranges.

    "summary": "This paper introduces two objective functions for computing the expected cost\nin the Stochastic Collection and Replenishment (SCAR) scenario. In the SCAR\nscenario, multiple user agents have a limited supply of a resource that they\neither use or collect, depending on the scenario. To enable persistent\nautonomy, dedicated replenishment agents travel to the user agents and\nreplenish or collect their supply of the resource, thus allowing them to\noperate indefinitely in the field. Of the two objective functions, one uses a\nMonte Carlo method, while the other uses a significantly faster analytical\nmethod. Approximations to multiplication, division and inversion of Gaussian\ndistributed variables are used to facilitate propagation of probability\ndistributions in the analytical method when Gaussian distributed parameters are\nused. The analytical objective function is shown to have greater than 99%\ncomparison accuracy when compared with the Monte Carlo objective function while\nachieving speed gains of several orders of magnitude.",

The problem is framed as a combinatorial\noptimisation problem, and A* is used to find the optimal schedule. Through a\ncomputational study, a ratio objective function is shown to have superior\nperformance compared with a total weighted tardiness objective function, with a\ngreater performance advantage present when using shorter schedule lengths. The\nimportance of incorporating uncertainty in the objective function used in the\noptimisation process is also highlighted, in particular for scenarios in which\nthe replenishment agent is under- or fully-utilised.",

    "summary": "Multi-agent differential games are important and useful tools for analyzing\nmany practical problems. With the recent surge of interest in using UAVs for\ncivil purposes, the importance and urgency of developing tractable multi-agent\nanalysis techniques that provide safety and performance guarantees is at an\nall-time high. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability has successfully provided\nsafety guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of system\ndynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachability\nprevents its direct application to large scale problems when the number of\nvehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we overcome the scalability\nlimitations of HJ reachability by using a mixed integer program that exploits\nthe properties of HJ solutions to provide higher-level control logic. Our\nproposed method provides safety guarantee for three-vehicle systems -- a\npreviously intractable task for HJ reachability -- without incurring\nsignificant additional computation cost. Furthermore, our method is scalable\nbeyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics than\nan extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collision\navoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations.",

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)\nreachability is ideal for analyzing such safety-critical systems because it\nprovides safety guarantees and is flexible in terms of system dynamics,\nhowever, its direct application is limited to small-scale systems typically of\nno more than two vehicles because of the exponentially-scaling computation\ncomplexity. Previously, the sequential path planning (SPP) method, which\nassigns strict priorities to vehicles, was proposed, SPP allows multi-vehicle\npath planning to be done with a linearly-scaling computation complexity.\nHowever, the previous SPP formulation assumed that there are no disturbances in\nthe vehicle dynamics, and that every vehicle has perfect knowledge of the\nposition of higher-priority vehicles. In this paper, we make SPP more practical\nby providing three different methods to account for disturbances in dynamics\nand imperfect knowledge of higher-priority vehicles' states.

    "summary": "This article analyzes two classes of job selection policies that control how\na network of autonomous aerial vehicles delivers goods from depots to\ncustomers. Customer requests (jobs) occur according to a spatio-temporal\nstochastic process not known by the system. If job selection uses a policy in\nwhich the first job (FJ) is served first, the system may collapse to\ninstability by removing just one vehicle. Policies that serve the nearest job\n(NJ) first show such threshold behavior only in some settings and can be\nimplemented in a distributed manner. The timing of job selection has\nsignificant impact on delivery time and stability for NJ while it has no impact\nfor FJ. Based on these findings we introduce a methodological approach for\ndecision- making support to set up and operate such a system, taking into\naccount the trade-off between monetary cost and service quality. In particular,\nwe compute a lower bound for the infrastructure expenditure required to achieve\na certain expected delivery time. The approach includes three time horizons:\nlong-term decisions on the number of depots to deploy in the service area, mid-\nterm decisions on the number of vehicles to use, and short-term decisions on\nthe policy to operate the vehicles.",

In this paper we\nidentify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or\ncoalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a\nconsequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in\npolynomial time.

Specific contributions include a method for calculating the\nprobability of a set of independent normally distributed random events\noccurring in a given order, an upper bound on that probability, and a method\nfor calculating the most likely and $n$-th most likely orders of occurrence for\na set of independent normally distributed random events that have equal\nstandard deviations. The complete framework is shown to be much faster than a\nMonte Carlo approach for the same accuracy in two multi-robot task allocation\nproblems. This is a general framework that is agnostic to the optimisation\nmethod and objective function used, and is applicable to a wide range of\nrobotics and non-robotics problems.",

    "publish": "2016-07-17T15:32:29Z", 
    "summary": "We present a model for controlling swarms of mobile agents via broadcast\ncontrol, assumed to be detected by a random set of agents in the swarm. The\nagents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The\nagents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less\nunits with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is\nprogrammed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on\nthe relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control,\nwhich is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local\ngathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as\nthe visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters\nand a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each\ntime-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and\nall the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of\npairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of\nthe influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete.\nThese results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the\nvisibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient\nconditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show\nthat if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control\nsignal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the\ngraph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology,\ncould not be found.",

    "summary": "A framework for consensus modelling is introduced using Kleene's three valued\nlogic as a means to express vagueness in agents' beliefs. Explicitly borderline\ncases are inherent to propositions involving vague concepts where sentences of\na propositional language may be absolutely true, absolutely false or\nborderline. By exploiting these intermediate truth values, we can allow agents\nto adopt a more vague interpretation of underlying concepts in order to weaken\ntheir beliefs and reduce the levels of inconsistency, so as to achieve\nconsensus. We consider a consensus combination operation which results in\nagents adopting the borderline truth value as a shared viewpoint if they are in\ndirect conflict. Simulation experiments are presented which show that applying\nthis operator to agents chosen at random (subject to a consistency threshold)\nfrom a population, with initially diverse opinions, results in convergence to a\nsmaller set of more precise shared beliefs. Furthermore, if the choice of\nagents for combination is dependent on the payoff of their beliefs, this acting\nas a proxy for performance or usefulness, then the system converges to beliefs\nwhich, on average, have higher payoff.",

Besides clinical and\nmathematical tools, we believe there is opportunity to further exploit\nsimulation tools to understand immunosenescence.

The objective is to maximize expected\nutilization, while insisting on dominant-strategy equilibria, individual\nrationality, and no-deficit.

    "summary": "Consider a situation with $n$ agents or players where some of the players\nform a coalition with a certain collective objective. Simple games are used to\nmodel systems that can decide whether coalitions are successful (winning) or\nnot (losing). A simple game can be viewed as a monotone boolean function. The\ndimension of a simple game is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that the\nsimple game can be expressed as the intersection of $d$ threshold functions\nwhere each threshold function uses a threshold and $n$ weights. Taylor and\nZwicker have shown that $d$ is bounded from above by the number of maximal\nlosing coalitions. We present two new upper bounds both containing the\nTaylor/Zwicker-bound as a special case. The Taylor/Zwicker-bound imply an upper\nbound of ${n \\choose n/2}$. We improve this upper bound significantly by\nshowing constructively that $d$ is bounded from above by the cardinality of any\nbinary covering code with length $n$ and covering radius $1$. This result\nsupplements a recent result where Olsen et al. showed how to construct simple\ngames with dimension $|C|$ for any binary constant weight SECDED code $C$ with\nlength $n$.

Hence,\nwe are motivated to close the gap by explicitly considering non-deterministic\ntime delay and packet dropout due to unreliable inter-vehicle communications.\nIn particular, we consider a passive safety property, which requests a vehicle\nto avoid any collisions that can be considered as its fault. Under the\nassumption that the communication delay is bounded and we know the upper bound,\nwe then formally verify the passivity safety of a class of hybrid CACC systems.\nThis result allows us to define a safe control envelope that will guide the\nsynthesis of control signals.

The boundedness of the domain precludes the\nneed to impose assumptions on decaying properties of the scalar field at\ninfinity. Moreover, exponential convergence of the swarm density to the\nequilibrium follows from properties of the spectrum of the semigroup generator.\nIn addition, we use the proposed coverage method to construct a\ntime-inhomogenous diffusion process and apply the observability of the heat\nequation to reconstruct the scalar field over the entire domain from\nobservations of the robots' random motion over a small subset of the domain.

On the other hand, using good analysis\ntools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once\nthe analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy\nis straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy\nquantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.\nSince the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic\nlevel of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the\nanalytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and\nsimulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the\npolicy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its\nimplementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The\nmodel was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian\ndynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an\nexperimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed.

    "summary": "The problem of the distributed recovery of jointly sparse signals has\nattracted much attention recently. Let us assume that the nodes of a network\nobserve different sparse signals with common support; starting from linear,\ncompressed measurements, and exploiting network communication, each node aims\nat reconstructing the support and the non-zero values of its observed signal.\nIn the literature, distributed greedy algorithms have been proposed to tackle\nthis problem, among which the most reliable ones require a large amount of\ntransmitted data, which barely adapts to realistic network communication\nconstraints. In this work, we address the problem through a reweighted $\\ell_1$\nsoft thresholding technique, in which the threshold is iteratively tuned based\non the current estimate of the support. The proposed method adapts to\nconstrained networks, as it requires only local communication among neighbors,\nand the transmitted messages are indices from a finite set. We analytically\nprove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we show that it outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art greedy methods in terms of balance between recovery\naccuracy and communication load.",

    "summary": "We consider the following problem - a group of mobile agents perform some\ntask on a terrain modeled as a graph. In a given moment of time an adversary\ngets an access to the graph and positions of the agents. Shortly before\nadversary's observation the mobile agents have a chance to relocate themselves\nin order to hide their initial configuration. We assume that the initial\nconfiguration may possibly reveal to the adversary some information about the\ntask they performed. Clearly agents have to change their location in possibly\nshort time using minimal energy. In our paper we introduce a definition of a\n\\emph{well hiding} algorithm in which the starting and final configurations of\nthe agents have small mutual information. Then we discuss the influence of\nvarious features of the model on the running time of the optimal well-hiding\nalgorithm. We show that if the topology of the graph is known to the agents,\nthen the number of steps proportional to the diameter of the graph is\nsufficient and necessary. In the unknown topology scenario we only consider a\nsingle agent case. We first show that the task is impossible in the\ndeterministic case if the agent has no memory. Then we present a polynomial\nrandomized algorithm. Finally in the model with memory we show that the number\nof steps proportional to the number of edges of the graph is sufficient and\nnecessary. In some sense we investigate how complex is the problem of \"losing\"\ninformation about location (both physical and logical) for different settings.",

    "summary": "Individual robots are not effective at exploring large unmapped areas. An\nalternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,\nrather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm\n(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.\nRobots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets\nin the area without global localization or central control, and return the\ntargets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large\nnumbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas\nresult in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the\nmultiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed\nthroughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but\nreturn to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging\nbehavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic\nalgorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes\nand the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always\nproduces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search\ntime compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the\nadvantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential\ndisadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic\nalgorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less\ncommunication.",

    "summary": "Consensus formation is investigated for multi-agent systems in which agents'\nbeliefs are both vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth\nstate meaning \\emph{borderline}. This is combined with a probabilistic model of\nuncertainty. A belief combination operator is then proposed which exploits\nborderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach a\ncompromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents\napply this operator in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence\nrestriction that the two agents' beliefs must be sufficiently consistent with\neach other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying the consensus\noperator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are\ninfluenced either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the\nformer we conduct simulations which combine consensus formation with belief\nupdating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate the effect of\nassuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible\nthey are in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus\noperators results in the population converging to a single shared belief which\nis both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations which combine consensus\nformation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion which is\ncloser to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only\nchanged as a result of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent\ninteractions are guided by belief quality measured as similarity to the true\nstate of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone results in the\npopulation converging to a high quality shared belief.",

    "summary": "Coalition formation typically involves the coming together of multiple,\nheterogeneous, agents to achieve both their individual and collective goals. In\nthis paper, we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as\nGraph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the\nagents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem\ngiven that in many real-world applications, agents may be connected by a\ncommunication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We\npropose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge\ncontraction, which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF\nproblem as a rooted tree. Then, we propose an anytime solution algorithm\n(CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of\ncharacteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover, we show how CFSS can\nbe efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of\nthe search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios,\nusing a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large\nnumber of households in the UK. Our results show that, in the best case, the\nserial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the\nart, while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on\na 12-core machine. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime\napproximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents\n(i.e., with more than 2700 agents).",

This paper shows that this challenge can now be addressed by\nleveraging the recently introduced System Level Approach (SLA) to controller\nsynthesis. In particular, in the context of the SLA, we define suitable notions\nof separability for control objective functions and system constraints such\nthat the global optimization problem (or iterate update problems of a\ndistributed optimization algorithm) can be decomposed into parallel\nsubproblems. We then further show that if additional locality (i.e., sparsity)\nconstraints are imposed, then these subproblems can be solved using local\nmodels and local decision variables. The SLA is essential to maintaining the\nconvexity of the aforementioned problems under locality constraints. As a\nconsequence, the resulting synthesis methods have $O(1)$ complexity relative to\nthe size of the global system. We further show that many optimal control\nproblems of interest, such as (localized) LQR and LQG, $\\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal\ncontrol with joint actuator and sensor regularization, and (localized) mixed\n$\\mathcal{H}_2/\\mathcal{L}_1$ optimal control problems, satisfy these notions\nof separability, and use these problems to explore tradeoffs in performance,\nactuator and sensing density, and average versus worst-case performance for a\nlarge-scale power inspired system.",

Controllers in V-formation games utilize\na new formulation of model-predictive control we call Adaptive-Horizon MPC\n(AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain\ncontrollability assumptions, an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation\nwith probability 1.\n  We define several classes of attackers, including those that in one move can\nremove R birds from the flock, or introduce random displacement into flock\ndynamics. We consider both naive attackers, whose strategies are purely\nprobabilistic, and AMPC-enabled attackers, putting them on par strategically\nwith the controllers. While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every\ngame with probability 1, in practice, it is resource-constrained: its maximum\nprediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.\nUnder these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a\nV-formation game.\n  Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical\nmodel checking to estimate the probability an attacker can thwart the\ncontroller. Our results show that for the bird-removal game with R = 1, the\ncontroller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For R = 2,\nthe game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed. For the\ndisplacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker,\ni.e. one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive\ncounterpart that randomly executes its attack.",

This paper develops a motion strategy that\nallows robots to safely handle critical communication failures for such\nmulti-robot architectures. For each robot, the proposed algorithm computes a\ntime horizon over which collisions with other robots are guaranteed not to\noccur. These safe time horizons are included in the commands being transmitted\nto the individual robots. In the event of a communication failure, the robots\nexecute the last received velocity commands for the corresponding safe time\nhorizons leading to a provably safe open-loop motion strategy. The resulting\nalgorithm is computationally effective and is agnostic to the task that the\nrobots are performing. The efficacy of the strategy is verified in simulation\nas well as on a team of differential-drive mobile robots.",

    "summary": "Online learning with streaming data in a distributed and collaborative manner\ncan be useful in a wide range of applications. This topic has been receiving\nconsiderable attention in recent years with emphasis on both single-task and\nmultitask scenarios. In single-task adaptation, agents cooperate to track an\nobjective of common interest, while in multitask adaptation agents track\nmultiple objectives simultaneously. Regularization is one useful technique to\npromote and exploit similarity among tasks in the latter scenario. This work\nexamines an alternative way to model relations among tasks by assuming that\nthey all share a common latent feature representation. As a result, a new\nmultitask learning formulation is presented and algorithms are developed for\nits solution in a distributed online manner. We present a unified framework to\nanalyze the mean-square-error performance of the adaptive strategies, and\nconduct simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings and potential\napplications.",

We\nperform this analysis with two scenarios: the sum-profit model, where the\nauctioneer obtains the sum of all submitted bids, and the max-profit model of\ncrowdsourcing contests, where the auctioneer can only use the best submissions\nand thus obtains only the winning bid.\n  Furthermore, we examine various methods of influencing the probability of\nparticipation such as the effects of misreporting one's own probability of\nparticipating, and how influencing another player's participation chances\nchanges the player's strategy.",

It establishes\nequilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems.

It also allows different Hamiltonians\nfor each independent distribution, to facilitate Monte Carlo estimation of\nthose distributions. The approach leads to a novel energy-minimization\nalgorithm in which each coordinate Monte Carlo estimates an associated\nspectrum, and then independently sets its state by sampling a Boltzmann\ndistribution across that spectrum. It can also be used for high-dimensional\nnumerical integration, (constrained) combinatorial optimization, and adaptive\ndistributed control.

In this perspective, the statistical features of the number of\nstates collected by the agents becomes a relevant quantity to understand the\ndynamics of the model, and the influence of topological properties on\nmemory-based models. By means of a master equation approach, we analyze the\ninternal agent dynamics of Naming Game in populations embedded on networks,\nfinding that it strongly depends on very general topological properties of the\nsystem (e.g. average and fluctuations of the degree).

    "summary": "Adaptivity, both of the individual agents and of the interaction structure\namong the agents, seems indispensable for scaling up multi-agent systems\n(MAS's) in noisy environments. One important consideration in designing\nadaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible\nto machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL)\ntechniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting\nagents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the\nagents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg\ngames. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control\nnetwork packet routing.\n  We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps\nsurprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be\nbetter suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential\nperformance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents\nachieve throughputs up to three and one half times better than that of the\nstandard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol\ntraffic is maintained.

It is also a key problem in\nmultiagent systems, but has received little attention here so far. In this\nsetting, the agents may have different preferences that often must be\naggregated using voting. This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,\ninformation should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have\nrevealed about their preferences so far.\n  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the\nmost common voting protocols. It turns out that in the Single Transferable Vote\nprotocol, even knowing when to terminate elicitation is mathcal NP-complete,\nwhile this is easy for all the other protocols under study. Even for these\nprotocols, determining how to elicit effectively is NP-complete, even with\nperfect suspicions about how the agents will vote.

The penalty weights\nassociated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the\nsolution to a linear program.

It also learns to play optimally against opponents that {\\em eventually\nbecome} stationary. The basic idea behind AWESOME ({\\em Adapt When Everybody is\nStationary, Otherwise Move to Equilibrium}) is to try to adapt to the others'\nstrategies when they appear stationary, but otherwise to retreat to a\nprecomputed equilibrium strategy. The techniques used to prove the properties\nof AWESOME are fundamentally different from those used for previous algorithms,\nand may help in analyzing other multiagent learning algorithms also.",

    "summary": "In multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences,\npreference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for\npreference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting\nprotocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting\nprotocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard computationally.\nThe complexity of manipulating realistic elections where the number of\ncandidates is a small constant was recently studied (Conitzer 2002), but the\nemphasis was on the question of whether or not a protocol becomes hard to\nmanipulate for some constant number of candidates. That work, in many cases,\nleft open the question: How many candidates are needed to make elections hard\nto manipulate? This is a crucial question when comparing the relative\nmanipulability of different voting protocols. In this paper we answer that\nquestion for the voting protocols of the earlier study: plurality, Borda, STV,\nCopeland, maximin, regular cup, and randomized cup. We also answer that\nquestion for two voting protocols for which no results on the complexity of\nmanipulation have been derived before: veto and plurality with runoff.

The game is adversarially chosen from some\nfamily that the learner knows. The opponent knows the game and the learner's\nlearning strategy. The learner tries to either not accrue losses, or to quickly\nlearn about the game so as to avoid future losses (this is consistent with the\nWin or Learn Fast (WoLF) principle; BL stands for ``bounded loss''). Our\nframework allows for both probabilistic and approximate learning. The resultant\nnotion of {\\em BL-WoLF}-learnability can be applied to any class of games, and\nallows us to measure the inherent disadvantage to a player that does not know\nwhich game in the class it is in.

A coalition of\nagents can sometimes accomplish things that the individual agents cannot, or\ncan do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a\nsolution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in\nthe sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new\ncoalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game\ntheory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have\nreceived less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software\nagents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly\nexplicit.\n  In this paper we define a concise general representation for games in\ncharacteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for\nefficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core. We then show that\ndetermining whether the core is nonempty is $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete both with\nand without transferable utility. We demonstrate that what makes the problem\nhard in both cases is determining the collaborative possibilities (the set of\noutcomes possible for the grand coalition), by showing that if these are given,\nthe problem becomes tractable in both cases.

Rather than designing these new protocols\nfrom scratch, we instead show how to tweak existing protocols to make\nmanipulation hard, while leaving much of the original nature of the protocol\nintact. The tweak studied consists of adding one elimination preround to the\nelection. Surprisingly, this extremely simple and universal tweak makes typical\nprotocols hard to manipulate! The protocols become NP-hard, #P-hard, or\nPSPACE-hard to manipulate, depending on whether the schedule of the preround is\ndetermined before the votes are collected, after the votes are collected, or\nthe scheduling and the vote collecting are interleaved, respectively.

    "summary": "It has been argued that a central objective of nanotechnology is to make\nproducts inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to\nvery low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a\nstep towards this vision. In previous work (JohnnyVon 1.0), we simulated\nmachines that bonded together to form self-replicating strands. There were two\ntypes of machines (called types 0 and 1), which enabled strands to encode\narbitrary bit strings. However, the information encoded in the strands had no\nfunctional role in the simulation. The information was replicated without being\ninterpreted, which was a significant limitation for potential manufacturing\napplications. In the current work (JohnnyVon 2.0), the information in a strand\nis interpreted as instructions for assembling a polygonal mesh. There are now\nfour types of machines and the information encoded in a strand determines how\nit folds. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight\n(although they flex slightly due to virtual forces acting on the machines), or\nin a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By\nchoosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a\nvariety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial\nunfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates\nby bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the\nencoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form\na mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured\nin the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the\nseed.",

Agents can only communicate with their immediate neighbors in the\nnetwork, but neighboring agents may or may not represent users with common\ninterests. We define two network structures: in the ``mailing-list model,''\nagents representing similar users form cliques, while in the ``word-of-mouth\nmodel'' the agents are distributed randomly in a scale-free network (SFN). In\nboth models, agents tell their neighbors about satisfactory products as they\nare found. In the word-of-mouth model, knowledge of items propagates only\nthrough interested agents, and the SFN parameters affect the system's\nperformance. We include a summary of our new results on the character and\nparameters of random subgraphs of SFNs, in particular SFNs with power-law\ndegree distributions down to minimum degree 1. These networks are not as\nresilient as Cohen et al. originally suggested. In the case of the widely-cited\n``Internet resilience'' result, high failure rates actually lead to the\norphaning of half of the surviving nodes after 60% of the network has failed\nand the complete disintegration of the network at 90%.

    "summary": "It is commonly believed that scale-free networks are robust to massive\nnumbers of random node deletions. For example, Cohen et al. study scale-free\nnetworks including some which approximate the measured degree distribution of\nthe Internet. Their results suggest that if each node in this network failed\nindependently with probability 0.99, the remaining network would continue to\nhave a giant component. In this paper, we show that a large and important\nsubclass of scale-free networks are not robust to massive numbers of random\nnode deletions for practical purposes. In particular, we study finite\nscale-free networks which have minimum node degree of 1 and a power-law degree\ndistribution beginning with nodes of degree 1 (power-law networks). We show\nthat, in a power-law network approximating the Internet's reported\ndistribution, when the probability of deletion of each node is 0.5 only about\n25% of the surviving nodes in the network remain connected in a giant\ncomponent, and the giant component does not persist beyond a critical failure\nrate of 0.9. The new result is partially due to improved analytical\naccommodation of the large number of degree-0 nodes that result after node\ndeletions. Our results apply to finite power-law networks with a wide range of\npower-law exponents, including Internet-like networks. We give both analytical\nand empirical evidence that such networks are not generally robust to massive\nrandom node deletions.",

    "summary": "Emergence (macro-level effects from micro-level causes) is at the heart of\nthe conflict between reductionism and functionalism. How can there be\nautonomous higher level laws of nature (the functionalist claim) if everything\ncan be reduced to the fundamental forces of physics (the reductionist\nposition)? We cut through this debate by applying a computer science lens to\nthe way we view nature. We conclude (a) that what functionalism calls the\nspecial sciences (sciences other than physics) do indeed study autonomous laws\nand furthermore that those laws pertain to real higher level entities but (b)\nthat interactions among such higher-level entities is epiphenomenal in that\nthey can always be reduced to primitive physical forces. In other words,\nepiphenomena, which we will identify with emergent phenomena, do real\nhigher-level work. The proposed perspective provides a framework for\nunderstanding many thorny issues including the nature of entities, stigmergy,\nthe evolution of complexity, phase transitions, supervenience, and downward\nentailment.

Without noise the dynamics of this\nsystem is nearly regular and thereby fails to reproduce the stochastic return\nfluctuations observed in real markets. However, when in each cycle a small\namount of noise is introduced we find the typical features of real financial\ntime series like fat-tails of the return distribution and large temporal\ncorrelations in the volatility without significant correlations in the price\nreturns. Introducing the noise by an evolutionary process leads to different\nscalings of the return distributions that depend on the definition of fitness.\nBecause our realistic model has only very few parameters, and the results\nappear to be robust with respect to the noise level and the number of agents we\nexpect that our framework may serve as new paradigm for modeling self generated\nreturn fluctuations in markets.",

We show that the system undergoes a\ndisorder/order transition, going trough a sharp symmetry breaking process to\nreach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition, the system builds up\nnon-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distribution of\ncompeting synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make the\nsystem ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on\nthe time-scale of collective behaviors, becomes sharper and sharper with system\nsize.

    "summary": "The paper studies the problem of distributed average consensus in sensor\nnetworks with quantized data and random link failures. To achieve consensus,\ndither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When\nthe quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),\nstochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with\nprobability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that\nthe meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link\nweight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study\ndithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is\nbounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded\nquantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the\nsupremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is\naccomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:\none along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to\nthe consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale\nand supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use\nthese probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore\ntradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization\nsteps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy\n$\\epsilon$ away from consensus.

    "summary": "In this work, an ensemble of economic interacting agents is considered. The\nagents are arranged in a linear array where only local couplings are allowed.\nThe deterministic dynamics of each agent is given by a map. This map is\nexpressed by two factors. The first one is a linear term that models the\nexpansion of the agent's economy and that is controlled by the {\\it growth\ncapacity parameter}. The second one is an inhibition exponential term that is\nregulated by the {\\it local environmental pressure}. Depending on the parameter\nsetting, the system can display Pareto or Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior in the\nasymptotic dynamical regime. The regions of parameter space where the system\nexhibits one of these two statistical behaviors are delimited. Other properties\nof the system, such as the mean wealth, the standard deviation and the Gini\ncoefficient, are also calculated.",

    "publish": "2007-12-31T23:22:50Z", 
    "summary": "Many complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the\nconstituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of\nsuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\nagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\nthey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\ncan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\nvalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\nframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\nestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\nmathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\nsuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\nand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\nsampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\ndynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\nof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\nuniversal model for computation.",

    "publish": "2008-01-10T19:45:25Z", 
    "summary": "Computational modelling with multi-agent systems is becoming an important\ntechnique of studying language evolution. We present a brief introduction into\nthis rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an\nanalysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating\nagents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an\nevolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and\nlinguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of\nthe model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically\nunskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with\nlarge learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds\nvia Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language\nand that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the\nincrease of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity\nincreases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several\ntransition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets\nan additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting\nthe evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and\nbiological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect\ncertainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species.",

Agents have the option of\ncontacting a central database for a reliable check of the status of the\nmessage, but this procedure is costly and therefore should be used with\nparsimony. Agents have to evaluate the risk of being infected, and decide if\nand when communicating partners are affordable. Trustability is implemented as\na personal (one-to-one) record of past contacts among agents, and as a\nmean-field monitoring of the level of message corruption. Moreover, this\ninformation is slowly forgotten in time, so that at the end everybody is\nchecked against the database. We explore the behavior of a homogeneous system\nin the case of a fixed pool of spreaders of corrupted messages, and in the case\nof spontaneous appearance of corrupted messages.",

In particular, no complete\naxiomatisation of the logic under scrutiny is needed. This does not only\ncomplement our earlier, syntactic, approach conceptually, but also covers a\nwide variety of new examples which are difficult to harness by purely syntactic\nmeans.

It is able to categorize all cells (or\nmolecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with\nthe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\nfrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\nmessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\nsystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\ndestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\nto previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\nremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\nprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\nrecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\nimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\nfrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\nscience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\nimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\nmethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\nArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\nsuch problem.

In such\ncontrol scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election\nvia actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.\nSP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of\ncandidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'\napproval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred\ncandidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule\ncoerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and\nhybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.\n  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the\ncorresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of\nconstructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to\ncontrol than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a\npolynomial-time winner problem.

Modelling emotions is a\nrelatively recent focus in artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling.\nSuch models can ideally inform our understanding of human behavior. We may see\nthe development of computational models of emotion as a core research focus\nthat will facilitate advances in the large array of computational systems that\nmodel, interpret or influence human behavior. We propose a model based on a\nscalable, flexible and modular approach to emotion which allows runtime\nevaluation between emotional quality and performance. The results achieved\nshowed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly\ninfluence the system performance and there are evident dependency between\nemotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the\ndependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of\nthe team members, and this enable us to conclude that the modular approach to\nemotional programming based on temperamental theory is the good choice to\ndevelop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems.",

Such efforts lead to the emergence of language that\nallows for an efficient communication and exhibits some degree of homonymy and\nsynonymy. Although homonymy reduces the communication efficiency, it seems to\nbe a dynamical trap that persists for a long, and perhaps indefinite, time. On\nthe other hand, synonymy does not reduce the efficiency of communication, but\nappears to be only a transient feature of the language. Thus, in our model the\nrole of synonymy decreases and in the long-time limit it becomes negligible. A\nsimilar rareness of synonymy is observed in present natural languages. The role\nof noise, that distorts the communicated words, is also examined. Although, in\ngeneral, the noise reduces the communication efficiency, it also regroups the\nwords so that they are more evenly distributed within the available \"verbal\"\nspace.",

In the algorithms, each data point in a\ndataset is considered as a particle which can move at random in space according\nto the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also\nviewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its\ntransition probability vector in terms of the feedbacks of all data points, and\nthen its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function.\nFinally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space,\ndata points collect gradually and some separating parts emerge among them\nautomatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are\nlocated at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are\naway from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated\nthat data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently,\nand the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

    "summary": "EVOC (for EVOlution of Culture) is a computer model of culture that enables\nus to investigate how various factors such as barriers to cultural diffusion,\nthe presence and choice of leaders, or changes in the ratio of innovation to\nimitation affect the diversity and effectiveness of ideas. It consists of\nneural network based agents that invent ideas for actions, and imitate\nneighbors' actions. The model is based on a theory of culture according to\nwhich what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal\nmodels of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a\nDarwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving\nexchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of\nactions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of\nactions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and\ndensity, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase\nfitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by\nsharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions\nthroughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces\ndiversity of actions. Increasing the number of leaders reduces this effect.\nEfforts are underway to simulate the conditions under which an agent\nimmigrating from one culture to another contributes new ideas while still\nfitting in.",

We study here\nthe complexity of determining when we can terminate eliciting preferences, and\nprove that the complexity depends on the elicitation strategy. We show, for\ninstance, that it may be better from a computational perspective to elicit all\npreferences from one agent at a time than to elicit individual preferences from\nmultiple agents. We also study the connection between the strategic\nmanipulation of an election and preference elicitation. We show that what we\ncan manipulate affects the computational complexity of manipulation. In\nparticular, we prove that there are voting rules which are easy to manipulate\nif we can change all of an agent's vote, but computationally intractable if we\ncan change only some of their preferences. This suggests that, as with\npreference elicitation, a fine-grained view of manipulation may be informative.\nFinally, we study the connection between predicting the winner of an election\nand preference elicitation. Based on this connection, we identify a voting rule\nwhere it is computationally difficult to decide the probability of a candidate\nwinning given a probability distribution over the votes.",

In\nparticular, purely redundant systems are found to have very little evolvability\nwhile systems with degeneracy, i.e. distributed robustness, can be orders of\nmagnitude more evolvable.

    "summary": "In this paper, we consider a leader-following consensus problem for networks\nof continuous-time integrator agents with a time-varying leader under\nmeasurement noises. We propose a neighbor-based state-estimation protocol for\nevery agent to track the leader, and time-varying consensus gains are\nintroduced to attenuate the noises. By combining the tools of stochastic\nanalysis and algebraic graph theory, we study mean square convergence of this\nmulti-agent system under directed fixed as well as switching interconnection\ntopologies. Sufficient conditions are given for mean square consensus in both\ncases. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our theoretical\nresults.",

    "publish": "2009-09-24T13:41:53Z", 
    "summary": "We consider multi-agent systems where agents' preferences are aggregated via\nsequential majority voting: each decision is taken by performing a sequence of\npairwise comparisons where each comparison is a weighted majority vote among\nthe agents. Incompleteness in the agents' preferences is common in many\nreal-life settings due to privacy issues or an ongoing elicitation process. In\naddition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated.\nFor example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions\nbeing compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to\ndetermine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences\nmay be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is\ncomputationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may\nwin, whatever the agenda. On the other hand, it is computationally hard to know\nwheth er a candidate decision wins in at least one agenda for at least one\ncompletion of the agents' preferences. These results hold even if the agenda\nmust be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of\nmajority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference\nelicitation. They help understand the complexity of tasks such as determining\nif a decision can be taken collectively, as well as knowing if the winner can\nbe manipulated by appropriately ordering the agenda.",

    "summary": "We say that a digraph is essentially cyclic if its Laplacian spectrum is not\ncompletely real. The essential cyclicity implies the presence of directed\ncycles, but not vice versa. The problem of characterizing essential cyclicity\nin terms of graph topology is difficult and yet unsolved. Its solution is\nimportant for some applications of graph theory, including that in\ndecentralized control. In the present paper, this problem is solved with\nrespect to the class of digraphs with ring structure, which models some typical\ncommunication networks. It is shown that the digraphs in this class are\nessentially cyclic, except for certain specified digraphs. The main technical\ntool we employ is the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. A by-product of\nthis study is a theorem on the zeros of polynomials that differ by one from the\nproducts of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. We also consider the\nproblem of essential cyclicity for weighted digraphs and enumerate the spanning\ntrees in some digraphs with ring structure.",

    "publish": "2009-11-02T04:23:25Z", 
    "summary": "It is an amazing fact that remarkably complex behaviors could emerge from a\nlarge collection of very rudimentary dynamical agents through very simple local\ninteractions. However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local\ninteractions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective\nbehaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a\ndivide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through\nlocal coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team\nof three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure.",

It also\nappears to be one of the harder rules to manipulate since it involves multiple\nrounds and since, unlike many other rules, it is NP-hard for a single agent to\nmanipulate without weights on the votes or uncertainty about how the other\nagents have voted. In almost every election in our experiments, it was easy to\ncompute how a single agent could manipulate the election or to prove that\nmanipulation by a single agent was impossible.

We have developed simulation\nmodels based on research by a multi-disciplinary team of economists, work\npsychologists and computer scientists.

Best practices have\nbeen developed, but when it comes down to the actual application of these\nguidelines considerable ambiguity remains regarding their effectiveness within\nparticular contexts (Siebers et al., forthcoming a). Most Operational Research\n(OR) methods can only be used as analysis tools once management practices have\nbeen implemented. Often they are not very useful for giving answers to\nspeculative 'what-if' questions, particularly when one is interested in the\ndevelopment of the system over time rather than just the state of the system at\na certain point in time. Simulation can be used to analyse the operation of\ndynamic and stochastic systems. ABS is particularly useful when complex\ninteractions between system entities exist, such as autonomous decision making\nor negotiation. In an ABS model the researcher explicitly describes the\ndecision process of simulated actors at the micro level. Structures emerge at\nthe macro level as a result of the actions of the agents and their interactions\nwith other agents and the environment. 3 We will show how ABS experiments can\ndeal with testing and optimising management practices such as training,\nempowerment or teamwork.

    "summary": "Analysis of aggregate and individual Web traffic has shown that PageRank is a\npoor model of how people navigate the Web. Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web\ntraffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both\naggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link\ntraffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model\ncurrently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show\nthat all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model\nthat takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited\nlinks, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as\nthe use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by\nvisiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more\ntopically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the\nprobability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing\nus to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of\nreproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical\ndata, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users\nwith the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result\nallows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient\nto interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data. In addition to the\ndescriptive and explanatory power of such a model, our results may lead the way\nto more sophisticated, realistic, and effective ranking and crawling\nalgorithms.",

    "summary": "It is well-known that the behavior of many dynamical processes running on\nnetworks is intimately related to the eigenvalue spectrum of the network. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of inferring global information regarding\nthe eigenvalue spectrum of a network from a set of local samples of its\nstructure. In particular, we find explicit relationships between the so-called\nspectral moments of a graph and the presence of certain small subgraphs, also\ncalled motifs, in the network. Since the eigenvalues of the network have a\ndirect influence on the network dynamical behavior, our result builds a bridge\nbetween local network measurements (i.e., the presence of small subgraphs) and\nglobal dynamical behavior (via the spectral moments). Furthermore, based on our\nresult, we propose a novel decentralized scheme to compute the spectral moments\nof a network by aggregating local measurements of the network topology. Our\nfinal objective is to understand the relationships between the behavior of\ndynamical processes taking place in a large-scale complex network and its local\ntopological properties.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the effectiveness of creative versus uncreative\nleadership using EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution. Each\niteration, each agent in the artificial society invents a new action, or\nimitates a neighbor's action. Only the leader's actions can be imitated by all\nother agents, referred to as followers. Two measures of creativity were used:\n(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent\ninvents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how\ncreative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but\nonly when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with\ngreater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High\ncLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;\nin the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and\ntentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed.",

    "summary": "Voting is a simple mechanism to combine together the preferences of multiple\nagents. Agents may try to manipulate the result of voting by mis-reporting\ntheir preferences. One barrier that might exist to such manipulation is\ncomputational complexity. In particular, it has been shown that it is NP-hard\nto compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules. However,\nNP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results\nsuggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. In this paper, we\nstudy empirically the manipulability of single transferable voting (STV) to\ndetermine if computational complexity is really a barrier to manipulation. STV\nwas one of the first voting rules shown to be NP-hard. It also appears one of\nthe harder voting rules to manipulate. We sample a number of distributions of\nvotes including uniform and real world elections. In almost every election in\nour experiments, it was easy to compute how a single agent could manipulate the\nelection or to prove that manipulation by a single agent was impossible.",

    "summary": "New operating systems for mobile devices allow their users to download\nmillions of applications created by various individual programmers, some of\nwhich may be malicious or flawed. In order to detect that an application is\nmalicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant\nperiod of time is often required. Mobile devices have limited computation and\npower resources and thus are limited in their monitoring capabilities. In this\npaper we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses\nthe collective resources of many mobile devices, \"vaccinating\" them against\npotentially unsafe applications. We suggest a new local information flooding\nalgorithm called \"TTL Probabilistic Propagation\" (TPP). The algorithm\nperiodically monitors one or more application and reports its conclusions to a\nsmall number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information\nonwards. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform existing state\nof the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as\nwell as network overhead. The maximal \"load\" of the algorithm (the fastest\narrival rate of new suspicious applications, that can still guarantee complete\nmonitoring), is analytically calculated and shown to be significantly superior\ncompared to any non-collaborative approach. Finally, we show both analytically\nand experimentally using real world network data that implementing the proposed\nalgorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. In\naddition, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to several types\nof Byzantine attacks where some adversarial agents may generate false\ninformation, or abuse the algorithm in other ways.",

    "summary": "The eigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a network is closely\nrelated to the behavior of many dynamical processes run over the network. In\nthe field of robotics, this spectrum has important implications in many\nproblems that require some form of distributed coordination within a team of\nrobots. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time control scheme that\nmodifies the structure of a position-dependent network of mobile robots so that\nit achieves a desired set of adjacency eigenvalues. For this, we employ a novel\nabstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum by means of the adjacency matrix\nspectral moments. Since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by its\nspectral moments, this abstraction provides a way to indirectly control the\neigenvalues of the network. Our construction is based on artificial potentials\nthat capture the distance of the network's spectral moments to their desired\nvalues. Minimization of these potentials is via a gradient descent closed-loop\nsystem that, under certain convexity assumptions, ensures convergence of the\nnetwork topology to one with the desired set of moments and, therefore,\neigenvalues. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations.",

Their\ndecision depends on the trade-off between their perceived risk of being\ninfected and the cost of being protected. The network members can make\ndecisions repeatedly, based on information that they receive about the changing\ninfection level in the network.\n  We study the equilibrium states reached by a network whose members increase\n(resp. decrease) their security deployment when learning that the network\ninfection is widespread (resp. limited). Our main finding is that the\nequilibrium level of infection increases as the learning rate of the members\nincreases. We confirm this result in three scenarios for the behavior of the\nmembers: strictly rational cost minimizers, not strictly rational, and strictly\nrational but split into two response classes. In the first two cases, we\ncompletely characterize the stability and the domains of attraction of the\nequilibrium points, even though the first case leads to a differential\ninclusion.

    "summary": "We study policies aiming to minimize the weighted sum of completion times of\njobs in the context of coordination mechanisms for selfish scheduling problems.\nOur goal is to design local policies that achieve a good price of anarchy in\nthe resulting equilibria for unrelated machine scheduling. To obtain the\napproximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually\nsimple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the\nfollowing results.\n  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in\nascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an\napproximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible\nfor deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is\nalways optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then\nshow that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or\nrandomization is allowed.\n  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,\nachieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation\nratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is\nnegligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \\pi\n/2.\n  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential\ngames, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule). This\nalso allows us to design the first \\emph{combinatorial} constant-factor\napproximation algorithm minimizing weighted completion time for unrelated\nmachine scheduling that achieves a factor of 2+ \\epsilon for any \\epsilon > 0.",

    "summary": "We consider a set of agents who are attempting to iteratively learn the\n'state of the world' from their neighbors in a social network. Each agent\ninitially receives a noisy observation of the true state of the world. The\nagents then repeatedly 'vote' and observe the votes of some of their peers,\nfrom which they gain more information. The agents' calculations are Bayesian\nand aim to myopically maximize the expected utility at each iteration.\n  This model, introduced by Gale and Kariv (2003), is a natural approach to\nlearning on networks. However, it has been criticized, chiefly because the\nagents' decision rule appears to become computationally intractable as the\nnumber of iterations advances. For instance, a dynamic programming approach\n(part of this work) has running time that is exponentially large in \\min(n,\n(d-1)^t), where n is the number of agents.\n  We provide a new algorithm to perform the agents' computations on locally\ntree-like graphs. Our algorithm uses the dynamic cavity method to drastically\nreduce computational effort. Let d be the maximum degree and t be the iteration\nnumber. The computational effort needed per agent is exponential only in O(td)\n(note that the number of possible information sets of a neighbor at time t is\nitself exponential in td).\n  Under appropriate assumptions on the rate of convergence, we deduce that each\nagent is only required to spend polylogarithmic (in 1/\\eps) computational\neffort to approximately learn the true state of the world with error\nprobability \\eps, on regular trees of degree at least five. We provide\nnumerical and other evidence to justify our assumption on convergence rate.\n  We extend our results in various directions, including loopy graphs. Our\nresults indicate efficiency of iterative Bayesian social learning in a wide\nrange of situations, contrary to widely held beliefs.",

    "summary": "We consider continuous-time consensus seeking systems whose time-dependent\ninteractions are cut-balanced, in the following sense: if a group of agents\ninfluences the remaining ones, the former group is also influenced by the\nremaining ones by at least a proportional amount. Models involving symmetric\ninterconnections and models in which a weighted average of the agent values is\nconserved are special cases. We prove that such systems always converge. We\ngive a sufficient condition on the evolving interaction topology for the limit\nvalues of two agents to be the same. Conversely, we show that if our condition\nis not satisfied, then these limits are generically different. These results\nallow treating systems where the agent interactions are a priori unknown, e.g.,\nrandom or determined endogenously by the agent values.

    "summary": "Consider a sensor network made of remote nodes connected to a common fusion\ncenter. In a recent work Blum and Sadler [1] propose the idea of ordered\ntransmissions -sensors with more informative samples deliver their messages\nfirst- and prove that optimal detection performance can be achieved using only\na subset of the total messages. Taking to one extreme this approach, we show\nthat just a single delivering allows making the detection errors as small as\ndesired, for a sufficiently large network size: a one-bit detection scheme can\nbe asymptotically consistent. The transmission ordering is based on the modulus\nof some local statistic (MO system). We derive analytical results proving the\nasymptotic consistency and, for the particular case that the local statistic is\nthe log-likelihood (\\ell-MO system), we also obtain a bound on the error\nconvergence rate. All the theorems are proved under the general setup of random\nnumber of sensors. Computer experiments corroborate the analysis and address\ntypical examples of applications including: non-homogeneous Poisson-deployed\nnetworks, detection by per-sensor censoring, monitoring of energy-constrained\nphenomenon.",

The fundamental philosophy of the\nproposed approach is to percolate local information across the swarm, enabling\nagents to indirectly access the global context. A gradient emerges, reflecting\nthe performance of agents, computed in a distributed manner via local\ninformation exchange between neighboring agents. It is shown that to follow\nnear-optimal routes to a target which can be only sensed locally, and whose\nlocation is not known a priori, the agents need to simply move towards its\n\"best\" neighbor, where the notion of \"best\" is obtained by computing the\nstate-specific language measure of an underlying probabilistic finite state\nautomata.

This\napproximation will converge as the number of samples goes to infinity, however,\nthe complexity of the resulting control problem is so high that this approach\nproves unsuitable for control under real-time requirements. To alleviate the\ncomputational burden we propose a second approach that uses probabilistic\nbounds to determine regions with increased probability of presence for each\nagent and formulate constraints for the control problem that guarantee that\nthese regions will not overlap. We prove that the resulting problem is\nconservative for the original problem with probabilistic constraints, ie. every\ncontrol strategy that is feasible under our new constraints will automatically\nbe feasible for the original problem. Furthermore we show in simulations in a\nUAV path planning scenario that our proposed approach grants significantly\nbetter run-time performance compared to a controller with the sample-based\napproximation with only a small degree of sub-optimality resulting from the\nconservativeness of our new approach.",

However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.\nThere are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely\nbe nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of\nmanipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked\nelectorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems.

    "summary": "Scoring rules for eliciting expert predictions of random variables are\nusually developed assuming that experts derive utility only from the quality of\ntheir predictions (e.g., score awarded by the rule, or payoff in a prediction\nmarket). We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a\ndecision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and\n(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a\ncorporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility\nfrom the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually\nhave an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the\ndecision maker if typical scoring rules are used. We develop a general model\nfor this setting and introduce the concept of a compensation rule. When\ncombined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule\ninduces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming\nfull knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all\n(strictly) proper compensation rules. We then analyze the situation where the\nexpert's utility function is not fully known to the decision maker. We show\nbounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert\nwill misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty.\nThese bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local\ndegree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the\ndecision maker's utility function. They also suggest optimization procedures\nfor the design of compensation rules. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of\ncompensation rules as market scoring rules for self-interested experts in a\nprediction market.",

The interest in these\nequilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they\ncan be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To\nachieve these equilibria, several learning techniques, namely, the best\nresponse dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, and regret matching, are discussed in terms of information\nrequirements and convergence properties.

    "publish": "2011-06-16T03:16:20Z", 
    "summary": "New advances in large scale distributed systems have amazingly offered\ncomplex functionalities through parallelism of simple and rudimentary\ncomponents. The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the\nsynthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the\nentire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,\nthree fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for\ntop-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down\ndesign, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite\nof some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an\nundecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework. The\nfirst two problems have been addressed in our previous works, by identifying\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for task automaton decomposition, and\nfault-tolerant task decomposability. This paper deals with the third problem\nand proposes a procedure to redistribute the events among agents in order to\nenforce decomposability of an undecomposable task automaton. The\ndecomposability conditions are used to identify the root causes of\nundecomposability which are found to be due to over-communications that have to\nbe deleted, while respecting the fault-tolerant decomposability conditions; or\nbecause of the lack of communications that require new sharing of events, while\nconsidering new violations of decomposability conditions. This result provides\na sufficient condition to make any undecomposable deterministic task automaton\ndecomposable in order to facilitate cooperative tasking.

Given such an\ninformation set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the\nmanipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and\nsometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully.\nWhen the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there\nexists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known\nresults). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no\ndominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's\ninformation is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the\npreferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for\nmany common voting rules.

Both directed and bidirectional communication graphs are studied.\nConnectivity conditions are proposed to guarantee an optimal consensus almost\nsurely with proper convexity and intersection assumptions. The convergence\nanalysis is carried out using convex analysis. We compare the randomized\nalgorithm with the deterministic one via a numerical example. The results\nillustrate that a group of autonomous agents can reach an optimal opinion by\neach node simply making a randomized trade-off between following its neighbors\nor sticking to its own opinion at each time step.",

    "summary": "Teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) form typical networked\ncyber-physical systems that involve the interaction of discrete logic and\ncontinuous dynamics. This paper presents a hybrid supervisory control framework\nfor the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmanned\nhelicopters. The proposed hybrid control framework captures internal\ninteractions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuous\ndynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. To\ndesign such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space is\nproposed as a new method of abstraction. Utilizing the properties of\nmulti-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite state\nDiscrete Event System (DES) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to the\noriginal continuous-variable dynamical system. Then, in the discrete domain, a\nlogic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. Due to the\nbisimilarity between the abstracted DES model and the original UAV dynamics,\nthe designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller through\nan interface layer. This supervisor drives the UAV dynamics to satisfy the\ndesign requirements. In other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring the\nUAVs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside the\ncontrol horizon and then, maintain the formation. Moreover, a collision\navoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. Finally, the\nalgorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,\nwhich is developed for unmanned helicopters. The presented results show the\neffectiveness of the algorithm.",

These intracellular particles can be found in four different modes of\n(undirected and directed) motion and can fuse with other vesicles. While the\nsize of vesicles follows a log-normal distribution that changes over time due\nto fusion processes, their spatial distribution gives rise to distinct\npatterns. Their occurrence depends on the concentration of proteins which are\nsynthesized based on the transcriptional activities of some genes. Hence,\ndifferences in these spatio-temporal vesicle patterns allow indirect\nconclusions about the (unknown) impact of these genes.\n  By means of agent-based computer simulations we are able to reproduce such\npatterns on real temporal and spatial scales. Our modeling approach is based on\nBrownian agents with an internal degree of freedom, $\\theta$, that represents\nthe different modes of motion. Conditions inside the cell are modeled by an\neffective potential that differs for agents dependent on their value $\\theta$.\nAgent's motion in this effective potential is modeled by an overdampted\nLangevin equation, changes of $\\theta$ are modeled as stochastic transitions\nwith values obtained from experiments, and fusion events are modeled as\nspace-dependent stochastic transitions. Our results for the spatio-temporal\nvesicle patterns can be used for a statistical comparison with experiments.

    "summary": "Research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts\nparadigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act\nmodels of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for\ncommunication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be\nextremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent\ncommunication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics\ntypically make reference to the \"mental states\" of agents (their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such\nattitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming\nlanguages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone\nversions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to\ncommunication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather\nad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to\nspeech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a\nlogic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of\nthe PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural\noperational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The\nmain contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier\nwork on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a\ncomputationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in\nspeech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of\nAgentSpeak that supports agent communication.",

To this end, we introduce the notion of\n\\emph{Network Tracing Capacity} (NTC), which is defined as the largest two-norm\nof the system matrix that can be estimated with bounded error. Extending this\nto fully-connected networks or infinite information exchanges (per dynamical\nsystem evolution-step), we note that the NTC is infinite, i.e., any dynamical\nsystem can be estimated with bounded error. In short, the NTC characterizes the\nestimation capability of a sparse network by relating it to the evolution of\nthe underlying dynamical system.",

Every camera in the network has limited communication\ncapabilities and can only exchange local matches with its neighbors. We propose\na distributed algorithm that takes these local matches and computes global\ncorrespondences by a proper propagation in the network. When the algorithm\nfinishes, each camera knows the global correspondences between its features and\nthe features of all the cameras in the network. The presence of spurious\nintroduced by the local matcher may produce inconsistent global\ncorrespondences, which are association paths between features from the same\ncamera. The contributions of this work are the propagation of the local matches\nand the detection and resolution of these inconsistencies by deleting local\nmatches. Our resolution algorithm considers the quality of each local match,\nwhen this information is provided by the local matcher. We formally prove that\nafter executing the algorithm, the network finishes with a global data\nassociation free of inconsistencies. We provide a fully decentralized solution\nto the problem which does not rely on any particular communication topology.\nSimulations and experimental results with real images show the performance of\nthe method considering different features, matching functions and scenarios.",

We consider how these measures\nscale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in\n1, 2 and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1\ndimensional case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension\nimplies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3\nbeing necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations\nunder certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have\nlarge coherent one dimensional vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We\nanalyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion,\nshowing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting\nin an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in\nlow spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale\ndisturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions.

We also identify a class of\nconvex problems for double-integrators by restricting the controller to\nsymmetric position and uniform diagonal velocity gains. To obtain the optimal\nnon-symmetric gains for both the single- and the double-integrator models, we\nsolve a parameterized family of optimal control problems ranging from an easily\nsolvable problem to the problem of interest as the underlying parameter\nincreases. When this parameter is kept small, we employ perturbation analysis\nto decouple the matrix equations that result from the optimality conditions,\nthereby rendering the unique optimal feedback gain. This solution is used to\ninitialize a homotopy-based Newton's method to find the optimal localized gain.\nTo investigate the performance of localized controllers, we examine how the\ncoherence of large-scale stochastically forced formations scales with the\nnumber of vehicles.

An important\ncontribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in\nthe setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\\star, and the like.\nRecently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which\nwe denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for\nreasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order\nquantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific\nsetting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking\nalgorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim\nthat it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,\nfor reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that\nSL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In\nparticular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the\nbest one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is\nNonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate\nhere syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\\star, with the hope of\nobtaining an elementary model-checking problem.

    "publish": "2012-02-09T10:48:37Z", 
    "summary": "Several Mobile Agent based distributed network management models have been\nproposed in recent times to address the scalability and flexibility problems of\ncentralized (SNMP or CMIP management models) models. Though the use of Mobile\nAgents to distribute and delegate management tasks comes handy in dealing with\nthe previously stated issues, many of the agent-based management frameworks\nlike initial flat bed models and static mid-level managers employing mobile\nagents models cannot efficiently meet the demands of current networks which are\ngrowing in size and complexity. Moreover, varied technologies, such as SONET,\nATM, Ethernet, DWDM etc., present at different layers of the Access, Metro and\nCore (long haul) sections of the network, have contributed to the complexity in\nterms of their own framing and protocol structures. Thus, controlling and\nmanaging the traffic in these networks is a challenging task. This paper\npresents an intelligent scalable hierarchical agent based model for the\nmanagement of large-scale complex networks to address aforesaid issues. The\ncost estimation, carried out with a view to compute the overall management cost\nin terms of management data overhead, is being presented. The results obtained\nthereafter establish the usefulness of the presented architecture as compare to\ncentralized and flat bed agent based models.",

However, assessing the suitability of countermeasures at this scale is\nhard. In this paper, we use an agent-based model, called ASIM, to investigate\nthe impact of policy interventions at the Autonomous System level of the\nInternet. For instance, we find that coordinated intervention by the\n0.2%-biggest ASes is more effective than uncoordinated efforts adopted by 30%\nof all ASes. Furthermore, countermeasures that block malicious transit traffic\nappear more effective than ones that block outgoing traffic. The model allows\nus to quantify and compare positive externalities created by different\ncountermeasures. Our results give an initial indication of the types and levels\nof intervention that are most cost-effective at large scale.",

    "summary": "Most work on manipulation assumes that all preferences are known to the\nmanipulators. However, in many settings elections are open and sequential, and\nmanipulators may know the already cast votes but may not know the future votes.\nWe introduce a framework, in which manipulators can see the past votes but not\nthe future ones, to model online coalitional manipulation of sequential\nelections, and we show that in this setting manipulation can be extremely\ncomplex even for election systems with simple winner problems. Yet we also show\nthat for some of the most important election systems such manipulation is\nsimple in certain settings. This suggests that when using sequential voting,\none should pay great attention to the details of the setting in choosing one's\nvoting rule. Among the highlights of our classifications are: We show that,\ndepending on the size of the manipulative coalition, the online manipulation\nproblem can be complete for each level of the polynomial hierarchy or even for\nPSPACE. We obtain the most dramatic contrast to date between the\nnonunique-winner and unique-winner models: Online weighted manipulation for\nplurality is in P in the nonunique-winner model, yet is coNP-hard (constructive\ncase) and NP-hard (destructive case) in the unique-winner model.

We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential\nelections. We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the\nstandard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient\nwinner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is\nPSPACE-complete, even if there are only two candidates. In addition, we obtain\n(by a new characterization of coNP in terms of weight-bounded alternating\nTuring machines) completeness for coNP in the deleting/adding cases with a\nbounded deletion/addition limit, and we obtain completeness for NP in the\npartition cases with an additional restriction.

We\nexperimentally tackle NP-hard control problems for Bucklin and fallback voting.\nAmong natural voting systems with efficient winner determination, fallback\nvoting is currently known to display the broadest resistance to control in\nterms of NP-hardness, and Bucklin voting has been shown to behave almost as\nwell in terms of control resistance [ER10, EPR11, EFPR11].

    "summary": "How does one allocate a collection of resources to a set of strategic agents\nin a fair and efficient manner without using money? For in many scenarios it is\nnot feasible to use money to compensate agents for otherwise unsatisfactory\noutcomes. This paper studies this question, looking at both fairness and\nefficiency measures.\n  We employ the proportionally fair solution, which is a well-known fairness\nconcept for money-free settings. But although finding a proportionally fair\nsolution is computationally tractable, it cannot be implemented in a truthful\nfashion. Consequently, we seek approximate solutions. We give several truthful\nmechanisms which achieve proportional fairness in an approximate sense. We use\na strong notion of approximation, requiring the mechanism to give each agent a\ngood approximation of its proportionally fair utility. In particular, one of\nour mechanisms provides a better and better approximation factor as the minimum\ndemand for every good increases. A motivating example is provided by the\nmassive privatization auction in the Czech republic in the early 90s.\n  With regard to efficiency, prior work has shown a lower bound of 0.5 on the\napproximation factor of any swap-dictatorial mechanism approximating a social\nwelfare measure even for the two agents and multiple goods case. We surpass\nthis lower bound by designing a non-swap-dictatorial mechanism for this case.\nInterestingly, the new mechanism builds on the notion of proportional fairness.",

Nested knowledge and event\nordering are shown to be related even when the nesting order does not match the\ntemporal order of occurrence.

On what is fashionable, interestingly, there are\ntwo viewpoints that are both extremely widespread but almost opposite:\nconformists think that what is popular is fashionable, while rebels believe\nthat being different is the essence. Fashion color is fashionable in the first\nsense, and Lady Gaga in the second. We investigate a model where the population\nconsists of the afore-mentioned two groups of people that are located on social\nnetworks (a spatial cellular automata network and small-world networks). This\nmodel captures two fundamental kinds of social interactions (coordination and\nanti-coordination) simultaneously, and also has its own interest to game\ntheory: it is a hybrid model of pure competition and pure cooperation. This is\ntrue because when a conformist meets a rebel, they play the zero sum matching\npennies game, which is pure competition. When two conformists (rebels) meet,\nthey play the (anti-) coordination game, which is pure cooperation. Simulation\nshows that simple social interactions greatly promote cooperation: in most\ncases people can reach an extraordinarily high level of cooperation, through a\nselfish, myopic, naive, and local interacting dynamic (the best response\ndynamic). We find that degree of synchronization also plays a critical role,\nbut mostly on the negative side. Four indices, namely cooperation degree,\naverage satisfaction degree, equilibrium ratio and complete ratio, are defined\nand applied to measure people's cooperation levels from various angles. Phase\ntransition, as well as emergence of many interesting geographic patterns in the\ncellular automata network, is also observed.",

We\nsurvey algorithms and impossibility results for the synthesis problem, i.e.,\nconverting a representation of a simple game into another representation.\n  We contribute to the synthesis problem by showing that it is impossible to\ncompute in polynomial time the list of ceiling coalitions (also known as\nshift-maximal losing coalitions) of a game from its list of roof coalitions\n(also known as shift-minimal winning coalitions), and vice versa.\n  Then, we proceed by studying the problem of enumerating the set of weighted\nvoting games. We present first a naive algorithm for this, running in doubly\nexponential time. Using our knowledge of the synthesis problem, we then improve\non this naive algorithm, and we obtain an enumeration algorithm that runs in\nquadratic exponential time (that is, O(2^(n^2) p(n)) for a polynomial p).\nMoreover, we show that this algorithm runs in output-polynomial time, making it\nthe best possible enumeration algorithm up to a polynomial factor.\n  Finally, we propose an exact anytime algorithm for the inverse power index\nproblem that runs in exponential time.

A larger team has a higher probability of finding the balloon, but we\nassume that the prize money is divided equally among the team members. Hence\nthere is a competing tension to keep teams as small as possible.\n  \\emph{Risk aversion} is the reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with\nan uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but\npossibly lower, expected payoff. In our model we consider the \\emph{isoelastic}\nutility function derived from the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk\naversion. The main aim is to analyze the structures of the groups in Nash\nequilibria for our model. For the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space ($d\\geq 1$)\nand the class of bounded degree regular graphs we show that in any Nash\nEquilibrium the \\emph{richest} group (having maximum expected utility per\nperson) covers a constant fraction of the total volume.",

    "publish": "2012-04-30T13:58:47Z", 
    "summary": "Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is\nimportant when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. A simple model\nwas proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to\ntheir size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate\nto other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces\nrealistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf\ndistribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense\nthat mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly\nhigh density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution\nof external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.\n  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both\ncentripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the\nsense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a\nhigher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an\naversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The\nmodel is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial\nsetting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons\nare made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a\nseries of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of\nthe degree of clustering and concentration.",

    "summary": "In a distributed algorithm, multiple processes, or agents, work toward a\ncommon goal. More often than not, the actions of some agents are dependent on\nthe previous execution (if not also on the outcome) of the actions of other\nagents. The resulting interdependencies between the timings of the actions of\nthe various agents give rise to the study of methods for timely coordination of\nthese actions.\n  In this work, we formulate and mathematically analyze \"Timely-Coordinated\nResponse\" - a novel multi-agent coordination problem in which the time\ndifference between each pair of actions may be constrained by upper and/or\nlower bounds. This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied\nby Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.\n  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a\ngeneralization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a\ngeneralization of the \"syncausality\" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses. We\nconstructively show the equivalence of the solutions yielded by both\napproaches, and by combining them, derive strengthened versions of known\nresults for some previously-defined special cases of this problem.\n  Our analysis is conducted under minimal assumptions: we work in a\ncontinuous-time model with possibly infinitely many agents. The general results\nwe obtain for this model reduce to stronger ones for discrete-time models with\nonly finitely many agents. In order to distill the properties of such models\nthat are significant to this reduction, we define several classes of\nnaturally-occurring models, which in a sense separate the different results. We\npresent both a more practical optimal solution, as well as a surprisingly\nsimple condition for solvability, for timely coordinated response under these\nmodels.\n  Finally, we show how our results generalize the results known for\npreviously-studied special cases of this problem.",

The robots can mark\nvisited places with pheromone marks and sense the level of the pheromone in\ntheir local neighborhood. In case of multiple robots these pheromone marks can\nbe sensed by all robots and provide the only way of (indirect) communication\nbetween the robots. The robots are assumed to be memoryless, and to have no\nglobal information such as the domain map, their own position (either absolute\nor relative), total marked area percentage, maximal pheromone level, etc..\nDespite the robots' simplicity, we show that they are able, by running a very\nsimple rule of behavior, to ensure efficient covering of arbitrary connected\ndomains, including non-planar and multidimensional ones. The novelty of our\nalgorithm lies in the fact that, unlike previously proposed methods, our\nalgorithm works on continuous domains without relying on some \"induced\"\nunderlying graph, that effectively reduces the problem to a discrete case of\ngraph covering. The algorithm guarantees complete coverage of any connected\ndomain. We also prove that the algorithm is noise immune, i.e., it is able to\ncope with any initial pheromone profile (noise). In addition the algorithm\nprovides a bounded constant time between two successive visits of the robot,\nand thus, is suitable for patrolling or surveillance applications.",

    "summary": "Recently, a theory for stochastic optimal control in non-linear dynamical\nsystems in continuous space-time has been developed (Kappen, 2005). We apply\nthis theory to collaborative multi-agent systems. The agents evolve according\nto a given non-linear dynamics with additive Wiener noise. Each agent can\ncontrol its own dynamics. The goal is to minimize the accumulated joint cost,\nwhich consists of a state dependent term and a term that is quadratic in the\ncontrol. We focus on systems of non-interacting agents that have to distribute\nthemselves optimally over a number of targets, given a set of end-costs for the\ndifferent possible agent-target combinations. We show that optimal control is\nthe combinatorial sum of independent single-agent single-target optimal\ncontrols weighted by a factor proportional to the end-costs of the different\ncombinations. Thus, multi-agent control is related to a standard graphical\nmodel inference problem. The additional computational cost compared to\nsingle-agent control is exponential in the tree-width of the graph specifying\nthe combinatorial sum times the number of targets. We illustrate the result by\nsimulations of systems with up to 42 agents.",

Interest in population-level cellular\nbehaviour is increasing, due to both our expanding knowledge of the underlying\nbiological principles, and the growing range of possible applications for\nengineered microbial consortia. Researchers in the field of synthetic biology -\nthe application of engineering principles to living systems - have, for\nexample, recently shown how useful decision-making circuits may be distributed\nacross a bacterial population. The ability of cells to interact through small\nsignalling molecules (a mechanism known as it quorum sensing) is the basis for\nthe majority of existing engineered systems.

Under these\nassumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is\nEXPSPACE-complete.

For both weighted\nand unweighted voting, we show that even for election systems with simple\nwinner problems the complexity of manipulation, manipulation with runoffs, and\nmanipulation with revoting runoffs are independent, in the abstract. On the\nother hand, for some important, well-known election systems we determine what\nholds for each of these cases. For no such systems do we find runoffs lowering\ncomplexity, and for some we find that runoffs raise complexity. Ours is the\nfirst paper to show that for natural, unweighted election systems, runoffs can\nincrease the manipulation complexity.",

    "summary": "This volume contains the proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on\nStrategic Reasoning 2013 (SR 2013), held in Rome (Italy), March 1617, 2013. The\nSR workshop aims to bring together researchers, possibly with different\nbackgrounds, working on various aspects of strategic reasoning in computer\nscience, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. This year SR\nhas hosted four outstanding invited talks by Krishnendu Chatterjee, Alessio R.\nLomuscio, Jean-Francois Raskin, and Michael Wooldridge. Moreover, the program\ncommittee selected 13 papers among the 23 contributions submitted. Almost all\nof them have been revised by three reviews and the contributions have been\nselected according to quality and relevance to the topics of the workshop.",

    "publish": "2013-03-04T19:06:40Z", 
    "summary": "We propose a validity preserving translation from a subset of epistemic\nAlternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) to epistemic Computation Tree Logic\n(CTL). The considered subset of epistemic ATL is known to have the finite model\nproperty and decidable model-checking. This entails the decidability of\nvalidity but the implied algorithm is unfeasible. Reducing the validity problem\nto that in a corresponding system of CTL makes the techniques for automated\ndeduction for that logic available for the handling of the apparently more\ncomplex system of ATL.",

    "publish": "2013-03-09T06:16:02Z", 
    "summary": "This paper provides a statistical characterization of the individual\nachievable rates in bits/s/Hz and the spatial throughput of bipolar Poisson\nwireless networks in bits/s/Hz/m$^2$. We assume that all transmitters have a\ncognitive ability to know the distance to their receiver's closest interferers\nso they can individually tune their coding rates to avoid outage events for\neach spatial realization. Considering that the closest interferer approximates\nthe aggregate interference of all transmitters treated as noise, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the probability density function of the achievable\nrates under two decoding rules: treating interference as noise, and jointly\ndetecting the strongest interfering signals treating the others as noise. Based\non these rules and the bipolar model, we approximate the expected maximum\nspatial throughput, showing the best performance of the latter decoding rule.\nThese results are also compared to the reference scenario where the\ntransmitters do not have cognitive ability, coding their messages at\npredetermined rates that are chosen to optimize the expected spatial throughput\n-- regardless of particular realizations -- which yields outages. We prove\nthat, when the same decoding rule and network density are considered, the\ncognitive spatial throughput always outperforms the other option.",
